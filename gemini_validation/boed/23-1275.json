    "facts_of_the_case": "Medicaid, established in 1965, is a cooperative federal-state program that provides medical assistance to needy individuals. The program offers federal funding to states that agree to comply with certain conditions, including the \u201cfree-choice-of-provider\u201d provision added in 1967, which ensures Medicaid beneficiaries can obtain medical assistance from any qualified provider. States must submit their medical assistance plans to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for approval, and the Secretary can withhold funds if states fail to comply with federal requirements.\n\nIn South Carolina, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic operates two health centers providing various medical services, including contraception, cancer screenings, and STI treatment. Julie Edwards, a Medicaid beneficiary, received care at Planned Parenthood and planned to continue her gynecological care there. However, in July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Governor issued an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to terminate abortion clinics from the Medicaid program. As a result, DHHS informed Planned Parenthood that it was no longer qualified to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries and terminated its enrollment agreements immediately. Planned Parenthood and Edwards then sued the Director of DHHS in federal court, seeking to block enforcement of the executive order.\n\nThe district court initially granted a preliminary injunction blocking South Carolina from terminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid enrollment, and after multiple appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and one previous remand from the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit again held that Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce their right to choose their provider.",

It correctly identifies the central legal question (implied private right of action), places it within the correct jurisprudential context (the Court's skepticism), and formulates a highly effective, logical plan for information gathering (start with the petitioner's brief). \n\nTask EIG is high (0.8) because this plan dramatically reduces uncertainty about how to proceed. It focuses the investigation on the most critical documents and arguments, making subsequent searches far more efficient and targeted. While it doesn't provide new data itself, it creates a high-quality framework for acquiring that data, which is essential for an accurate prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because the articulated strategy is a textbook example of effective legal analysis for SCOTUS cases. The pattern of 'identify core legal issue -> recall/research Court's trend -> prioritize petitioner's brief' is a powerful, generalizable, and repeatable workflow for this entire class of problems.

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J. New, More Abortions, More Taxpayer \nDollars, and Fewer Health Services, National Review \n(Apr. 17, 2024), perma.cc/E89W-6WL9. \nPPSAT\u2019s two South Carolina locations offer only \ntwo prenatal/postpartum services: pregnancy tests \n(necessary for an abortion) and \u201cmiscarriage care\u201d \n(including treatments for women who intentionally \nterminate their pregnancies with abortion drugs).1 \nPPSAT does not deliver healthy babies or help women \nbecome pregnant, but the Columbia site does offer \nsubsidies for abortions it provides.2 And less than \nthree years before its Medicaid disqualification, \nPPSAT\u2019s Columbia site was threatened with closure \nfor \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know \nAct, incomplete medical and employee records, \nimproper infectious waste disposal practices, [and] \nfailure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in \n[a] timely manner, among other violations.\u201d3 \n \n1 Prenatal and Postpartum Services in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/H7J8-KK6J; Prenatal and Postpartum \nServices \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/TQY4-XDDT. \n2 Pregnancy Testing and Planning in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/YVH6-ZAH5; Pregnancy Testing and \nPlanning \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/AC5U-H5A6 (noting that the site refers out prenatal \ncare and adoption services); Abortion in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/C4Z9-75A5. \n3 Matthew Stevens,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n126: 20250203121028207_23-127520Proof20of20Service20for20Petitioner20Brief.json (score: 0.405)\nNo. 23-1275,\nINTHE\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nEUNICE MEDINA, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACTTY AS INTERIM DIRECTOR,\n\u2018SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\nPotitionor,\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ot a,\n\nRespondents.\n\u201cAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\nTHEREBY CERTIFY that all parties required to be served, have been served, on this\n3 day of February, 2025, in accordance with U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.3, three (3)\ncopies of the foregoing BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONER by placing said copies in\nFEDERAL EXPRESS, PRIORITY OVERNIGHT, postage prepaid, addressed as listed\nbelow.\n\nNicole Saharsky\n\n\u2018Mayer Brown LLP\n\n1999 K Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20006\n\n(202) 263-3052\nnsaharsky@mayerbrown.com\n\nWashington, DC 20086,\n(202) 347-8203\n\nDistrict of Columbia\nSigned and sworn to (or affirmed) before me on 3 day of February, 2025,\n\nPIERANGELI\n\u2018NOTARY PUBLIC, DISTRICT OF COLI\n\u2018My Commission Expires June 14, 2025,\n\n",

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J.

So a Medicaid beneficiary who \nvisits Waverly Women\u2019s Health for birth control will \nreceive care for her other medical issues, too.  \nConsider Respondent Julie Edwards\u2019s experience. \nShe has reported multiple serious health concerns, \nsuch as Type 1 diabetes (with complications), partial \nblindness, and nerve damage.

In \ncontrast, at Waverly Women\u2019s Health, she would have \nbeen offered birth control and in-network access to \nservices addressing her diabetes and other serious \nconditions. \nDisqualifying abortion providers like PPSAT \nensures that women receive comprehensive medical \ncare. It also ensures that South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nfunding goes toward improving \u201caccess to necessary \nmedical care and important women\u2019s health and \nfamily planning services\u201d for all women\u2014rather than \nimproving Planned Parenthood\u2019s ability to free up \nfunding to pay for abortions.

District court grants preliminary injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nThe district court granted Ms. Edwards\u2019s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction and, because that ruling \nresolved the issue, did not analyze PPSAT\u2019s right to \nthe same relief. Pet.App.127a, 146a. On the \u201cissue of \nwhether \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) creates a private right of \naction enforceable through \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court applied \nthe so-called Blessing factors\u2014named for Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997)\u2014and said that it does. \nPet.App.132a\u201336a. \n\n13 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed. In analyzing wheth-\ner \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to create an individual right \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision is \u201cunambiguous,\u201d Pet.App.83a, \nthat court also applied the Blessing factors, assessed \nwhether Congress had \u201cforeclosed a \u00a7 1983 remedy,\u201d \nand then joined the circuits that had found \u201c a private \nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Pet.App.95a\u2013102a. \nThe court cited\u2014but did not discuss\u2014the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s contrary holding in Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017). Pet.App.96a, 103a. \nConcurring, Judge Richardson wrote separately \nto call for clarity: \u201cWhat is the proper framework for \ndetermining whether a given statute creates a right \nthat is privately enforceable \u2026?\u201d Pet.App.121a. And \nmore specifically, has Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), \u201cbeen repudiated (or \neven effectively overruled)?\u201d Ibid. \nB. District court grants permanent injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nWhile a petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court granted summary judgment to Respond-\nents and directed them to submit a draft order \ngranting a permanent injunction. Pet.App.69a, 78a\u2013\n79a. Five days later, they filed a brief in this Court \narguing that the Court should deny the State\u2019s \npetition because it was about to become moot. Suppl. \nBr. for Resp\u2019ts, Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-1186). And the Court \nsubsequently denied the petition. Baker, 141 S. Ct. \n550 (2020). \n \n\n14 \n \nMeanwhile, the district court entered an order \npermanently enjoining Petitioner from \u201cterminating \nor excluding\u201d PPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram based on its abortion activities. Pet.App.67a. \nAnd Petitioner appealed to the Fourth Circuit again. \nOn appeal, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that \nthe en banc Fifth Circuit in Kauffman had recently \nheld that the any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create private rights, Pet.App.51a\u201352a, but the \nFourth Circuit still refused to \u201creconsider [its] \nprevious panel decision,\u201d Pet.App.51a. \nConcurring only in the judgment, Judge Richard-\nson wrote separately to implore this Court to clear up \nthe \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d in the caselaw. \nPet.App.65a. \u201cGonzaga arguably laid down a different \ntest than Wilder and Blessing,\u201d he explained. Ibid. \nBut until this Court plainly repudiates them, lower \ncourts \u201cremain[ ] bound by Blessing and Wilder.\u201d Ibid. \nThe State filed a second petition for certiorari. \nC. After a GVR, the Fourth Circuit affirms \nagain. \nTwo months later, the Court granted certiorari in \nTalevski. Its opinion reaffirmed that \u201cGonzaga sets \nforth [the Court\u2019s] established method for ascer-\ntaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private rights in \nthe Spending Clause context. Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. But the Court said nothing about the ongoing \nvalidity of Wilder or Blessing. The Court then GVR\u2019d \nthis case. Pet.App.37a. \n \n\n15 \n \nOn remand, the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its \nprior decisions. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. Talevski, the court \nwrote, \u201coffered an illuminating analysis\u201d and \u201ca useful \nnew example of provisions enforceable via \u00a7 1983,\u201d \nbut the court did \u201cnot read it as toppling the existing \ndoctrinal regime.\u201d Pet.App.4a. Wilder remained good \nlaw, and the court (wrongly) thought that it \u201cwould \nappear to doom the State\u2019s argument at the starting \ngate.\u201d Pet.App.27a\u201328a. Finally, while Talevski had \n\u201cshed some new light on Blessing,\u201d it was not the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s \u201cprerogative to proclaim a Supreme \nCourt precedent overthrown.\u201d Pet.App.21a\u201322a.  \nAgain concurring only in the judgment, Judge \nRichardson noted that he had written separately \ntwice before \u201cto ask for clarity on the precedential \nstatus of Wilder \u2026 and, to a lesser extent, Blessing.\u201d \nPet.App.35a. He did so for a third time \u201cbecause even \nafter [Talevski],\u201d lower courts still \u201clack the guidance \ninferior judges need.\u201d Pet.App.35a\u201336a. They \u201clack \nsufficiently clear signals to be sure [this] Court has \ndiscarded Wilder\u2019s holding (or Blessing\u2019s test).\u201d \nPet.App.36a n.2. So the court was \u201cbound to stand by \n[its] previous holding.\u201d Pet.App.36a. \nThis Court granted certiorari. \n \n \n\n16 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThis Court has set a high bar for finding that a \nSpending Clause statute confers a federal right enfor-\nceable under Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision doesn\u2019t clear it. Congress \nmust speak with a \u201cclear voice\u201d and an \u201cunambiguous \nintent to confer individual rights\u201d for such a provision \nto confer a private right. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 \n(cleaned up). Congress must use unambiguously clear \nrights-creating language. Congress did not use such \nlanguage in the any-qualified-provider provision; the \nprovision says nothing about rights at all. \nTo date, this Court has identified only four provi-\nsions with clear rights-creating language: the two \nresidents\u2019-rights provisions in Talevski and the two \n\u201cNo person shall\u201d provisions in Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972. Congress used such language \nin Talevski by labeling the benefits conferred there as \n\u201crights.\u201d And the \u201cNo person shall\u201d language in Titles \nVI and IX\u2014two civil-rights statutes\u2014closely mirrors \nthe text of the Fifth Amendment. \nIn contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision, \nwhich says only that \u201cany individual \u2026 may obtain\u201d \nassistance from any \u201cqualified\u201d provider, does not \nspeak about \u201crights\u201d or use clear rights-creating \nlanguage lifted from the Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. \nAbsent such language, the \u201ctypical remedy for state \nnoncompliance with federally imposed conditions is \nnot a private cause of action \u2026 but rather action by \nthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState.\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981). \n\n17 \n \nThis Court has carefully cabined prior opinions \nthat some lower courts have read to establish \u201ca \nrelatively loose standard for finding rights enforce-\nable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282. But while \nthe Court has abandoned the so-called Blessing \nfactors and limited Wilder and Wright v. City of \nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 \nU.S. 418 (1987), to their facts, the Court has not yet \nexpressly overruled them or explicitly said that it has \nabandoned them. And that has left lower courts won-\ndering if they\u2019re bound to apply them. This case is a \nchance to provide much-needed clarity: the Court \nshould reiterate that it has abandoned Blessing\u2019s \nmulti-factored test and limited Wright and Wilder to \nspecific facts not implicated here. The Court should \nthen apply Gonzaga and Talevski and reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create a private right.  \nA. Only clear rights-creating terms create a \nprivate right in spending laws. \nThe \u201clegitimacy\u201d of Congress\u2019s exercise of its \nspending power depends on a state\u2019s voluntary and \nknowing acceptance of terms. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at \n17. \u201cRespecting this limitation is critical to ensuring \nthat Spending Clause legislation does not undermine \nthe status of the States as independent sovereigns in \nour federal system.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., \nplurality). So \u201cif Congress intends to impose a con-\ndition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. \n\n18 \n \nAbiding by that \u201cwell-established requirement\u201d \nensures states receive the \u201cclear notice\u201d they deserve. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 180 n.8. And \u201c[b]y insisting that \nCongress speak with a clear voice,\u201d the Court enables \nstates to \u201cexercise their choice knowingly, cognizant \nof the consequences of their participation.\u201d Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17. \nThat clear-statement rule applies when a private \nparty claims an enforceable right based on a provision \nin a Spending Clause statute like the Medicaid Act. \n\u201c[U]nless Congress speaks with a clear voice and \nmanifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual \nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for \nprivate enforcement by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n280 (cleaned up). That makes sense because Section \n1983 creates a cause of action for \u201cthe deprivation of \nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\u201d \nfederal law. 42 U.S.C. 1983 (emphasis added). \nAt least since Gonzaga, this Court has been clear \nthat it will not \u201cpermit anything short of an unambig-\nuously conferred right to support a cause of action \nbrought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d 536 U.S. at 283. As the Court \nreiterated in Talevski, that is a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d and \na \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d 599 U.S. at 180, 184; accord id. \nat 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar is high, and \nalthough the FNHRA clears it, many federal statutes \nwill not.\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \nabout the \u201chigh bar\u201d). \n \n \n \n\n19 \n \nSection \u201c1983 actions are the exception\u2014not the \nrule\u2014for violations of Spending Clause statutes.\u201d Id. \nat 193\u201394 (Barrett, J., concurring). So the question is \n\u201cwhether this is the atypical case\u201d in which a \nSpending Clause provision \u201cunambiguously confer[s] \nindividual rights, making those rights presumptively \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 183 (emphasis \nadded) (cleaned up). It is not. \n\u201cGonzaga sets forth [the Court\u2019s] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Under that test, it\u2019s not \nenough that a \u201cplaintiff falls within the general zone \nof interest that the statute is intended to protect.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. Rather, a court must exam-\nine the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d and determine \nwhether a plaintiff has made the \u201ccritical\u201d showing \u201cof \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language.\u201d Id. at 286, 287 (emphasis \nadded) (citing Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n288\u201389 (2001), and Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. \n677, 690 n.13 (1979)). \nAnd if a provision does have clear rights-creating \nlanguage, a plaintiff still must show that such lan-\nguage is \u201cphrased in terms of the persons benefitted,\u201d \nwith \u201can unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287 (cleaned up); accord \nUniversities Rsch. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754, \n772 n.23 (1981) (quoting U.S. for Benefit & on Behalf \nof Glynn v. Capeletti Bros., 621 F.2d 1309, 1314 (5th \nCir. 1980)). That means \u201cthe Gonzaga test is satisfied \nwhere the provision in question [1] is phrased in \nterms of the persons benefitted\u201d \u201cwith an unmistak-\nable focus on the benefited class\u201d \u201cand [2] contains \nrights-creating, individual-centric language.\u201d Talev-\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 (emphasis added) (cleaned up). \n\n20 \n \nIn sum, the \u201cquestion is not simply who would \nbenefit from the Act, but whether Congress intended \nto confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 294 (1981). \nAnd \u201crights-creating language\u201d is \u201ccritical\u201d to that \nshowing. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287 (cleaned up). \nB. The \nany-qualified-provider \nprovision \nlacks clear rights-creating language. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision has nothing \napproaching the \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d that \nwould make this the \u201catypical case.\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183, 186 (cleaned up). The provision requires \nonly that state plans provide that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any institution, agency, community \npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service \nor services required \u2026 who undertakes to provide \u2026 \nsuch services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). \nFirst and foremost, the text never mentions the \nword \u201cright\u201d or its functional equivalent. Compare \nwith Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (residents\u2019 \u201cright to \nbe free from\u201d restraints; \u201ctransfer and discharge \nrights\u201d) (cleaned up). Nor is it framed using the \nrights-creating \u201cNo person shall\u201d language Congress \nborrowed from the Bill of Rights when it enacted the \ncivil-rights statutes contained in Titles VI and IX. \nViewed contextually, the provision also does not \n\u201creside in\u201d a part of the Medicaid Act that \u201cexpressly \nconcerns\u201d requirements \u201crelating to [beneficiaries\u2019] \nrights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (cleaned up). \nInstead, it resides in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, titled \u201cState \nplans for medical assistance,\u201d under subsection (a), \nwhich is simply titled \u201cContents.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \n\n21 \n \nThe provision also limits the scope of the benefit \nto \u201cqualified\u201d providers while later acknowledging the \nstates\u2019 authority to decide what makes a provider \nqualified. See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1) (\u201cIn addition to \nany other authority, a State may exclude any indi-\nvidual or entity for purposes of participating under \nthe State plan under this subchapter for any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity \u2026.\u201d) (emphasis added). Letting the regulated \nentity\u2014here the state\u2014decide the scope of the right \nwould be an odd way to bestow a right. For example, \nit would have made no sense for the Framers to \nqualify the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech Clause by \nallowing the regulated entity\u2014Congress\u2014to define \nwhat qualifies as \u201cspeech.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. I. Or \nfor Congress to qualify Title IX by allowing the \nregulated entities\u2014schools\u2014to define what counts as \n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). Or for Congress \nin FNHRA to allow nursing homes to decide what \ncounts as \u201crestraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nTrue rights-creating language doesn\u2019t work that way. \nWhat\u2019s more, the provision speaks of \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d \na benefit from a third party. But that\u2019s quite unlike \nclear rights-creating language, which confers a right \ndirectly and in explicit terms. For example, FNHRA \ndid not say that any resident in a covered nursing \nhome \u201cmay obtain\u201d an environment free of physical or \nchemical restraints. Nor did it say that any resident \n\u201cmay obtain\u201d advance notice of a transfer or dis-\ncharge. Likewise, Congress did not write Title IX to \nsay any citizen \u201cmay obtain\u201d the benefits of a federally \nfunded education program free of sex discrimination. \nWhen Congress wants to create a private right, it \nconfers that right expressly and directly. \n\n22 \n \nTellingly, in enacting Section 1396a, Congress \nspecifically did invoke the words \u201cright\u201d and \u201crights\u201d \nin several places\u2014five times in the context of pay-\nments and a few more in the context of whistle-\nblowers, notifications about the right to accept or \nrefuse treatment, and the disregard of certain \nproperty in determining the eligibility of Indians. 42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(25)(H)\u2013(I), \n(a)(45), \n(a)(68)(C), \n(w)(1)(A), (ff)(3)\u2013(4). The only other mentions of \n\u201crights\u201d in Section 1396a are when Congress is discus-\nsing administrative appeals, both for individuals, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(ee)(4), and for providers, 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(kk)(8)(B). \nCongress chose not to mention rights when direct-\ning participating states to include the any-qualified-\nprovider provision in their plans. So at best, Respon-\ndents have to infer that Congress created a private \nright. And \u201can inference is not \u2018an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u201d Kauffman, 981 F.3d at 360 (quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283); accord 31 Foster Child. v. \nBush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1270 (11th Cir. 2003) \n(\u201cAmbiguity precludes enforceable rights.\u201d). \nOn its plain text, then, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision, like many statutes, may confer a benefit. \nAnd Ms. Edwards may even be within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. But that\u2019s not enough to unambigu-\nously confer a private right. The provision\u2019s text and \nstructure are devoid of any language resembling what \nthis Court has deemed clear rights-creating language. \nGonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 \n(citing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280), requires far more. \n\n23 \n \nC. The Court should retain its bright lines \nabout what qualifies as clear rights-\ncreating language. \nThus far, this Court has limited \u201cclear rights-\ncreating language\u201d to statutes where Congress \nexplicitly uses the label \u201cright\u201d or lifts language from \nthe rights-creating provisions of the Constitution. To \nkeep Gonzaga\u2019s bar \u201cdemanding,\u201d the Court should \nhold that line. The any-qualified-provider provision \nfalls far short, as this Court\u2019s precedents prove.  \n1. Talevski proves Congress can clearly \nconfer a private right by explicitly \nlabeling a benefit a \u201cright.\u201d  \nIn Talevski, this Court held that two provisions of \nFNHRA that explicitly reference \u201crights of nursing- \nhome residents to be free from unnecessary\u201d \nrestraints and to receive pre-discharge notice \u201cunam-\nbiguously create \u00a7 1983-enforceable rights.\u201d 599 U.S. \nat 171\u201372 (emphasis added). The provisions satisfied \n\u201cGonzaga\u2019s stringent standard\u201d given their \u201cclear \nrights-creating language.\u201d Id. at 186 (cleaned up). \n\u201cTo start, \u2026 both [the unnecessary-restraint and \npredischarge-notice provision] reside in 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1396r(c), which expressly concerns \u2018[r]equirements \nrelating to residents\u2019 rights.\u2019\u201d Id. at 184 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c)). As this Court explained it, \u201c[t]his \nframing is indicative of an individual \u2018rights-creating\u2019 \nfocus.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \n\u201cExamined further,\u201d the provisions\u2019 text \u201cunambig-\nuously confers rights upon the residents of nursing-\nhome facilities.\u201d Ibid. \n\n24 \n \nThe unnecessary-restraint provision appears in a \nstatutory subsection called \u201cGeneral rights\u201d and in a \nsubsubsection titled \u201cSpecified rights.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). That provision \nrequires nursing homes to \u201cprotect and promote\u201d the \nrights of each resident, including \u201c[t]he right to be free \nfrom \u2026 any physical or chemical restraints \u2026 not \nrequired to treat the resident\u2019s medical symptoms.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii)). The provision sits alongside addi-\ntional provisions that protect \u201c[t]he right to choose a \npersonal attending physician\u201d (more on this in a \nmoment), \u201c[t]he right to privacy,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to \nconfidentiality,\u201d the \u201cright \u2026 to reside and receive \nservices with reasonable accommodation of individual \nneeds,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \u2026 to receive notice before the \nroom or roommate of the resident in the facility is \nchanged,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to voice grievances,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \nof the resident to organize and participate in resident \ngroups,\u201d \u201cthe right of the resident\u2019s family to meet in \nthe facility,\u201d \u201c[t]he right of the resident to participate \nin social, religious, and community activities,\u201d \u201c[t]he \nright to examine\u201d facility survey results, \u201c[t]he right \nto refuse a transfer to another room,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny other \nright established by the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(i), (iii)-(xi) (emphasis added). FNHRA \nrefers to these as \u201clegal rights.\u201d Id. at (c)(1)(B)(i), (iv). \nThe \u201cpredischarge-notice provision is more of the \nsame.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. \u201cNestled in a para-\ngraph concerning \u2018transfer and discharge rights,\u2019 that \nprovision tells nursing facilities that they \u2018must not \ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\u2019 unless certain \npreconditions are met, including advance notice \u2026 to \nthe resident and his or her family.\u201d Id. at 184\u201385 \n\n25 \n \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)) (cleaned up); accord id. \nat 192 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he text of the \nAct\u2019s operative provisions refers to individual \n\u2018rights.\u2019\u201d). And before effecting a transfer or discharge, \nFNHRA requires the nursing home to provide a notice \nthat must include \u201cnotice of the resident\u2019s right to \nappeal the transfer or discharge.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(2)(B)(i), (iii). \nAs a result, \u201cthe text of the unnecessary-restraint \nand predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously \nconfer[ ] rights upon the residents.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 184. Those provisions \u201cstand in stark contrast to \nthe statutory provisions that failed Gonzaga\u2019s test in \nGonzaga itself.\u201d Id. at 185.  \nConversely, the any-qualified-provider provision \nnever mentions the word \u201cright\u201d or its equivalent. To \nbe sure, the phrase \u201cmay obtain \u2026 assistance\u201d might \nconfer a benefit. But that is not enough under Talev-\nski and Gonzaga. \u201c[I]t is rights, not the broader or \nvaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018interests,\u2019 that may be enforced\u201d \nunder Section 1983. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. \nDriving that point home, FNHRA proves that \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage in a Spending Clause provision when it wants \nto confer the right to choose a healthcare provider. As \nnoted above, in the same subsection that this Court \nanalyzed in Talevski\u2014\u201cRequirements relating to \nresidents\u2019 rights\u201d\u2014Congress required that a \u201cnursing \nfacility must protect and promote the rights of each \nresident, including\u201d the \u201cright[ ]\u201d of \u201cFree choice,\u201d \nstarting with the \u201cright to choose a personal attending \nphysician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis \nadded). \n\n26 \n \nThe text and structure of the any-qualified-\nprovider provision contain no such rights-creating \nlanguage. And Congress\u2019s \u201cuse of explicit language in \nother statutes cautions against inferring\u201d Congress \nintended to say something it didn\u2019t say in the statute \nunder consideration. Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 \nU.S. 371, 384 (2013). If that\u2019s true where \u201cexplicit \nlanguage\u201d is not required, ibid., then in a context like \nthis one, where explicit rights-creating language is \nrequired, the absence of that language\u2014coupled with \nits presence in statutes like FNHRA\u2014is dispositive. \nSee Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 (\u201cWe therefore begin \n(and find that we can end) our search for Congress\u2019s \nintent with the text and structure of Title VI.\u201d). \n2. Titles VI and IX prove Congress can \nclearly confer a private right by \nusing text from the rights-creating \nprovisions of the U.S. Constitution. \nThe two rights-creating provisions this Court \nidentified in Gonzaga\u2014Title VI and Title IX\u2014confirm \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage. As Gonzaga recognized, both contain \u201cexplicit\u201d \nrights-creating terms. 536 U.S. at 284 n.3. \u201cTitle VI \nprovides: \u2018No person in the United States shall ... be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance\u2019 on the \nbasis of race, color, or national origin.\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 2000d) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). And \n\u201cTitle IX provides: \u2018No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, ... be subjected to dis-\ncrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1681(a)) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). \n\n27 \n \nThis Court\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cNo \nperson shall,\u201d located in two civil-rights statutes, \nqualifies as clear rights-creating language follows \nnaturally from the phrase\u2019s deeply rooted, rights-\ncreating pedigree. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Bill of \nRights and analogous provisions in nearly all the \nstates\u2019 constitutions have included that phrase for \ncenturies. See U.S. Const. amend. V (\u201cNo person shall \n\u2026\u201d); John T. McNaughton, The Privilege against Self-\nIncrimination, 51 J. Crim. L. Criminology & Police \nSci. 138, 139 (1960) (noting that \u201cthe constitutions of \nall but two states\u201d contain verbatim \u201cNo person shall\u201d \nlanguage or its equivalent).  \nBy contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision \ncontains no such clear rights-creating language. \nAlthough the court below thought the phrase \u201cany \nindividual\u201d \u201cclosely mirrors\u201d the \u201cNo person \u2026 shall\u201d \nphrasing highlighted in Gonzaga, Pet.App.57a, that \nconclusion is fatally flawed.  \nCongress could have drawn on the rights-creating \npedigree of the phrase \u201cNo person shall\u201d and required \nstate plans to provide that \u201cno person shall be denied \nthe free choice of any provider qualified to perform the \nrequired services.\u201d But Congress did not write that. \nInstead, it used \u201cmay\u201d in place of the more traditional \nrights-creating \u201cshall,\u201d it limited the scope of the class \nto \u201celigible\u201d individuals, it gave states authority to \ndecide what makes a provider \u201cqualified,\u201d and it spoke \nof \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d a benefit from a third party. \nDespite all this, Respondents have argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision should be read as \nthough it were written like Titles VI and IX, but this \nCourt usually does not \u201cread into statutes words that \n\n28 \n \naren\u2019t there.\u201d Romag Fasteners, Inc v. Fossil, Inc., 590 \nU.S. 212, 215 (2020). Accord Morse v. Republican \nParty of Va., 517 U.S. 186, 286\u201388 (1996) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Scalia, J., and \nin relevant part, Kennedy, J.) (concluding, pre-\nGonzaga, that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \ncontained a private right of action but Section 10 did \nnot because only the former used the familiar \u201cno \nperson shall\u201d term of art). \nNor can Respondents transform the any-\nqualified-provider provision into a \u201cfree-choice-of-\nprovider provision\u201d simply by attaching that label to \nit. Contra Opp.i (adopting this label and inserting it \ninto the first question presented). The provision\u2019s text \ndoes not contain the phrase \u201cfree choice,\u201d much less \nthe clear rights-creating language in Titles VI and IX. \nStretching the text, Respondents try to \u201cconjure up a \nprivate [right] that has not been authorized by \nCongress.\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291. But the \nabsence of \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d calls the \nCourt to reject that effort. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186. \n3. Absent such explicit rights-creating \nlanguage, spending statutes do not \ncreate private rights, as this Court\u2019s \nprecedents prove.  \nIn Gonzaga, a student sued his private university \nunder Section 1983 to enforce provisions in FERPA \n\u201cprohibit[ing] the federal funding of educational insti-\ntutions that [had] a policy or practice of releasing \neducation records to unauthorized persons.\u201d Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 276. One provision stated: \n\n29 \n \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein \u2026) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). \nA second added that \u201c[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u201d to educational entities with \u201ca policy or \npractice of releasing, or providing access to, [certain] \npersonally identifiable information \u2026 unless\u2014there is \nwritten consent from the student\u2019s parents \u2026 with a \ncopy of the records to be released to the student\u2019s \nparents and the student if desired by the parents\u201d or a \ncourt order approving the release.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(b)(2) (emphasis added). \nThe \nGonzaga \ndissent \nthought \nthe \nsecond \nprovision \u201cplainly [met] the standards\u201d this Court \n\u201carticulated in Blessing for establishing a federal \nright.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 295 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning). It was \u201cdirected to the benefit of individual \nstudents and parents,\u201d it was \u201cbinding on States,\u201d it \nwas \u201ccouched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms,\u201d it was \u201cfar from vague and amorphous,\u201d and \nit spoke \u201cof the individual \u2018student,\u2019 not students \ngenerally.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The dissent also high-\nlighted the \u201crights-creating language in the title\u201d of \nFERPA\u2014the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct\u2014the \u201ctext of the Act,\u201d and its \u201coverall context.\u201d Id. \nat 293, 296. \n\n30 \n \nDespite all that, this Court held it was not \nenough. The provisions \u201clack[ed] the sort of \u2018rights-\ncreating\u2019 language critical to showing the requisite \ncongressional intent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. \nInstead, the Act spoke \u201conly to the Secretary of \nEducation, directing that \u2018[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u2019 to any \u2018educational agency or institution\u2019\u201d \nwith \u201ca prohibited \u2018policy or practice.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). And that made the Act\u2019s \u201cfocus \n\u2026 two steps removed from the interests of individual \nstudents and parents.\u201d Ibid. \nRespondents\u2019 arguments here sound like the Gon-\nzaga dissent. Though the any-qualified-provider \nprovision is a directive and uses the word \u201cindivid-\nual,\u201d the text lacks \u201c\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language,\u201d and \nspeaks only to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. \nCompare \nibid. \nThat \nmakes \nSection \n1395a(a)(23) two steps removed from the interests of \nbeneficiaries. Ibid. \n\u201cThe Court consistently has found that Congress \nintended to create a cause of action \u2018where the \nlanguage of the statute explicitly confers a right \ndirectly on a class of persons that includes the \nplaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & \nSmith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 391 n.91 (1982) \n(emphasis added) (cleaned up) (quoting Cannon, 441 \nU.S. at 690 n.13). Conversely, it has noted that there \n\u201cwould be far less reason to infer a private remedy in \nfavor of individual persons\u201d where Congress, rather \nthan drafting the legislation \u201cwith an unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class,\u201d has framed the statute \nsimply as a general prohibition or a command to a \nfederal agency. Coutu, 450 U.S. at 771\u201373 (citing \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392 & n.13). \n\n31 \n \nSimilarly, in Coutu, the Court addressed the \nprivate enforceability of minimum-wage provisions in \nthe Davis-Bacon Act that are analogous to the any-\nqualified-provider provision. 450 U.S. at 756\u201357. The \nlead provisions there required that advertised specifi-\ncations for certain federal construction contracts \n\u201cshall contain a provision stating the minimum wages \nto be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics \nwhich shall be based\u201d on the prevailing rates for lab-\norers and mechanics working on similar projects. Id. \nat 756\u201357 (quoting what are now located at 40 U.S.C. \n3142(a) and (b)) (emphasis added). A separate pro-\nvision added that \u201c[e]very contract based upon these \nspecifications must contain a stipulation that the \ncontractor shall pay wages not less than those stated \nin the specifications.\u201d Id. at 757 (emphasis added) \n(describing what is now located at 40 U.S.C. 3142(c)). \nThis Court had previously \u201crecognized that on its \nface, the Act is a minimum wage law designed for the \nbenefit of construction workers.\u201d Id. at 771 (cleaned \nup). But that \u201cdesign[ ]\u201d did \u201cnot end the inquiry.\u201d \nIbid. Instead, the Court asked \u201cwhether the language \nof the statute indicates that Congress intended that it \nbe enforced through private litigation.\u201d Ibid. That \nintent exists only \u201c\u2018where the language of the statute \nexplicitly confer[s] a right directly on a class of persons \nthat include[s] the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at 772 (emphasis \nadded) (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \n\u201cConversely,\u201d no private cause of action arises \nwhen Congress \u201cframe[s] the statute simply as a gen-\neral prohibition or a command to a federal agency.\u201d \nIbid. (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392). And \nthat\u2019s what Congress did in \u201cSection 1 of the Davis-\nBacon Act,\u201d which required \u201ccertain stipulations be \n\n32 \n \nplaced in federal construction contracts for the benefit \nof mechanics and laborers, but [did] not confer rights \ndirectly on those individuals.\u201d Ibid. Given that \nomission, the Act\u2019s language \u201cprovide[d] no support \nfor the implication of a private remedy.\u201d Id. at 773. \nSo too here. Congress directed the Secretary to \n\u201capprove any plan which fulfills the conditions\u201d in \n1396a(a), including that a \u201cState plan for medical \nassistance must \u2026 provide that \u2026 any individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any \u2026 qualified\u201d provider. 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(b), (a)(23). That condition may have been \n\u201cdesigned to benefit a particular class,\u201d like the Davis-\nBacon Act was designed to benefit mechanics and \nlaborers, but that \u201cdoes not end the inquiry.\u201d Coutu, \n450 U.S. at 771. It also may have been stated as a \nmandatory component, like the Davis-Bacon Act was. \nId. at 757 (describing stipulations that contracts \n\u201cmust contain\u201d). But as Coutu proves, that is not \nenough to create a privately enforceable right where, \nas here, a statute is framed \u201csimply as \u2026 a command \nto a federal agency\u201d and does not \u201c\u2018explicitly confer[ ] \na right directly on a class of persons that include[s] \nthe plaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Id. at 772 (quoting Cannon, \n441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \nUltimately, the question is \u201cone of congressional \nintent, not one of whether this Court thinks it can \nimprove upon the statutory scheme that Congress \nenacted into law.\u201d Id. at 770 (cleaned up). As for the \nany-qualified-provider provision\u2019s text, Congress\u2019s \nintent is clear: The \u201crights-creating language so \ncritical to the Court\u2019s analysis\u201d in its cases \u201cis \ncompletely absent\u201d here. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 \n(cleaned up). And that ends the analysis. Ibid. \n\n33 \n \nD. The Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory \nregime reinforces that the any-qualified-\nprovider provision does not create \nprivate rights. \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory scheme \nconfirms what the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext has already shown\u2014that the provision does not \ncreate privately enforceable rights. \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute that \nimposes duties and restraints on states. It is merely a \nfunding mechanism, and state \u201cparticipation in the \nMedicaid program is entirely optional.\u201d Harris v. \nMcRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980). States that choose \nto participate in Medicaid may also choose to change \ntheir programs, even if doing so creates the possibility \nthat the Secretary will deny funding. 42 U.S.C. 1396c; \n42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \nThe Act\u2019s baseline requirement for states is \nproviding coverage to \u201ccategorically needy\u201d groups for \nsome basic services. Barbara S. Klees et al., Ctrs. for \nMedicare & Medicaid Servs., Brief Summaries of \nMedicare & Medicaid: Title XVIII & Title XIX of The \nSocial Securities Act 22\u201326 (Dec. 31, 2012). Beyond \nthat, states can choose how they want to structure \ntheir programs when it comes to eligibility standards, \nscope of coverage, payment methodology, and the like. \nId. at 22\u201328. The Secretary alone decides if a state \nhas satisfied the Act\u2019s requirements and, if the state \nlater falls out of compliance in administering its plan, \nwhether to withhold some or all of the state\u2019s funding. \n42 U.S.C. 1396c; 42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \n \n\n34 \n \nPut differently, the Act imposes a legally binding \ndirective only on the Secretary, who is charged with \napproving plans and ensuring states substantially \ncomply with the Act\u2019s plan requirements to continue \nreceiving funds. 42 U.S.C. 1396c. Absent a Talevski-\nlike bill of rights, \u201c[f]ocusing on substantial compli-\nance is tantamount to focusing on the aggregate \npractices of a state funding recipient.\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare & Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, \n1201 (8th Cir. 2013). \nLike the FERPA provisions in Gonzaga, then, \nSection 1396a and the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion are \u201cprimarily directed [at] the Federal Govern-\nment\u2019s \u2018distribution of public funds,\u2019 [with] \u2018an \naggregate, not individual, focus.\u2019\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 185\u201386 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290). The \nSecretary must look at the aggregate of more than 80 \ndisparate plan requirements and assess a state\u2019s sub-\nstantial compliance. \u201cEven where a subsidiary provi-\nsion includes mandatory language that ultimately \nbenefits individuals, a statute phrased as a directive \nto a federal agency typically does not confer enforce-\nable federal rights on the individuals.\u201d Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d at 1041 (citing Coutu, 450 U.S. at 756 n.1). \nJust as the Medicaid Act charges the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services with dealing with state \nviolations, Congress in FERPA explicitly authorized \nthe Secretary of Education to \u201cdeal with violations\u201d of \nthat Act. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(f)). And there was \u201cno question that FERPA\u2019s \nnondisclosure provisions fail[ed] to confer enforceable \nrights.\u201d Id. at 287. There is likewise no question that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision fails to confer an \nenforceable right here. \n\n35 \n \nThe plurality\u2019s analysis in Armstrong bolsters \nthat conclusion. 575 U.S. at 331\u201332 (Scalia, J., joined \nby Roberts, C.J., Thomas, J., and Alito, J.). Its opinion \nanalyzed 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)\u2014a subsection of the \nMedicaid Act parallel to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision\u2014and noted that it is \u201cphrased as a directive \nto the federal agency charged with approving state \nMedicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue \nupon the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s decision to partic-\nipate in Medicaid.\u201d Id. at 331. \u201c[S]uch language re-\nveals no congressional intent to create a private right \nof action.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The same is true here. \nIn this case, the Fourth Circuit placed great \nweight on 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 in dismissing any \nrelevance of the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \nappearance in a statute \u201crequiring a State plan or \nspecifying the required contents of a State plan.\u201d \nPet.App.29a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2). But as the \nEighth Circuit has explained, Section 1320a-2 simply \nmeans that a provision \u201ccannot be deemed indivi-\ndually unenforceable solely because of its situs in a \nlarger regime \u2018requiring a State plan or specifying the \nrequired contents of a state plan.\u2019\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare, 712 F.3d at 1200 (emphasis added). And \u201cwhen \na statute links funding to substantial compliance with \nits conditions\u2014including forming and adhering to a \nstate plan with specified features\u2014this [link] \ncounsels against the creation of individually enforce-\nable rights.\u201d Ibid. That\u2019s \u201cbecause, even where a state \nsubstantially complies with its federal responsibili-\nties, a sizeable minority of its beneficiaries may none-\ntheless fail to receive the full panoply of offered \nbenefits.\u201d Id. at 1200\u201301. True rights-creating provi-\nsions require more than this. \n\n36 \n \nTellingly, the Armstrong plurality did not think \nSection 1320a-2 foreclosed its consideration of this \ncritical statutory context. See Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n376 (Elrod, J., concurring, joined by six other judges) \n(explaining that Section 1320a-2 \u201cdid not inform the \nanalysis\u201d in Armstrong). Neither should this Court.  \nStanding alone, the Medicaid Act\u2019s substantial \ncompliance regime, its directive to the Secretary, or \nits articulation of dozens of plan requirements might \nnot be enough to foreclose private enforceability. See \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 328 (making that point \nregarding the Secretary\u2019s ability to withhold funds). \nBut taken together, they confirm what the text \nestablishes\u2014that Congress chose not to confer a \nprivately enforceable right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \nE. Common sense confirms what text and \nstructure prove. \n1. Respondents\u2019 approach would drop \nTalevski\u2019s high bar to the floor.  \nIn their opposition brief, Respondents argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision \u201chas an \u2018unmis-\ntakable focus\u2019 on the benefited class and is \u2018phrased in \nterms of the persons benefited,\u2019\u201d which, Respondents \nclaimed, \u201c\u2018satisfie[s]\u2019 this Court\u2019s test for whether a \nstatute contains the necessary rights-creating lan-\nguage.\u201d Opp.16 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). \nSuch a reading of Talevski would drop Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cde-\nmanding bar\u201d to the floor. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180. \n \n\n37 \n \nA statute that \u201caddresses,\u201d Opp.16, a benefited \nclass still must contain clear rights-creating language \nto confer privately enforceable rights. Per Gonzaga, \n\u201crights-creating\u201d language is \u201ccritical to showing the \nrequisite congressional intent to create new rights.\u201d \n536 U.S. at 287 (emphasis added); accord Sandoval, \n532 U.S. at 288 (same). Focus on a benefited class is \nnecessary\u2014but not sufficient. \nConsider the implications of finding privately \nenforceable rights simply because a statute \u201cadd-\nresses whether \u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients \u2018may \nobtain\u2019\u201d a benefit. Opp.16. Leaving aside that Section \n1396a(a) uses the word \u201cindividual\u201d hundreds of \ntimes, eight of the 87 listed plan-requirement provi-\nsions contain individual-focused, benefit-conferring \nlanguage that likely would satisfy Respondents\u2019 lax \ntest. Those provisions say that a \u201cState plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d do the following: \n(3)  \u201cprovide for granting an opportunity for a fair \nhearing before the State agency to any \nindividual \nwhose \nclaim \nfor \nmedical \nassistance under the plan is denied or is not \nacted upon with reasonable promptness,\u201d \n1396a(a)(3) (emphasis added); \n(8)  \u201cprovide that all individuals wishing to make \napplication for medical assistance under the \nplan shall have opportunity to do so, and that \nsuch assistance shall be furnished with \nreasonable \npromptness \nto \nall \neligible \nindividuals,\u201d 1396a(a)(8) (emphasis added); \n \n\n38 \n \n(10) \u201cprovide\u2014(B) that the medical assistance \nmade available to any individual described \nin subparagraph (A)\u2014(i) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to any other such \nindividual, and (ii) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to individuals not \ndescribed \nin \nsubparagraph \n(A),\u201d \n1396a(a)(10)(B) (emphasis added); \n       \u201cprovide\u2014(D) for the inclusion of home health \nservices for any individual who, under the \nState plan, is entitled to nursing facility \nservices,\u201d 1396a(a)(10)(D) (emphasis added); \n(12) \u201cprovide that, in determining whether an \nindividual is blind, there shall be an \nexamination by a physician skilled in the \ndiseases of the eye or by an optometrist, \nwhichever \nthe \nindividual \nmay \nselect,\u201d \n1396a(a)(12) (emphasis added); \n(32) \u201cprovide that no payment under the plan for \nany care or service provided to an individual \nshall be made to anyone other than such \nindividual or the person or institution \nproviding such care or service,\u201d barring \ncertain exceptions, 1396a(a)(32) (emphasis \nadded); \n(34) \u201cprovide that in the case of any individual \nwho has been determined to be eligible for \nmedical assistance under the plan, such \nassistance will be made available to him for \ncare and services included under the plan \nand furnished in or after the third month \n\n39 \n \nbefore the month in which he made \napplication (or application was made on his \nbehalf in the case of a deceased individual) \nfor such assistance if such individual was (or \nupon application would have been) eligible \nfor such assistance at the time such care and \nservices \nwere \nfurnished,\u201d \n1396a(a)(34) \n(emphasis added); \n(53) \u201cprovide\u2014(A) for notifying in a timely \nmanner all individuals in the State who are \ndetermined to be eligible for medical \nassistance and who are pregnant women, \nbreastfeeding or postpartum women \u2026, or \nchildren below the age of 5, of the availability \nof benefits furnished by the special supple-\nmental \nnutrition \nprogram \nunder \nsuch \nsection,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(A) (emphasis added); \nand \n        \u201c(B) for referring any such individual to the \nState agency responsible for administering \nsuch program,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(B) (emphasis \nadded); \n(84) \u201cprovide that\u2014(A) the State shall not \nterminate eligibility for medical assistance \nunder the State plan \u2026 for an individual who \nis an eligible juvenile \u2026 because the juvenile \nis an inmate of a public institution \u2026,\u201d \n1396a(a)(84)(A) (emphasis added); \n        \u201c(B) in the case of an individual who is an \neligible juvenile \u2026, the State shall, prior to \nthe individual\u2019s release from such a public \ninstitution, conduct a redetermination of \neligibility for such individual with respect to \n\n40 \n \nsuch medical assistance \u2026 and, if the State \ndetermines \u2026 that the individual continues \nto meet the eligibility requirements for such \nmedical assistance, the State shall restore \ncoverage for such medical assistance to such \nan individual upon the individual\u2019s release \nfrom such public institution,\u201d 1396a(a)(84)(B) \n(emphasis added).4 \nEach of these requirements \u201caddresses whether \n\u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients,\u201d Opp.16, \u201cshall\u201d or \n\u201cwill\u201d be given various types of medical assistance, \nproviders, or processes to ensure timely and equal \naccess to that assistance. Given Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemand-\ning bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180, it can\u2019t be true that \nall of them create privately enforceable rights. If it \nwere, then Talevski was hardly the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. \nat 183, and lower courts are free to \u201cfind\u201d private \nrights in innumerable federal statutory provisions. \nWorse, accepting Respondents\u2019 position that a \nprovision\u2019s \u201c\u2018unmistakable focus\u2019 on the benefited \nclass\u201d and its \u201c\u2018phras[ing] in terms of the persons \nbenefited\u2019\u201d is enough to create a private right, Opp.16 \n(cleaned up), would require overruling Suter v. Artist \nM., in its entirety. 503 U.S. 347 (1992). That is exactly \nwhat Congress insisted it was not doing when it \npassed Section 1320a-2. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 (providing \n\u201cthat this section is not intended to alter the holding \nin Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this \ntitle is not enforceable in a private right of action\u201d). \n \n4 Accord 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84)(C), (D) (requiring similar pro-\ncessing of applications for medical assistance submitted by \u201can \nindividual who is an eligible juvenile\u201d described in separate \nsubsections). \n\n41 \n \nThe Adoption Act plan-requirement provision in \nSuter required states to specify that, \u201cin each case, \nreasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the \nplacement of a child in foster care, to prevent or \neliminate the need for removal of the child from his \nhome, and (B) to make it possible for the child to \nreturn to his home.\u201d Suter, 503 U.S. at 351 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 671(a)(15)) (emphasis added). And yet, the \nCourt held that provision did not \u201cconfer[ ] an enforce-\nable private right on its beneficiaries\u201d even though it \nconferred a benefit and identified the benefited \nindividuals (\u201ca child\u201d and \u201cthe child\u201d in foster care). \nId. at 364. A \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement\u2014like a \nstate\u2019s substantial-compliance requirement to allow \nMedicaid recipients to choose a qualified provider\u2014\n\u201cis at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather \ngeneralized duty on the State, to be enforced not by \nprivate individuals, but by the Secretary.\u201d Id. at 363. \nIn recent decades, this Court has reined in the \n\u201cready implication\u201d of privately enforceable rights. \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. It should not return \nto \u201cthe heady days in which [it] assumed common-law \npowers to create causes of action.\u201d Corr. Servs. Corp. \nv. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 75 (2001) (Scalia J., \nconcurring). Accepting that invitation would subject \nstates to countless suits under a myriad of federal \nstatutes\u2014all without congressional approval. \n2. Finding a private right in the any-\nqualified-provider provision creates \ncontradictions and problems.  \nAdditional practical reasons weigh strongly \nagainst finding a private right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \n\n42 \n \nFirst, Respondents\u2019 position steals the discretion \nthat Congress vested in the Secretary through the \nsubstantial-compliance statute. Under the Medicaid \nAct, the Secretary is charged with interpretation and \nenforcement, including deciding whether a state\u2019s \nadministration of its plan is substantially compliant \nin its treatment of \u201cqualified\u201d providers. Yet under \nRespondents\u2019 theory, that administrative discretion is \nreassigned to federal district courts across the \ncountry issuing injunctions in Section 1983 actions.  \nSecond, a provider has a remedy for exclusion. It \ncan file an administrative appeal followed by state-\ncourt review and, if necessary, review by this Court. \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. 1002.213; S.C. \nCode Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154; S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 1-23-380. Providers may balk at having to \npursue an administrative remedy. But no one is \ncontending that state-court review followed by a \npetition for certiorari is an inadequate backstop. \nWhat\u2019s more, to suggest that Congress also \nintended beneficiaries to have a simultaneous right to \nsue in federal court to challenge such a decision is, to \nsay the least, \u201ca curious system for review of a State\u2019s \ndetermination that a Medicaid provider is not \n\u2018qualified.\u2019\u201d Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041\u201342. And \nbecause there\u2019s no reason that a judicial affirmance of \na disqualification decision would have preclusive ef-\nfect on a beneficiary\u2019s federal claim, this \u201cgives \u2026 \nfurther reason to doubt that Congress \u2026 unambigu-\nously created an enforceable federal right\u201d here. Ibid. \nRelatedly, it makes sense to infer a private right \nin the FNHRA context, where the resident and his \nnursing home may have adverse interests. See \n\n43 \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 172\u201374. It makes far less sense \nhere, where the beneficiary is protected by the \nprovider\u2019s exercise of its appeal rights. That may \nexplain why FNHRA has a savings clause, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(h)(8), while Section 1396a does not. \nThird, a ruling for Respondents would clash with \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s requirement that a state plan \n\u201cprovide \u2026 an opportunity for a fair hearing before \nthe State agency to any individual whose claim for \nmedical assistance under the plan is denied.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(3). It would be strange for Congress \nto create an express administrative remedy for bene-\nficiaries to challenge their own eligibility while \nauthorizing those beneficiaries sub silentio to go to \nfederal court to challenge a provider\u2019s eligibility.  \nFourth, Respondents say that Medicaid benefi-\nciaries need a private right of action to preserve broad \naccess to healthcare. But nothing is further from the \ntruth. South Carolinians in the Medicaid program \nhave access to plenty of providers. See supra, pp. 9\u2013\n11. And any excluded providers have an administra-\ntive remedy and judicial review to preserve their par-\nticipation in the program.  \nFinally, accepting Respondents\u2019 position would \nsubject states to innumerable lawsuits and accom-\npanying attorney-fee awards\u2014all without the clear \nnotice that the Spending Clause requires. And that \nproblem is not limited to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision. Lower courts that fail to follow this Court\u2019s \nguidance have found a vast array of private rights \nenforceable under Section 1983. \n \n\n44 \n \nLimiting the survey just to 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a), \nthese lawsuits have included healthcare providers \nchallenging a state\u2019s notice-and-comment process for \nsetting payment rates, e.g., BT Bourbonnais Care, \nLLC v. Norwood, 866 F.3d 815, 824 (7th Cir. 2017) \n(applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A)); individuals \ncontesting how promptly they received medical \nassistance, e.g., Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 355\u201357 \n(4th Cir. 2007) (applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(8)); and \nbeneficiaries challenging eligibility decisions, e.g., \nBontrager v. Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin., 697 \nF.3d 604, 606\u201307 (7th Cir. 2012) (applying 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(10)). The cost of these federal lawsuits is not \neasily quantified. But there is no doubt that such \nlawsuits will drain state Medicaid coffers at the \nexpense of needy families and children\u2014harming the \nvery people the Medicaid Act is supposed to help. \nIn sum, the any-qualified-provider provision lacks \nthe kind of unambiguous rights-creating language \nthat this Court demands to recognize a private right \nenforceable by Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s \nstructure counsels strongly against recognizing a \nprivate right. And the practical ramifications of \nfinding a private right in Section 1396a(a)(23) are so \ndisconcerting and irrational that the Court should not \nimpute them to Congress. \n \n \n\n45 \n \nII. The Court need not overrule any cases, but \nit should clarify that it has abandoned Bless-\ning\u2019s factors and cabined Wilder and Wright. \nThe Court in Gonzaga and Talevski emphasized \nthe clear-rights-creating-language requirement to \nensure that lower courts do not loosely imply private \nrights enforceable through Section 1983. Yet despite \nthis Court\u2019s best efforts, lower courts have been slow \nto implement these instructions. As the decision \nbelow proves, \u201ceven after\u201d Talevski, some lower courts \nstill feel they \u201clack the guidance inferior judges need.\u201d \nPet.App.35a\u201336a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment). So the Court should provide it now. \nBlessing, Wilder, and Wright continue to sow \nconfusion, as Judge Richardson\u2019s concurrences prove. \nPet.App.35a\u201336a, 65a, 120a\u201325a. In Wilder, the \nCourt looked \u201cbeyond the unambiguous terms of the \nstatute\u201d \nand \nrelied \non \n\u201cpolicy \nconsiderations \npurportedly derived from legislative history and \nsuperseded versions of the statute\u201d to find a privately \nenforceable right. 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., \ndissenting). Blessing reached a different result, but it \nis remembered more for its distillation of \u201cthree \nfactors,\u201d 520 U.S. at 340, from Wilder and Wright. \nCourts and litigants alike have unfortunately read all \nthree cases as \u201cestablish[ing] a relatively loose \nstandard for finding rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282.  \nAttempting to set the record straight, Gonzaga \ndisavowed any reading of Blessing, Wilder, and \nWright that might \u201csuggest that something less than \nan unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Ibid. And in assessing whether FERPA\u2019s \n\n46 \n \nprovisions created privately enforceable rights, the \nCourt did not apply the Blessing factors. Id. at 287\u2013\n90. In fact, when Justice Stevens argued in dissent \nthat separation of powers would be better served by \nthe Blessing test, id. at 300\u201302 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning), the majority countered that it \u201cfail[ed] to see how \nrelations between the branches are served by having \ncourts apply a multifactor balancing test to pick and \nchoose which federal requirements may be enforced \nby \u00a7 1983 and which may not,\u201d id. at 286. \nTurning to Wilder and Wright, the Gonzaga Court \nnoted that in both cases, Congress had \u201cexplicitly \nconferred specific monetary entitlements upon the \nplaintiffs.\u201d Id. at 280. In contrast, the student \nplaintiff \u2019s attempt to find a federally enforceable right \nin FERPA was \u201ca far cry from the sort of individu-\nalized, concrete monetary entitlement found enforce-\nable\u201d in Wilder and Wright. Id. at 288 n.6. Years later, \nthe Armstrong majority took specific aim at Wilder, \nobserving that \u201clater opinions\u201d like Gonzaga \u201cplainly \nrepudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action \nthat Wilder exemplified.\u201d 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. \nMore recently, this Court\u2019s decision in Talevski \nreaffirmed Gonzaga\u2019s analysis. All nine Justices \njoined opinions confirming that Gonzaga establishes \nthe \u201ctest for determining whether a particular federal \nlaw actually secures rights for \u00a7 1983 purposes.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 175; id. at 183 (\u201cGonzaga sets \nforth our established method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral.\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) \n(\u201cGonzaga \nsets \nthe \nstandard \nfor \ndetermining when a Spending Clause statute confers \nindividual rights\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(Gonzaga sets forth the Court\u2019s \u201cestablished method\u201d) \n\n47 \n \n(cleaned up). And all nine Justices agreed Gonzaga\u2019s \nunambiguous-conferral test sets a \u201chigh\u201d and \n\u201cdemanding bar.\u201d Id. at 180; id. at 184 (\u201csignificant \nhurdle\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar \nis high\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \n\u201cwith the Court\u2019s understanding of the high bar\u201d). \nDespite that unanimity, the Court left some \nthings unsaid. And the Fourth Circuit used that \nsilence to double down on its prior opinions after \nTalevski. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. \nFirst, while Talevski did not apply the Blessing \nfactors, it did not overrule Blessing or expressly \ndisavow its test.5 So on remand, the Fourth Circuit \nreasoned that while Talevski had \u201cshed some new \nlight on Blessing,\u201d it was not for the court \u201cto proclaim \na Supreme Court precedent [had been] overthrown.\u201d \nPet.App.21a\u201322a. The court expected at least \u201csome \ndiscussion of Blessing had it been jettisoned,\u201d so it felt \nthat it \u201cremain[ed] bound by Blessing until given \nexplicit instructions to the contrary\u2014instructions \nthat have yet to come.\u201d Ibid. \nSecond, although Talevski did not cite Wright or \nWilder, it didn\u2019t overrule them either. So the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s most recent decision continued to rely on \nWilder. In the court\u2019s view, Wilder had \u201calready held \nthat a different funding condition\u201d in Section 1396a(a) \n\u201cconfers individual rights enforceable via\u201d Section \n \n5 But see The Supreme Court 2022 Term, 42 U.S.C. 1983 \u2013 \nSpending Clause \u2013 Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 380, 388 (2023) (observing that the \nTalevski \u201cmajority affirmed the Seventh Circuit while silently \nabandoning the very test the Seventh Circuit believed \ngoverned,\u201d namely Blessing\u2019s three-factored test). \n\n48 \n \n1983. Pet.App.27a. So the Fourth Circuit thought that \nWilder \u201cappear[ed] to doom the State\u2019s argument\u201d \nthat the any-qualified-provider provision is not \nprivately enforceable because it focuses on govern-\nment officials overseeing funding. Ibid. And the court \ndid not believe that the Armstrong majority had effec-\ntively overruled Wilder, insisting instead that \u201c[t]he \nserious business of spurning a precedent cannot be \nprecipitated by winks and nods.\u201d Pet.App.28a. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Court should make \nclear that it has abandoned the Blessing test that \nsome lower courts still feel bound to apply \u201ceven after\u201d \nTalevski. Pet.App.35a. See, e.g., Saint Anthony Hosp. \nv. Whitehorn, 100 F.4th 767, 779 (7th Cir. 2024) \n(noting that Talevski did not \u201cdisapprove of Blessing\u201d \nand claiming not to \u201csee a fundamental difference \nbetween the Talevski/Gonzaga standard \u2026 and the \nfirst and third Blessing factors\u201d), reh\u2019g granted and \nopinion vacated, No. 21-2325, 2024 WL 3561942 (7th \nCir. July 24, 2024); Fed. L. Enf \u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Att\u2019y \nGen. N.J., 93 F.4th 122, 130 (3d Cir. 2024) (observing \nthat this Court \u201chas not expressly held that the \nBlessing factors are no longer relevant\u201d and applying \nthose factors in a footnote). \nThe Court did something similar in Kennedy v. \nBremerton School District, 597 U.S. 507 (2022). \nThere, the Court clarified \u201cthat the shortcomings \nassociated with [the] ambitious, abstract, and \nahistorical approach to the Establishment Clause\u201d \nadopted in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), \nhad become \u201cso apparent\u201d that the Court had \u201clong \nago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test \noffshoot.\u201d Id. at 534 (cleaned up). \n\n49 \n \nBefore Kennedy, \u201c[t]he Court [had] explained that \nthese tests [had] invited chaos in lower courts, led to \ndiffering results in materially identical cases, and \ncreated a minefield for legislators.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). \nAnd more recently, the Court had rejected Lemon-\nbased arguments while, \u201c[i]n place of Lemon and the \nendorsement test,\u201d instructing \u201cthat the Establish-\nment Clause must be interpreted by reference to \nhistorical practices and understandings.\u201d Id. at 535\u2013\n36 (cleaned up). That focus had \u201clong represented the \nrule rather than some exception within the Court\u2019s \nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence.\u201d Id. at 536 \n(cleaned up). And the lower courts had \u201cerred by \nfailing to heed this guidance.\u201d Ibid. \nSo too here. This Court has not applied Blessing\u2019s \nthree factors since Blessing itself. 520 U.S. at 340\u201341. \nAnd even in Blessing, the Court merely said that they \nwere the \u201cthree factors\u201d the Court had \u201ctraditionally \nlooked at \u2026 when determining whether a particular \nstatutory provision gives rise to a federal right.\u201d Id. at \n340. That framing is more descriptive than pre-\nscriptive. And it is no longer an accurate description \nof what this Court considers in this context. \nWhat\u2019s more, in acknowledging the \u201cconfusion\u201d \nand \u201cuncertainty\u201d Blessing has wrought, this Court \nhas rejected Blessing-based arguments, confirming \nthat its cases do not \u201cpermit anything short of an \nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of \naction brought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n282\u201383. Given all this, the Court should clarify, much \nlike it did in Kennedy, that it has \u201clong ago abandoned \n[Blessing] and its [three-factor] test.\u201d Kennedy, 597 \nU.S. at 534. \n\n50 \n \nThe Court also should clarify that Wilder and \nWright are limited to the unique monetary-entitle-\nment-conferring provisions at issue there. Despite \nthis Court saying that its \u201copinions plainly repudiate \nthe ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder \nexemplified,\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*, that was \nnot enough for the court below, Pet.App.27a\u201328a. And \nwhile Gonzaga cabined Wilder and Wright to cases \ninvolving spending provisions that \u201cexplicitly confer[ ] \nspecific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs,\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 288 n.6, the court below \nrelied on Wilder anyway, Pet.App.15a\u201316a, 27a.  \nAgain, this Court has done something similar in \nthe Establishment Clause context. Three Terms ago, \nthe Court explained that Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 \n(2004), \u201ccannot be read beyond its narrow focus on \nvocational religious degrees.\u201d Carson ex rel. O. C. v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 789 (2022). The Court should \nsimilarly clarify here that Wilder and Wright \u201ccannot \nbe read beyond [their] narrow focus,\u201d ibid., on \u201cthe \nsort of individualized, concrete monetary entitlement \nfound enforceable\u201d in those cases, Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 288 n.6. \nFinally, while the Court need not overrule \nBlessing, Wilder, or Wright to reverse the decision \nbelow, if the Court concludes more is required to guide \nlower courts, the Court should overrule all three. \n\u201cStare decisis is not an inexorable command, and the \nstare decisis considerations most relevant here\u2014the \nquality of the precedent\u2019s reasoning, the workability \nof the rule it established, and reliance on the \ndecision\u2014all weigh in favor of letting [all three \ndecisions] go.\u201d Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 \nU.S. 369, 407 (2024) (cleaned up). \n\n51 \n \n1. On the quality of the reasoning, Talevski \ncommands courts to \u201cemploy traditional tools of statu-\ntory construction to assess whether Congress has \nunambiguously conferred individual rights upon a \nclass of beneficiaries to which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d \n599 U.S. at 183 (cleaned up). But in Blessing, Wilder, \nand Wright, the Court did not use traditional tools of \nstatutory interpretation, nor did it ask whether \nCongress had unambiguously conferred a right. The \nCourt asked mainly whether Congress had imposed a \nmandatory benefit. See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341 \n(asking whether Congress imposed \u201ca binding \nobligation\u201d); Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509\u201310 (looking only \nfor mandatory benefits); Wright, 479 U.S. at 430\u201331 \n(same). That never should have been enough. See \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting); \nWright, 479 U.S. at 434 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). \n2. This trio of cases has also proven unworkable. \nAs shown by the decision below and the 5\u20132 circuit \nsplit, Wilder and Wright, along with Blessing\u2019s three-\nfactored test, have sown chaos and confusion in the \nlower courts. This Court tried to \u201cresolve [that] \nambiguity\u201d in Gonzaga. 536 U.S. at 278. But it didn\u2019t \nwork. \u201cVirtually all the circuits refused to read \nGonzaga as repudiating Blessing.\u201d The Supreme \nCourt 2022 Term, 137 Harv. L. Rev. at 388 (collecting \ncases). \u201cMany interpreted Gonzaga as merely glossing \nBlessing\u2019s first prong and began applying this \n\u2018Blessing-Gonzaga test\u2019 as controlling law.\u201d Ibid. \n(cleaned up) (collecting cases). Others \u201cread Gonzaga \nas providing merely \u2018principles\u2019 courts should keep \n\u2018firmly in mind\u2019 as they apply the \u2018Blessing test.\u2019\u201d Ibid. \n(quoting N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Child. v. Poole, \n922 F.3d 69, 79 (2d Cir. 2019)). \n\n52 \n \n3. This confusion means \u201carguments for reliance \n\u2026 are misplaced.\u201d S. Dakota v. Wayfair, 585 U.S. 162, \n186 (2018). \u201cThis is especially so because\u201d Congress, \nthe states, and private parties \u201chave been on notice \nfor years regarding this Court\u2019s misgivings\u201d about all \nthree cases. Janus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., and \nMun. Emps., Council 31, 585 U.S. 878, 927 (2018). \nAlso, Congress repealed the amendment in Wilder \n\u201cand replaced it with narrower language\u201d to give the \nstates more flexibility. Long Term Care Pharmacy All. \nv. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2004).  \nIn short, given how badly their \u201cdoctrinal under-\npinnings have \u2026 eroded,\u201d how \u201cunworkable\u201d they\u2019ve \nproved, Kimble v. Marvel Ent., LLC, 576 U.S. 446, \n458\u201359 (2015), and how little reliance exists, the \nCourt would be justified in overruling all three cases. \nIII. Reversal would respect separation of pow-\ners and enable states to better steward \nscarce Medicaid resources. \n\u201cUnder the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, \nCongress and the President may update the law to \nmeet modern policy priorities and needs.\u201d Arizona v. \nNavajo Nation, 599 U.S. 555, 566 (2023). \u201cBut it is not \nthe Judiciary\u2019s role to update the law.\u201d Ibid. And it is \n\u201cparticularly important that the federal courts not do \nso\u201d in cases involving the allocation of scarce resour-\nces that leave states in a \u201czero-sum situation.\u201d Ibid. \nIn Navajo Nation, that resource was \u201cwater in the \narid regions of the American West.\u201d Ibid. Here, it\u2019s \nMedicaid dollars. \u201cAnd the zero-sum reality\u201d of both \n\u201cunderscores that courts must stay in their proper \nconstitutional lane and interpret the law \u2026 according \n\n53 \n \nto its text and history, leaving to Congress and the \nPresident\u201d the task of updating the law in light of \n\u201ccompeting contemporary needs.\u201d Id. at 567. \nThe Medicaid program is expensive for states. \n\u201cOn average, states spend 29% of their annual \nbudgets on costs related to Medicaid.\u201d Br. of Amici \nCuriae U.S. Senators and Representatives at 12, July \n5, 2024. \u201cThat makes Medicaid the costliest expendi-\nture for many state budgets.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). \n(Medicaid is a 24.3% share of South Carolina\u2019s state \nbudget. South Carolina At-a-Glance, State Health \nAccess Data Assistance Center, perma.cc/X3VL-\n25WT).  \nWhen federal courts discover private rights \nburied in state plan requirements, those costs \nincrease exponentially. \u201cAuthorizing lawsuits by \npatients to challenge their providers\u2019 terminations \nburdens state agencies with redundant and intrusive \noversight while the high cost of federal litigation \ndisplaces more efficient uses of state resources.\u201d \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventive Health Servs. v. Smith, 913 F.3d 551, 571 \n(5th \nCir. \n2019) \n(Jones, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nAnd \nRespondents\u2019 position creates the \u201cthreat of a federal \nlawsuit\u2014and its attendant costs and fees\u2014whenever \n[a state makes] changes\u201d to its list of qualified \nproviders. Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, \nInc., 586 U.S. 1057, 1058 (2018) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting from the denial of cert.). Even just the \nthreat of litigation can impose real costs on real \npeople as the \u201clooming potential for complex litigation \ninevitably will dissuade state officials from making \ndecisions that they believe to be in the public \ninterest.\u201d Ibid. \n\n54 \n \nThe scope of such litigation is staggering. In a \n2020 report, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General reported \nmore than 9,000 terminated Medicaid providers in its \ndatabase. Department of Health & Human Services \nOffice of the Inspector General, States Could Do More \nTo Prevent Terminated Providers From Serving \nMedicaid \nBeneficiaries \nat \n7 \n(Mar. \n2020), \nperma.cc/9JLQ-J696. Under Respondents\u2019 theory, \nbeneficiaries in each state have a right to file a \nSection 1983 lawsuit that seeks the reinstatement of \nevery one of those providers\u2014plus damages and \nattorney fees. \nThe problem is exponentially worse when consid-\nering more than just qualified-provider litigation. \nGiven the broader questions this case implicates, the \nCourt\u2019s decision could impact the costs imposed on \nstates across a host of federal spending programs. In \nthe adoption-and-foster-care context, for example, \nJudge Livingston has raised the alarm that\u2014under \nthe kinds of arguments that Respondents raise here\u2014\nstate foster-care programs face an \u201cunfortunate and \nunsupportable risk of increased litigation\u201d under the \nAdoption \nAssistance \nand \nChild \nWelfare \nAct, \n\u201cinconsistent results\u201d in those cases, \u201cand disorderly \nadministration, none of which will inure to those \nprograms\u2019 benefit.\u201d Poole, 922 F.3d at 95 (Livingston, \nJ., dissenting) (cleaned up). That \u201craises the prospect \nthat scarce foster care resources, instead of going to \nfoster children, will be squandered in litigation \ndestined to produce arbitrary and inconsistent \nresults.\u201d Id. at 97. If those costs are to be imposed on \nstates, that choice is best left to the people\u2019s elected \nrepresentatives in Congress. \n\n55 \n \n* * * \nNothing in the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext or structure unambiguously expresses congres-\nsional intent to confer a federal private right on \nanyone. To hold otherwise would encroach upon the \nexecutive and legislative branches\u2019 prerogatives while \nincreasing the cost to the states of providing medical \ncare to their neediest citizens. And doing so would \ndrop Gonzaga\u2019s supposedly \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d 599 \nU.S. at 180, to the floor. Because the text and \nstructure of the any-qualified-provider provision do \nnot present the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. at 183, that provi-\nsion does not create private rights enforceable under \nSection 1983.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the courts of appeals should be \nreversed. \n        Respectfully submitted, \nFEBRUARY 2025 \n \nKELLY M.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief was a state of no knowledge regarding the specific legal facts, precedents, or arguments in *Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic*.\n\nBased on the new observation, my understanding has been updated significantly. I now know that the central legal question is one of statutory interpretation: whether the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision (specifically, the \"any qualified provider\" language) unambiguously confers a private right of action for a beneficiary to sue the state. This right would likely be enforced through 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\n\nA critical piece of context that will inform my prediction is the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudential trend, which has shown a general skepticism toward implying private rights of action where a statute does not explicitly create one. This judicial environment suggests a potential predisposition against the respondents (Planned Parenthood and the beneficiary) and in favor of the petitioner (South Carolina). To make an accurate prediction, I must now focus on analyzing the specific arguments the parties will present in their briefs to see how they address this skeptical legal landscape. The petitioner's brief will be particularly important for understanding the arguments against finding such a right.",

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to build. I previously established that the central issue is whether the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision creates a private right of action under \u00a7 1983, and I noted the Supreme Court's general skepticism towards such implied rights.\n\nThe petitioner's merits brief provides the specific legal architecture for a ruling in favor of South Carolina, significantly sharpening my predictive model. My beliefs are now updated with the following key arguments and legal precedents:\n\n1.  **The *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* Standard is Paramount:** The petitioner's entire case is built on the \"demanding bar\" set by *Gonzaga University v. Doe* and recently affirmed in *Health & Hospital Corp. v. Talevski*. This standard requires that a statute \"unambiguously confer individual federal rights\" using \"explicit rights-creating terms.\" The petitioner argues the typical remedy is not a private lawsuit but action by the HHS Secretary to terminate funds.\n\n2.  **Textual and Structural Arguments Against a \"Right\":**\n    *   **Text:** The petitioner emphasizes that the statutory language\u2014a state plan must provide that a beneficiary \"may obtain\" services from \"any qualified provider\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A))\u2014lacks the explicit word \"right.\"\n    *   **Structure:** This provision is just one of 87 disparate items in a section labeled \"Contents\" for a state plan. The petitioner contrasts this with the provisions in *Talevski*, which were found in a section of the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA) explicitly titled \"[r]equirements relating to residents' rights\" and which used the word \"right\" repeatedly (e.g., \"right to be free from,\" \"discharge rights\").\n    *   **Intra-Statutory Comparison:** The petitioner makes a powerful point by highlighting that when Congress *did* want to create a right to choose a provider within the same statutory scheme (FNHRA), it did so unambiguously, granting a resident the \"right to choose a personal attending physician\" (\u00a7 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i)). The absence of such language in the provision at issue here is presented as dispositive.\n\n3.  **A Strategy to Sideline Unfavorable Precedent:** The petitioner explicitly asks the Court to \"clarify that it has abandoned *Blessing*'s factors and cabined *Wilder* and *Wright*.\" These older cases used a more lenient test for finding private rights. By framing the request as a \"clarification\" rather than an overruling, the petitioner offers the Court a path to discard the older, more permissive framework in favor of the stricter *Gonzaga* standard without formally overturning precedent. This is a pragmatic legal strategy that often appeals to a majority of the Court.\n\n4.  **Alternative Remedial Schemes:** The brief reinforces the idea that private lawsuits are unnecessary and disruptive. It points to two other remedies: (1) the federal remedy, where the HHS Secretary can withhold funds for non-compliance (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c), and (2) the state-level remedy, where South Carolina law provides an administrative appeal process for *providers* who are terminated. This suggests Congress intended for enforcement to be handled at the administrative and governmental level, not through individual litigation by beneficiaries.\n\nMy confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioner has substantially increased. The petitioner's brief does not merely rely on a general jurisprudential trend; it provides a clear, text-and-structure-based roadmap that directly leverages the Court's most recent and relevant precedents (*Gonzaga*, *Talevski*) to argue that the \"any-qualified-provider\" clause fails to create an enforceable private right. The arguments are precisely tailored to the Court's current interpretive methods.",

It demonstrates an understanding of the hierarchy and purpose of different legal filings (brief in opposition vs. merits brief) and the logical sequence of analysis (party briefs first, then key amicus briefs like the Solicitor General's).

I previously established that the central issue is whether the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision creates a private right of action under \u00a7 1983, and I noted the Supreme Court's general skepticism towards such implied rights. The petitioner's merits brief provided a clear roadmap for a ruling in their favor, built on the strict *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard, textual arguments about the absence of \"rights-creating\" language, structural comparisons to other statutes, and the existence of alternative remedial schemes. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioner was high based on that brief's alignment with the Court's recent jurisprudence.\n\nThe observation of the respondents' Brief in Opposition to certiorari now provides the crucial counter-arguments, adding significant texture and contestability to my predictive model. While this document was filed to argue against the Court taking the case (an effort that was ultimately unsuccessful), it clearly outlines the legal framework the respondents will use on the merits.\n\nMy beliefs are updated with the respondents' core arguments:\n\n1.  **The Provision *Satisfies* the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* Standard:** The respondents directly confront the petitioner's main argument. They contend that the statutory language\u2014\"any individual eligible for medical assistance... may obtain such assistance\" from any qualified provider (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A))\u2014*does* meet the *Gonzaga* test. They argue this text is \"phrased in terms of the persons benefited\" and has an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" (the individual Medicaid recipient), which is the exact language the Court has used to identify an enforceable right.\n\n2.  ***Talevski* as Affirmation, Not Contradiction:** Far from seeing *Talevski* as a barrier, the respondents frame it as supportive. They argue that the Fourth Circuit, on remand, \"faithfully apply[ed]\" *Talevski* and unanimously (across three judges) concluded again that the right is enforceable. They will argue the language in the free-choice provision is \"similar\" to the rights-creating language the Court found sufficient in *Talevski*, directly countering the petitioner's attempt to distinguish the cases based on section titles or the specific word \"right.\"\n\n3.  **Focus on the Beneficiary's Right, Not the Provider's Status:** The respondents' argument is centered on the *patient's* right to choose, personified by respondent Julie Edwards. This is a critical distinction. While the petitioner points to an administrative remedy for a terminated *provider*, the respondents argue this does nothing to vindicate the right of the *beneficiary* to continue seeing their chosen, qualified provider. The right, they claim, belongs to the individual, not the institution.\n\n4.  **The \"Qualified\" Provider Fact is Undisputed:** The brief repeatedly emphasizes that South Carolina does not contest that Planned Parenthood is a \"qualified\" provider. The termination was based on its separate, non-Medicaid-funded abortion services. This fact is crucial because it allows the respondents to frame the state's action as arbitrary and contrary to the statute, which grants a choice among *all* qualified providers, not just a state-approved subset.\n\nMy confidence in a straightforward victory for the petitioner has been significantly moderated. The respondents have a plausible, text-based argument that fits squarely within the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework. The case is no longer about a general trend but a specific interpretive clash: Is the petitioner's structural argument (no \"rights\" language, placement in a \"Contents\" section) more persuasive than the respondents' textual argument (focus on the \"individual\" who \"may obtain\" services)? The fact that the Fourth Circuit, post-*Talevski*, unanimously sided with the respondents suggests their argument has substantial legal merit and cannot be easily dismissed. The prediction is now more uncertain, hinging on which application of the *Gonzaga* standard the majority finds more compelling.",

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to build. I previously established that the central issue is whether the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision creates a private right of action under \u00a7 1983, and I noted the Supreme Court's general skepticism towards such implied rights. The petitioner's merits brief provided a clear roadmap for a ruling in their favor, built on the strict *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard, textual arguments about the absence of \"rights-creating\" language, structural comparisons to other statutes, and the existence of alternative remedial schemes. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioner was high based on that brief's alignment with the Court's recent jurisprudence.\n\nThe observation of the respondents' Brief in Opposition to certiorari provided the crucial counter-arguments, adding significant texture and contestability to my predictive model. My beliefs were updated with the respondents' core arguments:\n\n1.  **The Provision *Satisfies* the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* Standard:** The respondents directly confront the petitioner's main argument. They contend that the statutory language\u2014\"any individual eligible for medical assistance... may obtain such assistance\" from any qualified provider (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A))\u2014*does* meet the *Gonzaga* test. They argue this text is \"phrased in terms of the persons benefited\" and has an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" (the individual Medicaid recipient), which is the exact language the Court has used to identify an enforceable right.\n\n2.  ***Talevski* as Affirmation, Not Contradiction:** Far from seeing *Talevski* as a barrier, the respondents frame it as supportive. They argue that the Fourth Circuit, on remand, \"faithfully apply[ed]\" *Talevski* and unanimously (across three judges) concluded again that the right is enforceable. They will argue the language in the free-choice provision is \"similar\" to the rights-creating language the Court found sufficient in *Talevski*.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Beneficiary's Right, Not the Provider's Status:** The respondents' argument is centered on the *patient's* right to choose. While the petitioner points to an administrative remedy for a terminated *provider*, the respondents argue this does nothing to vindicate the right of the *beneficiary* to continue seeing their chosen, qualified provider.\n\n4.  **The \"Qualified\" Provider Fact is Undisputed:** The brief repeatedly emphasizes that South Carolina does not contest that Planned Parenthood is a \"qualified\" provider for Medicaid purposes. This allows the respondents to frame the state's action as arbitrary and contrary to the statute, which grants a choice among *all* qualified providers, not just a state-approved subset.\n\nThe latest observation, which is a reflection on my own analytical process, adds a crucial layer of context to my beliefs. I now recognize that the respondents' arguments I have analyzed are from their Brief in Opposition to certiorari\u2014a document written to persuade the Court *not* to take the case. While this brief provides a strong outline of their legal theory, it is not their final, most developed argument on the merits. My previous moderation of confidence was based on this preliminary document. The respondents' full merits brief, which will be written to directly rebut the petitioner's merits brief, remains the most critical missing piece of evidence. My current understanding of the respondents' position is therefore provisional. The key uncertainty is whether their merits brief will simply elaborate on the points from their opposition brief or introduce new arguments and rebuttals. This clarifies that my predictive model is incomplete pending the review of that definitive document and, subsequently, influential amicus briefs like one from the Solicitor General.",

This confirms that either the merits brief is not yet available in the docket, or my search strategy is flawed. The Brief in Opposition is useful, but it's not the final, definitive argument. I cannot make a confident prediction without the respondent's full merits brief, which directly answers the petitioner's arguments and is framed for a final decision. Before I proceed to other documents like amicus briefs, I must make one more, broader attempt to locate this key document. Instead of filtering by `proceeding_title` which has proven unreliable, I will search for all documents with 'brief' in the filename and 'main' in the link_name to get a comprehensive list of all major briefs filed in this case. This will allow me to manually identify the respondent's merits brief if it exists, or confirm its absence if it does not appear."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is progressively sharpening, though a key piece of evidence remains outstanding. I have established that the central legal question is whether the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) unambiguously creates a private right of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n\nMy initial analysis of the petitioner's merits brief gave me a strong baseline, suggesting a ruling in their favor. Their argument is built on the Supreme Court's recent, stricter jurisprudence (*Gonzaga*, *Talevski*), contending that the statute's text is directed at the state's plan requirements rather than conferring an individual right, and that an alternative remedial scheme exists (for providers).\n\nMy beliefs were then updated and complicated by the respondents' Brief in Opposition to certiorari. This document provided the core of their counter-argument:\n1.  **The Provision Meets the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* Standard:** They argue the text\u2014\"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\"\u2014is the exact kind of \"rights-creating\" language focused on the \"persons benefited\" that the Court looks for.\n2.  ***Talevski* is Affirmative:** They frame the Court's recent *Talevski* decision as a validation of their position, noting the Fourth Circuit reapplied it and reached the same conclusion. They see the language as analogous to the rights-creating text in *Talevski*.\n3.  **Beneficiary's Right vs. Provider's Remedy:** They distinguish the beneficiary's right to choose from a provider's right to participate, arguing the administrative remedies available to a terminated provider do nothing to vindicate the patient's statutory right.\n\nI had previously recognized that these arguments were from a Brief in Opposition, a document with a different strategic purpose than a full merits brief. This introduced a significant uncertainty: whether the respondents' final arguments would simply expand on these points or introduce new ones.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014a failed search for the respondents' merits brief which instead returned the Brief in Opposition I have already analyzed\u2014directly addresses this uncertainty. This observation provides a crucial procedural fact: the respondents' merits brief is not yet available to me. This confirms that the key piece of evidence I previously identified as missing is, in fact, still missing. This observation does not introduce new legal arguments or change my substantive understanding of the clash. However, it solidifies my belief that my current model of the respondents' case is provisional. My analysis of the Brief in Opposition remains the best available proxy for their arguments, but it is not the definitive statement. My confidence in a final prediction remains moderated, and I cannot meaningfully update it until I can review the respondents' full merits brief, which will be their direct and most developed response to the petitioner's case.",

This aspect of its advocacy is reflected \nin the regular representation of those challenging \ngovernment overreach and other actions in violation of the \nconstitutional framework. See, e.g., Util. Air Regulatory \nGrp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. \nDep\u2019t of Def., 138 S. Ct. 617 (2018). SLF also regularly \nfiles amicus curiae briefs with this Court about issues of \nagency overreach and deference. See, e.g., Kisor v. Wilkie, \n139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019); Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, \n603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nStates possess the inherent sovereign authority to \ndecide with whom they will contract. When Congress \npassed the Medicaid Act, it neither said nor suggested \nthat federal courts, not the State itself, would decide which \nentities were qualified to provide healthcare in that State. \nDespite that, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \nappointed itself arbiter of healthcare qualifications and \nforced South Carolina\u2019s hand by requiring it to subsidize \nPlanned Parenthood with taxpayer money. \n1.\u2002 Rule 37 statement: No party\u2019s counsel authored any of \nthis brief; Amicus alone funded its preparation and submission. \nSee Sup. Ct. R. 37.6.\n\n2\nCongress did not grant the courts that role. Indeed, \nCongress labored to preserve each state\u2019s sovereign \ndiscretion. The Medicaid Act does not confer an individual \nright enforceable in federal court\u2014nor could it do so \nconsistent with our Constitution. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion strays so far from the constitutional order \nbecause of a faulty foundation. This case should prompt \nan originalist examination of the underlying constitutional \nprinciples at issue and the Court should return its \njurisprudence to solid ground once and for all.\nAlthough this case is postured as a Spending Clause \ncase, the Court should begin with an examination of \nthe General Welfare Clause. The former only exists \nbecause of a twisted reading of the latter. The Court\u2019s \njurisprudence will not align with the text, history, and \ntradition of the Constitution until the Court re-examines \nthe General Welfare Clause itself. Tweaking Spending \nClause jurisprudence year after year merely repaints \na constitutional fa\u00e7ade that is built upon a rotting \nfoundation. Current precedent is badly out of step with \nthe original public meaning of the clause, as well as its \nhistory and tradition, and even its plain text. For too long, \nthis misreading of the General Welfare Clause has created \nspending powers divorced from Congress\u2019s enumerated \nlegislative powers. That invention is as atextual as it is \nahistorical. Because an accurate reading of the General \nWelfare Clause would resolve this case, the Court should \ncarefully re-examine its existing jurisprudence. Existing \nprecedent in this area is \u201cegregiously wrong,\u201d and \u201con a \ncollision course with the Constitution from the day it was \ndecided\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Cf. Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., \n597 U.S. 215, 268 (2022). The sooner it is corrected, the \nbetter.\n\n3\nIn the alternative, the Medicaid Act is too ambiguous \nto have created an individual right enforceable under \n\u00a7\u00a0 1983. A long tradition of cases has clarified that \nenactments pursuant to the spending power, like the \nMedicaid Act, must provide clear and unambiguous notice \nto the recipient state of its obligations. That is not so here \nfor two reasons. First, the effect of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nreading of the Act is to transform Medicaid from a state-\nrun system to one where the State can no longer exclude \nparticipants without federal court say-so. And second, \neven if the Act does provide clear notice that it is creating \nan enforceable right, the contours and effect of that right \nare anything but clear. The recipient state must actually \nknow what it is agreeing to. That could not occur here.\nIn either case, this Court should reverse the decision \nof the Fourth Circuit.\nARGUMENT\nI.\t The Court Should Revisit Its Spending Clause \nJurisprudence. \nThis Court\u2019s jurisprudence has for centuries misread \nthe General Welfare Clause to create a spending power. \nThat misreading has been dubbed the Spending Clause. \nNo such clause exists: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power \nTo lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence \nand general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, \nImposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the \nUnited States[.]\u201d U.S. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1. The text \nitself is clear that the second portion of the clause is a \nlimitation on Congress\u2019s power to tax\u2014not a separate \n\n4\npower to spend. This Court\u2019s jurisprudence has strayed \nfar afield from the original meaning.\nThe Court, in recent years, has faithfully worked \nto correct its jurisprudence to reflect the Constitution\u2019s \noriginal public meaning by analyzing its text and history. \nSee, e.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Piston Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. \n1, 22, 24 (2022) (interpreting Second Amendment based \non \u201cconstitutional text and history\u201d); Dobbs, 597 U.S. at \n240; Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 578\u201379 \n(2014); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 595 \n(2008) (\u201cThere seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both \ntext and history, that the Second Amendment conferred \nan individual right to keep and bear arms.\u201d). This work \nhas employed \u201c[a]n analysis focused on original meaning \nand history\u201d as the \u201crule,\u201d not the \u201cexception,\u201d to better \nenforce constitutional provisions as understood by those \nwho enacted them. Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 \nU.S. 507, 536 (2022). This case presents an opportunity \nto continue that work and restore the original meaning \nof the General Welfare Clause.\nOriginalism posits that the meaning of terms is fixed \nat the time of ratification. Lawrence Solum, The Fixation \nThesis: The Role of Historical Fact in Original Meaning, \n91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1, 1\u20132 (2015). It ensures respect \nfor \u201cthe consent of the governed with which the actions \nof the governors must be squared.\u201d Edwin Meese III, \nPerspective on the Authoritativeness of Supreme Court \nDecision: the Law of the Constitution, 61 Tul. L. Rev. 979, \n986 (1987). It excludes the notion that meaning changes \nover time because a democratic society \u201cdoes not, by \nand large, need constitutional guarantees to ensure that \nits laws will reflect \u2018current values.\u2019\u201d Antonin Scalia, \n\n5\nOriginalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849, 862 \n(1989). Originalism, therefore, \u201cfollows inexorably\u201d from \nour commitment to a written constitution. Randy Barnett, \nAn Originalism for Nonoriginalists, 45 Loy. U.

Rev. \n611, 636 (1999).\nThis contrasts with living constitutionalism, or \u201cthe \ndoctrine that the Constitution should be interpreted \nand applied in accordance with changing circumstances \nand, in particular, with changes in social values.\u201d Living \nConstitutionalism, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Westlaw \n12th ed. 2024). Living constitutionalism \u201callow[s] judges \nto adopt novel constitutional constructions in response to \nchanging values and circumstance.\u201d Randy E. Barnett & \nLawrence B. Solum, Originalism After Dobbs, Bruen, \nand Kennedy: The Role of History and Tradition, 118 Nw. \nU. L. Rev. 433, 451 (2023). Originalists maintain that living \nconstitutionalists (1) subvert the rule of law by permitting \njudges to make constitutional rulings based on their \nsubjective beliefs instead of the fixed meaning of the text;\n(2) undermine the separation of powers by empowering \njudges to make and apply constitutional law instead of \neffecting the meaning of the constitutional text and \npreexisting legal rules; and (3) undermine popular \nsovereignty by elevating the authority of judges over the \npeople\u2019s will as expressed through enacting supermajorities \nor constitutional conventions. Id. at 479\u201380.\nThis Court was presented with an opportunity to \nrevisit its General Welfare Clause jurisprudence with \nan originalist eye in Health & Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski. See 599 U.S. 166, 177\u201380 \n(2023). The majority explained then that \u201csomething \nmore than ambiguous historical evidence is required \n\n6\nbefore we will flatly overrule a number of major decisions \nof this Court.\u201d Id. at 179 (quotation marks omitted). Yet \na thorough review of the evidence shows anything but \nambiguity because both the text and historical record \nsupport only one conclusion: there is no Spending Clause, \nand Congress\u2019s power to spend is a component of the \nnecessary and proper exercise of its enumerated powers. \nThe evidence unambiguously shows that the Constitution \nlimits Congress\u2019s authority to spend to its enumerated \npowers. Congress does not possess an indiscriminate \npower to spend in the name of \u201cgeneral Welfare,\u201d \ndisconnected from its enumerated powers.\nJustice Thomas highlighted that evidence in his \nTalevski dissent. Id. at 206 (Thomas, J., dissenting). And \nalthough he was alone in his dissent, his views on the \ntopic find many allies in the scholarship. See, e.g., Philip \nHamburger, Purchasing Submission 76 (2021); Jeffrey \nT. Renz, What Spending Clause? \u2013 (Or the President\u2019s \nParamour): An Examination of the Views of Hamilton, \nMadison, and Story on Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 \nof the United States Constitution, 33 John Marshall L. \nRev. 81 (1999); David E. Engdahl, The Contract Thesis of \nthe Federal Spending Power, 52 S.D. L. Rev. 496 (2007); \nRobert Natelson, The General Welfare Clause and the \nPublic Trust: An Essay in Original Understanding, \n52 Kan. L. Rev. 1, 23\u201329 (2003). There is a remarkable \nconsensus that the clause limits the taxing power rather \nthan creates an independent power to spend. That \nconsensus comes from not only the text itself, but also \nthe historical record.\nOne compelling anecdote is that of Gouverneur \nMorris\u2019s attempt to shift the meaning of the clause as part \n\n7\nof the Constitutional Convention\u2019s Committee of Style. \nGouverneur Morris was one proponent of giving Congress \na general legislative power. He was not alone. In fact, \nproposals to include a general legislative power failed no \nless than five separate times during the Convention. See \nRenz, 33 John Marshall L. Rev. at 104\u201305 (recounting five \nrejected attempts \u201cto insert a grant of general legislative \npower into the Constitution\u201d).\nAfter these many failed (and well-documented) \nattempts to introduce a general legislative spending power \nopenly, Gouverneur Morris attempted to sneak the power \ninto the Constitution. Id. at 105. He replaced the comma \nafter \u201cExcises\u201d with a semicolon, altering the meaning of \nthe clause to create two separate powers rather than one \nlimited and conjoined power. See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 208 \nn.23 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (recounting this anecdote). \nReplacing the comma with a semicolon created a new \nclause with a standalone power to spend: the power \u201cto \npay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and \ngeneral Welfare of the United States.\u201d See U.S. Const. \nArt. 1, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1. \u201cThe Convention, however, recognized \nthe alteration and restored the comma, \u2018corroborat[ing] \nthe conclusion that the\u00a0General Welfare Clause\u00a0was not \nan independent power.\u2019\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 208 n.23 \n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Natelson, 52 Kan. L. \nRev. at 28).\nAnd the evidence from the Convention does not stand \nalone. Accounts of the time provide further corroboration. \nAs Federalist advocates went out to defend the General \nWelfare Clause to the public, \u201ctheir basic message \nwas that the language in question was not a grant at \nall\u2014rather it was a restriction on federal authority.\u201d \n\n8\nNatelson, 52 Kan. L. Rev. at 39; see also, e.g., 3 Debates \non the Constitution 207 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (E. Randolph, \nVirginia Convention) (\u201cThe plain and obvious meaning of \nthis is, that no more duties, taxes, imposts, and excises, \nshall be laid, than are sufficient to pay the debts, and \nprovide for the common defence and general welfare, of \nthe United States\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Noah Webster, An Examination \nInto the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, \nin Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States 50 \n(P. Ford ed. 1888).\nWhat this demonstrates is that the General Welfare \nClause is not an independent source of federal power, but \na limitation on the taxing power. Although Congress can \ntax, it can only do so for the three listed purposes\u2014debts, \ndefense, and general welfare. That does not mean that \nCongress is empowered to spend on anything it deems \nin the \u201cgeneral Welfare.\u201d Rather, it limits Congress\u2019s \nuse of the taxing power to pay for only those uses of its \nenumerated powers that serve \u201cthe common Defence and \ngeneral Welfare\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1.\nFew said it with more vigor than did Madison in \nFederalist 41:\nSome, who have not denied the necessity of the \npower of taxation, have grounded a very fierce \nattack against the Constitution, on the language \nin which it is defined. It has been urged and \nechoed, that the power \u201cto lay and collect \ntaxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the \ndebts, and provide for the common defense and \ngeneral welfare of the United States,\u201d amounts \nto an unlimited commission to exercise every \n\n9\npower which may be alleged to be necessary \nfor the common defense or general welfare. No \nstronger proof could be given of the distress \nunder which these writers labor for objections, \nthan their stooping to such a misconstruction.\nThe Federalist No. 41, at 262 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Or, \nas Governor Randolph put it, \u201c[y]ou must violate every \nrule of construction and common sense, if you sever it \nfrom the power of raising money, and annex it to anything \nelse, in order to make it that formidable power which it \nis represented to be.\u201d 3 Debates on the Constitution 600. \nThe original public meaning of the clause is in little doubt. \nThat fact alone provides good reason to revise this Court\u2019s \njurisprudence to accord with the Constitution.\nYet another reason exists in how the Court moved \nto the understanding common today. The change was \nhastily penned with cursory reasoning. After laying out \nthe question, the Court explained that,\nWe shall not review the writings of public men \nand commentators or discuss the legislative \npractice. Study of all these leads us to conclude \nthat the reading advocated by Mr. Justice Story \nis the correct one. While, therefore, the power \nto tax is not unlimited, its confines are set in the \nclause which confers it, and not in those of \u00a7\u00a08 \nwhich bestow and define the legislative powers \nof the Congress. It results that the power of \nCongress to authorize expenditure of public \nmoneys for public purposes is not limited by \nthe direct grants of legislative power found in \nthe Constitution.\n\n10\nUnited States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 65\u201366 (1936); see also \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 211\u201319 (Thomas, J., dissenting) \n(providing the historical evolution of the meaning of the \nGeneral Welfare Clause and discussing the transition \nfrom Jefferson and Hamilton\u2019s initial agreement that the \nclause provided no \u201cindependent font of legislative power\u201d \nto the pre-Butler view that it permitted spending but no \nregulation).\nButler\u2019s reasoning is sharply out of alignment with \nthe Court\u2019s jurisprudential focus on the text, history, \nand tradition of the Constitution. The Court should take \nthis opportunity to align its precedent on the General \nWelfare Clause, and thus the ill-conceived doctrine of the \n\u201cSpending Clause,\u201d with the text, history, and original \npublic meaning of the Constitution.\nII.\t The Medicaid Act Does Not Create a Right Even \nUnder Existing Jurisprudence.  \nRevising this Court\u2019s jurisprudence would resolve \nthe present controversy, and the Court should take the \nopportunity not to go further down the wrong path. \nHowever, even under existing precedent, the Medicaid \nAct is too ambiguous to have created a private right of \naction under \u00a7\u00a01983.\nThe Medicaid Act is spending power legislation. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 323 (2015). \u201cThe legitimacy of Congress\u2019 power to \nlegislate under the spending power .\u00a0.\u00a0. rests on whether \nthe State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms \nof the \u2018contract.\u2019\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). Drawing on bedrock \n\n11\ncontract principles, this Court held that the State must \nhave clear notice of the condition. Arlington Cent. Sch. \nDist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).\nSpending enactments fail to provide clear notice when \n(1) the terms are altered from the original enactment \nor (2) as several circuit courts of appeals have held, the \nterms are unclear such that the State would not know its \nobligations. See Nat\u2019l Fed. of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 583 (2012) (NFIB); Kentucky v. Yellen, 67 F.4th \n325, 346 (6th Cir. 2023); West Virginia v. U.S. Dept. of \nthe Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1144\u201346 (11th Cir. 2023). In \nshort, \u201cunless Congress speaks with a clear voice, and \nmanifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual \nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for \nprivate enforcement by \u00a7\u00a01983.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 \nU.S. 273, 280 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThis Court explained in Talevski that this is a firm test. \n599 U.S. at 175. The Medicaid Act fails to provide clear \nnotice of Congress\u2019s unambiguous intent to confer an \nindividual right enforceable under \u00a7\u00a01983 via the Act\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01396a(a)(23).\nNFIB illustrates well the first way a statute can lack \nclear notice. 567 U.S. at 583. The Court squarely rejected \nthe idea that the federal power to compel states using the \nspending power was unlimited. Id. It was critical of the \nAffordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA\u2019s) expansion of the Medicaid \nAct because it was \u201ca shift in kind, not merely degree.\u201d \nId. The ACA \u201ctransformed\u201d Medicaid from a program to \nhelp \u201cthe needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly, and \nneedy families with dependent children .\u00a0.\u00a0. into a program \nto meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly \npopulation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Id. The Medicaid Act\u2019s lone clause that \n\n12\nreserved Congress\u2019s right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the Act \ndid not provide notice of this complete transformation. Id. \nat 584. The upshot is simple: states must be aware at the \noutset what obligations they are accepting.\nRecent cases at the circuit level under the American \nRescue Plan Act (ARPA) illustrate the second point: the \nState must be able to read the terms and actually know its \nobligations. See Kentucky, 67 F.4th at 346; West Virginia, \n59 F.4th at 1144\u201346. ARPA gave $200 billion to states \nwith a significant string attached\u2014the \u201coffset provision.\u201d \nKentucky, 67 F.4th at 328. That provision prohibited \nstates that received ARPA funds from using them to \n\u201cdirectly or indirectly offset a reduction in the[ir] net tax \nrevenue .\u00a0.\u00a0. resulting from\u201d tax cuts. Id. The Sixth Circuit \nheld that the condition itself was clear at the outset\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This aspect of its advocacy is reflected \nin the regular representation of those challenging \ngovernment overreach and other actions in violation of the \nconstitutional framework. See, e.g., Util. Air Regulatory \nGrp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. \nDep\u2019t of Def., 138 S. Ct. 617 (2018). SLF also regularly \nfiles amicus curiae briefs with this Court about issues of \nagency overreach and deference. See, e.g., Kisor v. Wilkie, \n139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019); Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, \n603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nStates possess the inherent sovereign authority to \ndecide with whom they will contract. When Congress \npassed the Medicaid Act, it neither said nor suggested \nthat federal courts, not the State itself, would decide which \nentities were qualified to provide healthcare in that State. \nDespite that, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \nappointed itself arbiter of healthcare qualifications and \nforced South Carolina\u2019s hand by requiring it to subsidize \nPlanned Parenthood with taxpayer money. \n1.\u2002 Rule 37 statement: No party\u2019s counsel authored any of \nthis brief; Amicus alone funded its preparation and submission. \nSee Sup. Ct. R. 37.6.\n\n2\nCongress did not grant the courts that role. Indeed, \nCongress labored to preserve each state\u2019s sovereign \ndiscretion. The Medicaid Act does not confer an individual \nright enforceable in federal court\u2014nor could it do so \nconsistent with our Constitution. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion strays so far from the constitutional order \nbecause of a faulty foundation. This case should prompt \nan originalist examination of the underlying constitutional \nprinciples at issue and the Court should return its \njurisprudence to solid ground once and for all.\nAlthough this case is postured as a Spending Clause \ncase, the Court should begin with an examination of \nthe General Welfare Clause. The former only exists \nbecause of a twisted reading of the latter. The Court\u2019s \njurisprudence will not align with the text, history, and \ntradition of the Constitution until the Court re-examines \nthe General Welfare Clause itself. Tweaking Spending \nClause jurisprudence year after year merely repaints \na constitutional fa\u00e7ade that is built upon a rotting \nfoundation. Current precedent is badly out of step with \nthe original public meaning of the clause, as well as its \nhistory and tradition, and even its plain text. For too long, \nthis misreading of the General Welfare Clause has created \nspending powers divorced from Congress\u2019s enumerated \nlegislative powers. That invention is as atextual as it is \nahistorical. Because an accurate reading of the General \nWelfare Clause would resolve this case, the Court should \ncarefully re-examine its existing jurisprudence. Existing \nprecedent in this area is \u201cegregiously wrong,\u201d and \u201con a \ncollision course with the Constitution from the day it was \ndecided\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Cf. Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., \n597 U.S. 215, 268 (2022). The sooner it is corrected, the \nbetter.\n\n3\nIn the alternative, the Medicaid Act is too ambiguous \nto have created an individual right enforceable under \n\u00a7\u00a0 1983. A long tradition of cases has clarified that \nenactments pursuant to the spending power, like the \nMedicaid Act, must provide clear and unambiguous notice \nto the recipient state of its obligations. That is not so here \nfor two reasons. First, the effect of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nreading of the Act is to transform Medicaid from a state-\nrun system to one where the State can no longer exclude \nparticipants without federal court say-so. And second, \neven if the Act does provide clear notice that it is creating \nan enforceable right, the contours and effect of that right \nare anything but clear. The recipient state must actually \nknow what it is agreeing to. That could not occur here.\nIn either case, this Court should reverse the decision \nof the Fourth Circuit.\nARGUMENT\nI.\t The Court Should Revisit Its Spending Clause \nJurisprudence. \nThis Court\u2019s jurisprudence has for centuries misread \nthe General Welfare Clause to create a spending power. \nThat misreading has been dubbed the Spending Clause. \nNo such clause exists: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power \nTo lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence \nand general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, \nImposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the \nUnited States[.]\u201d U.S. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1. The text \nitself is clear that the second portion of the clause is a \nlimitation on Congress\u2019s power to tax\u2014not a separate \n\n4\npower to spend. This Court\u2019s jurisprudence has strayed \nfar afield from the original meaning.\nThe Court, in recent years, has faithfully worked \nto correct its jurisprudence to reflect the Constitution\u2019s \noriginal public meaning by analyzing its text and history. \nSee, e.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Piston Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. \n1, 22, 24 (2022) (interpreting Second Amendment based \non \u201cconstitutional text and history\u201d); Dobbs, 597 U.S. at \n240; Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 578\u201379 \n(2014); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 595 \n(2008) (\u201cThere seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both \ntext and history, that the Second Amendment conferred \nan individual right to keep and bear arms.\u201d). This work \nhas employed \u201c[a]n analysis focused on original meaning \nand history\u201d as the \u201crule,\u201d not the \u201cexception,\u201d to better \nenforce constitutional provisions as understood by those \nwho enacted them. Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 \nU.S. 507, 536 (2022). This case presents an opportunity \nto continue that work and restore the original meaning \nof the General Welfare Clause.\nOriginalism posits that the meaning of terms is fixed \nat the time of ratification. Lawrence Solum, The Fixation \nThesis: The Role of Historical Fact in Original Meaning, \n91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1, 1\u20132 (2015). It ensures respect \nfor \u201cthe consent of the governed with which the actions \nof the governors must be squared.\u201d Edwin Meese III, \nPerspective on the Authoritativeness of Supreme Court \nDecision: the Law of the Constitution, 61 Tul. L. Rev. 979, \n986 (1987). It excludes the notion that meaning changes \nover time because a democratic society \u201cdoes not, by \nand large, need constitutional guarantees to ensure that \nits laws will reflect \u2018current values.\u2019\u201d Antonin Scalia, \n\n5\nOriginalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849, 862 \n(1989). Originalism, therefore, \u201cfollows inexorably\u201d from \nour commitment to a written constitution. Randy Barnett, \nAn Originalism for Nonoriginalists, 45 Loy. U. L. Rev. \n611, 636 (1999).\nThis contrasts with living constitutionalism, or \u201cthe \ndoctrine that the Constitution should be interpreted \nand applied in accordance with changing circumstances \nand, in particular, with changes in social values.\u201d Living \nConstitutionalism, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Westlaw \n12th ed. 2024). Living constitutionalism \u201callow[s] judges \nto adopt novel constitutional constructions in response to \nchanging values and circumstance.\u201d Randy E. Barnett & \nLawrence B. Solum, Originalism After Dobbs, Bruen, \nand Kennedy: The Role of History and Tradition, 118 Nw. \nU. L. Rev. 433, 451 (2023). Originalists maintain that living \nconstitutionalists (1) subvert the rule of law by permitting \njudges to make constitutional rulings based on their \nsubjective beliefs instead of the fixed meaning of the text;\n(2) undermine the separation of powers by empowering \njudges to make and apply constitutional law instead of \neffecting the meaning of the constitutional text and \npreexisting legal rules; and (3) undermine popular \nsovereignty by elevating the authority of judges over the \npeople\u2019s will as expressed through enacting supermajorities \nor constitutional conventions. Id. at 479\u201380.\nThis Court was presented with an opportunity to \nrevisit its General Welfare Clause jurisprudence with \nan originalist eye in Health & Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski. See 599 U.S. 166, 177\u201380 \n(2023). The majority explained then that \u201csomething \nmore than ambiguous historical evidence is required \n\n6\nbefore we will flatly overrule a number of major decisions \nof this Court.\u201d Id. at 179 (quotation marks omitted). Yet \na thorough review of the evidence shows anything but \nambiguity because both the text and historical record \nsupport only one conclusion: there is no Spending Clause, \nand Congress\u2019s power to spend is a component of the \nnecessary and proper exercise of its enumerated powers. \nThe evidence unambiguously shows that the Constitution \nlimits Congress\u2019s authority to spend to its enumerated \npowers. Congress does not possess an indiscriminate \npower to spend in the name of \u201cgeneral Welfare,\u201d \ndisconnected from its enumerated powers.\nJustice Thomas highlighted that evidence in his \nTalevski dissent. Id. at 206 (Thomas, J., dissenting). And \nalthough he was alone in his dissent, his views on the \ntopic find many allies in the scholarship. See, e.g., Philip \nHamburger, Purchasing Submission 76 (2021); Jeffrey \nT. Renz, What Spending Clause? \u2013 (Or the President\u2019s \nParamour): An Examination of the Views of Hamilton, \nMadison, and Story on Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 \nof the United States Constitution, 33 John Marshall L. \nRev. 81 (1999); David E. Engdahl, The Contract Thesis of \nthe Federal Spending Power, 52 S.D. L. Rev. 496 (2007); \nRobert Natelson, The General Welfare Clause and the \nPublic Trust: An Essay in Original Understanding, \n52 Kan. L. Rev. 1, 23\u201329 (2003). There is a remarkable \nconsensus that the clause limits the taxing power rather \nthan creates an independent power to spend. That \nconsensus comes from not only the text itself, but also \nthe historical record.\nOne compelling anecdote is that of Gouverneur \nMorris\u2019s attempt to shift the meaning of the clause as part \n\n7\nof the Constitutional Convention\u2019s Committee of Style. \nGouverneur Morris was one proponent of giving Congress \na general legislative power. He was not alone. In fact, \nproposals to include a general legislative power failed no \nless than five separate times during the Convention. See \nRenz, 33 John Marshall L. Rev. at 104\u201305 (recounting five \nrejected attempts \u201cto insert a grant of general legislative \npower into the Constitution\u201d).\nAfter these many failed (and well-documented) \nattempts to introduce a general legislative spending power \nopenly, Gouverneur Morris attempted to sneak the power \ninto the Constitution. Id. at 105. He replaced the comma \nafter \u201cExcises\u201d with a semicolon, altering the meaning of \nthe clause to create two separate powers rather than one \nlimited and conjoined power. See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 208 \nn.23 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (recounting this anecdote). \nReplacing the comma with a semicolon created a new \nclause with a standalone power to spend: the power \u201cto \npay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and \ngeneral Welfare of the United States.\u201d See U.S. Const. \nArt. 1, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1. \u201cThe Convention, however, recognized \nthe alteration and restored the comma, \u2018corroborat[ing] \nthe conclusion that the\u00a0General Welfare Clause\u00a0was not \nan independent power.\u2019\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 208 n.23 \n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Natelson, 52 Kan. L. \nRev. at 28).\nAnd the evidence from the Convention does not stand \nalone. Accounts of the time provide further corroboration. \nAs Federalist advocates went out to defend the General \nWelfare Clause to the public, \u201ctheir basic message \nwas that the language in question was not a grant at \nall\u2014rather it was a restriction on federal authority.\u201d \n\n8\nNatelson, 52 Kan. L. Rev. at 39; see also, e.g., 3 Debates \non the Constitution 207 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (E. Randolph, \nVirginia Convention) (\u201cThe plain and obvious meaning of \nthis is, that no more duties, taxes, imposts, and excises, \nshall be laid, than are sufficient to pay the debts, and \nprovide for the common defence and general welfare, of \nthe United States\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Noah Webster, An Examination \nInto the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, \nin Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States 50 \n(P. Ford ed. 1888).\nWhat this demonstrates is that the General Welfare \nClause is not an independent source of federal power, but \na limitation on the taxing power. Although Congress can \ntax, it can only do so for the three listed purposes\u2014debts, \ndefense, and general welfare. That does not mean that \nCongress is empowered to spend on anything it deems \nin the \u201cgeneral Welfare.\u201d Rather, it limits Congress\u2019s \nuse of the taxing power to pay for only those uses of its \nenumerated powers that serve \u201cthe common Defence and \ngeneral Welfare\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1.\nFew said it with more vigor than did Madison in \nFederalist 41:\nSome, who have not denied the necessity of the \npower of taxation, have grounded a very fierce \nattack against the Constitution, on the language \nin which it is defined. It has been urged and \nechoed, that the power \u201cto lay and collect \ntaxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the \ndebts, and provide for the common defense and \ngeneral welfare of the United States,\u201d amounts \nto an unlimited commission to exercise every \n\n9\npower which may be alleged to be necessary \nfor the common defense or general welfare. No \nstronger proof could be given of the distress \nunder which these writers labor for objections, \nthan their stooping to such a misconstruction.\nThe Federalist No. 41, at 262 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Or, \nas Governor Randolph put it, \u201c[y]ou must violate every \nrule of construction and common sense, if you sever it \nfrom the power of raising money, and annex it to anything \nelse, in order to make it that formidable power which it \nis represented to be.\u201d 3 Debates on the Constitution 600. \nThe original public meaning of the clause is in little doubt. \nThat fact alone provides good reason to revise this Court\u2019s \njurisprudence to accord with the Constitution.\nYet another reason exists in how the Court moved \nto the understanding common today. The change was \nhastily penned with cursory reasoning. After laying out \nthe question, the Court explained that,\nWe shall not review the writings of public men \nand commentators or discuss the legislative \npractice. Study of all these leads us to conclude \nthat the reading advocated by Mr. Justice Story \nis the correct one. While, therefore, the power \nto tax is not unlimited, its confines are set in the \nclause which confers it, and not in those of \u00a7\u00a08 \nwhich bestow and define the legislative powers \nof the Congress. It results that the power of \nCongress to authorize expenditure of public \nmoneys for public purposes is not limited by \nthe direct grants of legislative power found in \nthe Constitution.\n\n10\nUnited States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 65\u201366 (1936); see also \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 211\u201319 (Thomas, J., dissenting) \n(providing the historical evolution of the meaning of the \nGeneral Welfare Clause and discussing the transition \nfrom Jefferson and Hamilton\u2019s initial agreement that the \nclause provided no \u201cindependent font of legislative power\u201d \nto the pre-Butler view that it permitted spending but no \nregulation).\nButler\u2019s reasoning is sharply out of alignment with \nthe Court\u2019s jurisprudential focus on the text, history, \nand tradition of the Constitution. The Court should take \nthis opportunity to align its precedent on the General \nWelfare Clause, and thus the ill-conceived doctrine of the \n\u201cSpending Clause,\u201d with the text, history, and original \npublic meaning of the Constitution.\nII.\t The Medicaid Act Does Not Create a Right Even \nUnder Existing Jurisprudence.  \nRevising this Court\u2019s jurisprudence would resolve \nthe present controversy, and the Court should take the \nopportunity not to go further down the wrong path. \nHowever, even under existing precedent, the Medicaid \nAct is too ambiguous to have created a private right of \naction under \u00a7\u00a01983.\nThe Medicaid Act is spending power legislation. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 323 (2015). \u201cThe legitimacy of Congress\u2019 power to \nlegislate under the spending power .\u00a0.\u00a0. rests on whether \nthe State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms \nof the \u2018contract.\u2019\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). Drawing on bedrock \n\n11\ncontract principles, this Court held that the State must \nhave clear notice of the condition. Arlington Cent. Sch. \nDist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).\nSpending enactments fail to provide clear notice when \n(1) the terms are altered from the original enactment \nor (2) as several circuit courts of appeals have held, the \nterms are unclear such that the State would not know its \nobligations. See Nat\u2019l Fed. of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 583 (2012) (NFIB); Kentucky v. Yellen, 67 F.4th \n325, 346 (6th Cir. 2023); West Virginia v. U.S. Dept. of \nthe Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1144\u201346 (11th Cir. 2023). In \nshort, \u201cunless Congress speaks with a clear voice, and \nmanifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual \nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for \nprivate enforcement by \u00a7\u00a01983.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 \nU.S. 273, 280 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThis Court explained in Talevski that this is a firm test. \n599 U.S. at 175. The Medicaid Act fails to provide clear \nnotice of Congress\u2019s unambiguous intent to confer an \nindividual right enforceable under \u00a7\u00a01983 via the Act\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01396a(a)(23).\nNFIB illustrates well the first way a statute can lack \nclear notice. 567 U.S. at 583. The Court squarely rejected \nthe idea that the federal power to compel states using the \nspending power was unlimited. Id. It was critical of the \nAffordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA\u2019s) expansion of the Medicaid \nAct because it was \u201ca shift in kind, not merely degree.\u201d \nId. The ACA \u201ctransformed\u201d Medicaid from a program to \nhelp \u201cthe needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly, and \nneedy families with dependent children .\u00a0.\u00a0. into a program \nto meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly \npopulation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Id. The Medicaid Act\u2019s lone clause that \n\n12\nreserved Congress\u2019s right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the Act \ndid not provide notice of this complete transformation. Id. \nat 584. The upshot is simple: states must be aware at the \noutset what obligations they are accepting.\nRecent cases at the circuit level under the American \nRescue Plan Act (ARPA) illustrate the second point: the \nState must be able to read the terms and actually know its \nobligations. See Kentucky, 67 F.4th at 346; West Virginia, \n59 F.4th at 1144\u201346. ARPA gave $200 billion to states \nwith a significant string attached\u2014the \u201coffset provision.\u201d \nKentucky, 67 F.4th at 328. That provision prohibited \nstates that received ARPA funds from using them to \n\u201cdirectly or indirectly offset a reduction in the[ir] net tax \nrevenue .\u00a0.\u00a0. resulting from\u201d tax cuts. Id. The Sixth Circuit \nheld that the condition itself was clear at the outset, but \nthe obligations it imposed were not. Id. at 346\u201348. The \nquestion was not whether the State knew there was a \ncondition; it was whether the condition was stated in clear \nenough language for the State to know what it had really \nsigned up for. Id. at 346. In other words, the problem was \nthat \u201cwhat this language actually obliges the States to \ndo is difficult to say.\u201d Id. at 348. West Virginia tells the \nsame story and reaches a similar conclusion, as do cases \nin other circuits. See, e.g., 59 F.4th at 1144\u201346; Texas v. \nYellen, 105 F.4th 755 (5th Cir. 2024).\nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision \nfails to provide either kind of clear notice that it is creating \na right enforceable under \u00a7\u00a01983. First, the Medicaid Act \nsets up a system where the recipient state decides what \nproviders are \u201cqualified.\u201d Critically, the Act does not define \n\u201cqualified.\u201d It reserves to recipient states the authority to \nexclude providers for the same reasons the Secretary of \n\n13\nHealth and Human Services can exclude providers from \nMedicare. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01396a(p)(1). And this authority \nto exclude is in addition to the recipient state\u2019s inherent, \nretained authority to decide which entities to contract \nwith. See id.\nThe Medicaid Act offered a bargain in which the \nrecipient state decides what providers it will work \nwith. Interpreting the bargain as the Fourth Circuit \ndid and allowing courts, not the States, to decide what \nproviders are qualified is not a minor shift in terms\u2014it \nis a transformation. The Medicaid Act promised a state-\noperated system where the recipient states retain their \nsovereignty to decide with whom to contract. Interpreting \nthe any-qualified-provider provision to confer an \nindividual and enforceable right is directly contrary to \nthe bargain struck. As in NFIB, the bargain may be \naltered, not transformed, and this would effect a radical \ntransformation.\nSecond, even if the Act did provide clear notice that \nit was creating an individual and enforceable right, the \neffect of that right is as clear as mud. The Act itself \nprovides no definition of \u201cqualified.\u201d The original Fourth \nCircuit opinion in this case held that to mean that it \u201cbars \nstates from excluding providers for reasons unrelated to \nprofessional competency.\u201d Planned Parenthood S. Atl. \nv. Baker, 941 F.3d 687, 691 (4th Cir. 2019) (subsequent \nprocedural history omitted). Yet it is unclear how the \nState, when considering the bargain, would have come \nto that conclusion independently. States are sovereign \nentities with myriad interests to protect.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape in this case remains stable, as the latest observation was an internal thought process rather than new external evidence. The core of my belief structure is unchanged.\n\nThe central legal question is whether the Medicaid Act's \"free-choice-of-provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) unambiguously creates a private right of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983. My analysis is built upon the competing interpretations of this provision in light of the Supreme Court's recent, stricter jurisprudence on implied rights of action.\n\nMy model of the petitioner's (South Carolina's) case is well-defined, based on their merits brief. They argue that the statutory language is directed at the state's obligations in creating its Medicaid plan, not at conferring an individual entitlement. This argument is rooted in the framework established by *Gonzaga v. Doe* and recently applied in *Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion Cty. v. Talevski*, suggesting that for a right to be privately enforceable, the text must have an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\" The petitioner contends this standard is not met and that the existence of an administrative remedial scheme for providers further counsels against implying a private right for beneficiaries.\n\nMy understanding of the respondents' (Planned Parenthood's) position is based on their Brief in Opposition to certiorari. This document argues that the provision's language\u2014stating that \"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\" from any qualified provider\u2014is the exact kind of \"rights-creating\" language that *Gonzaga* and *Talevski* require. They interpret *Talevski* as a reaffirmation of this principle and distinguish the beneficiary's right to choose from a provider's separate right to participate, arguing the remedies are not interchangeable.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014an internal monologue about the search for the respondents' merits brief\u2014provides no new substantive information about the case. It does not alter my understanding of the legal arguments, precedents, or facts. Instead, it serves a procedural function: it confirms with high certainty that a key piece of evidence I had previously identified as missing\u2014the respondents' full merits brief\u2014is indeed still absent from my knowledge base. This reinforces my prior belief that my model of the respondents' case is provisional and based on a document (the Brief in Opposition) with a different strategic purpose than a final merits brief. My current beliefs about the legal clash are therefore stable, and my confidence in a final prediction remains moderated pending the acquisition of this crucial document.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal arguments in this case has been significantly expanded by the observation of an amicus brief from the Southeastern Legal Foundation (SLF) in support of the petitioner, South Carolina. While my prior beliefs about the core legal conflict remain stable, this new evidence introduces a new and more radical line of argumentation that could influence the Court's decision, and it refines the petitioner's existing arguments.\n\nMy prior model was centered on the direct clash over the interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) through the lens of the Court's precedents on implied rights of action, specifically the tension between the strict \"unmistakable focus\" test from *Gonzaga v. Doe* and the more recent application in *Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion Cty. v. Talevski*. The petitioner's case, as I understood it from their merits brief, focused on arguing that the statute's language is directed at the state's plan, not the individual beneficiary, and that an administrative remedial scheme precludes a private one. The respondents' case, based on their brief in opposition, centered on the argument that the statute's text is precisely the kind of \"rights-creating\" language *Talevski* affirmed.\n\nThe SLF amicus brief adds two powerful, distinct arguments in favor of the petitioner, providing the Court with multiple pathways to reverse the Fourth Circuit:\n\n1.  **A Fundamental Constitutional Challenge to Spending Clause Jurisprudence:** The most significant new information is the brief's primary argument that the Court should use this case to conduct an originalist re-examination of its entire Spending Clause doctrine. The SLF argues there is no independent \"Spending Clause,\" but rather that the General Welfare Clause (Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1) is a *limitation* on Congress's taxing power, not a grant of a separate power to spend. This argument, which heavily cites Justice Thomas's dissent in *Talevski* and originalist scholarship, posits that Congress can only spend in furtherance of its other enumerated powers. By framing current precedent as \"egregiously wrong\" and on a \"collision course with the Constitution\"\u2014language that directly echoes the majority opinion in *Dobbs*\u2014the brief is explicitly inviting the Court's conservative wing to make a landmark constitutional ruling that would dramatically curtail federal spending power. This introduces the possibility of a much broader, more consequential outcome than I had previously considered.\n\n2.  **A Refined Statutory Argument Under Existing Precedent:** As a fallback, the SLF brief sharpens the petitioner's statutory argument by linking the \"clear notice\" requirement from *Pennhurst* and *Gonzaga* to the \"shift in kind, not merely degree\" analysis from *NFIB v. Sebelius*. The brief contends that allowing a private right of action for beneficiaries to challenge a state's provider qualifications would transform Medicaid from a state-administered program into one where federal courts dictate qualification standards. This, they argue, is a fundamental transformation that states did not have \"clear notice\" of when they accepted Medicaid funds. This line of reasoning provides a powerful, contract-based argument for why, even if the text seems to focus on the beneficiary, it cannot be read to create an enforceable right without violating the clear-notice principle that undergirds all Spending Clause legislation.\n\nThis observation has updated my beliefs by expanding the set of potential arguments that could persuade the Court to rule for the petitioner. It signals that conservative legal advocates see this case as a vehicle for a major originalist project, targeting justices like Thomas, Gorsuch, and Alito. My model of the petitioner's case is now more robust, containing both a narrow, precedent-based path to victory and a broad, constitutionally revolutionary one. My uncertainty about the final outcome now includes not just *who* will win, but also the *scope* of a potential ruling for the petitioner. My understanding of the respondents' full argument remains provisional, as their merits brief is still a critical missing piece of evidence.",

It will dramatically reduce my uncertainty and allow me to move from a biased, one-sided view to a more balanced and informed prediction. The Design EIG is also significant (0.6) because it validates and calibrates a core principle of legal prediction: one must always analyze the arguments from both sides of an adversarial proceeding.

Substantial federal \nfunding supports the Medicaid program.  The statute \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nreview and approve state Medicaid plans if they comply \nwith federal requirements including Section 1396a(a)(23), \nand to withhold federal funding if States fail to comply \nsubstantially with those requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396-1, 1396a(b), 1396c.  The United States has a substan-\ntial interest in the manner in which Section 1396a(a)(23) \nis enforced. \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n Section 1983 is a landmark civil-rights law that ena-\nbles private plaintiffs to sue state actors for violating \n\u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of \nthe United States.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  But, as this Court re-\ncently emphasized, federal-law guarantees do not sup-\nport Section 1983 suits \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d  Health \n& Hosp. Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n166, 183 (2023).  Only provisions of federal law that \u201cun-\nambiguously secure[]\u201d individual rights presumptively \ntrigger Section 1983 suits, lest courts trench on Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional role in creating causes of action.  \nSee id. at 186.  Even then, express or implicit signs that \n\u201cCongress did not intend\u201d to allow for Section 1983 en-\nforcement can defeat \u201cunambiguous[]\u201d rights-securing \nprovisions.  Ibid. (citation omitted). \n \nSpending Clause legislation \u201cin particular\u201d must over-\ncome a \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183, \n184.  Congress expected that \u201cthe typical remedy for \nstate noncompliance\u201d with such legislation would be for \n\u201cthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState,\u201d not for private plaintiffs to bring Section 1983 \nsuits.  Id. at 183 (citation omitted).  And States assume \nnew responsibilities by accepting federal funds only  \nif they received clear notice of the terms of the federal-\nState bargain, including the prospect of Section 1983 lit-\nigation.   \n \nTalevski clarified just how high the bar for Spending \nClause legislation is.  There, this Court relied on multi-\nple statutory indicia to identify provisions of the Fed-\neral Nursing Home Reform Act as the kind of unmis-\ntakable standouts that can sustain Section 1983 suits.  \nCongress collected those provisions in a subsection ded-\nicated to \u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d  \n\n3 \n \n42 U.S.C. 1396r(c).  Congress reiterated that those  \nprovisions concerned specific \u201crights\u201d for individual \nnursing-home residents to be free from unnecessary re-\nstraints and improper discharges.  Congress added nu-\nmerous details associated with individual residents\u2019 \nhealth and medical needs.  And Congress provided that \nthe statutory enforcement remedies were \u201cin addition \nto\u201d other state and federal remedies, not limitations on \nthem.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(8).  Since 1990, those are the \nonly Spending Clause provisions that this Court has \nheld create rights actionable under Section 1983.  \nCourts should \u201ctread carefully\u201d before finding more.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 195 (Barrett, J., concurring). \n \nTalevski makes clear that the Medicaid provision at \nissue\u2014the so-called any-qualified-provider provision, \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)\u2014is the non-actionable rule, not \na special rights-creating exception.  Congress included \nthat provision alongside 86 others in an undifferentiated \nlist describing the \u201c[c]ontents\u201d that \u201c[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d provide.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).  \nCongress sandwiched Section 1396a(a)(23) between a \nprovision that tells States how to describe medical  \npersonnel involved in plan administration and one  \nmandating consultative services for healthcare provid-\ners.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(22) and (24).  And Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) lacks the sort of unmistakable, repeat \nreferences to \u201crights\u201d and individual conditions that the \nCourt relied on in Talevski.  The provision simply in-\nstructs State plans to \u201cprovide that (A) any individual \neligible for medical assistance  * * *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  * * *  qualified\u201d to pro-\nvide it.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23). \n \nCongress did not put States on notice that Section \n1396a(a)(23) would expose them to potential Section \n\n4 \n \n1983 liability by burying a special, privately enforceable \nright deep within Section 1396a(a) and failing to use  \nthe term \u201cright\u201d or other equally unmistakable rights-\nconferring language.  Indeed, Section 1396a(a)(23) \nuses garden-variety Spending Clause language.  Mis-\nclassifying it as a rights-creating rara avis would thus \ninvite private enforcement of numerous Spending \nClause statutes\u2014exactly what this Court has warned \nagainst. \n \nThe United States previously advanced a different \nview of Section 1396a(a)(23).  In a footnote in the amicus \nbrief it filed in this Court in Talevski and in several ami-\ncus briefs in courts of appeals, the United States con-\ntended that the any-qualified-provider provision cre-\nates a right enforceable under Section 1983.1  But Talev-\nski has elucidated just how unmistakable and unusual \nrights-conferring statutes must be within the broader \nstatutory context.  After the change in Administration \nand in light of Talevski, the United States has con-\ncluded that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not create Section \n1983-enforceable rights.  Any contrary reading of Sec-\ntion 1396a(a)(23) would contravene Talevski\u2019s admoni-\ntions about the rarity of rights-creating language and \npotentially greenlight private Section 1983 suits to en-\nforce a dozen or more similar provisions. \n \n1 U.S. Amicus Br. at 22 n.5, Talevski, supra (No. 21-806); U.S. \nAmicus Br. at 7-9, Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v.

Like all Spending Clause legislation, the federal \nMedicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., is a bargain be-\ntween Congress and the States.  Since 1965, Congress \nhas agreed to provide funding to the States for health \ncare for low-income individuals.  In exchange for federal \nfunding, participating States must comply with certain \nfederal requirements.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015).  Specifically, a \nState must receive the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices\u2019 approval of a \u201cState plan for medical assis-\ntance\u201d detailing the nature and scope of the State\u2019s \nMedicaid plan.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A) and (b).   \n \nSection 1396a of the Medicaid statute comprehen-\nsively lists federal requirements for state Medicaid \nplans.  Section 1396a(a)\u2014entitled \u201cContents\u201d\u2014describes \nwhat a state plan \u201cmust\u201d provide to obtain federal ap-\nproval.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) and (b).  Section 1396a(a) alone \nincludes 87 detailed paragraphs that span over 15 pages \nof the U.S. Code, many of which include their own highly \nreticulated subparagraphs.  Those 87 paragraphs address \neverything from general record-keeping practices to \nthe manner of administering examinations for blind-\nness.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(4) and (12).   \n \nThe Secretary reviews the State\u2019s plan (and any sub-\nsequent amendments) for compliance with federal re-\nquirements.  42 U.S.C. 1316(a)(1) and (b), 1396a(b); 42 \nC.F.R. 430.10 et seq.  Even after approval, the Secretary \n(through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-\nvices) can review the administration of state Medicaid \nplans \u201cto determine whether the State is complying \nwith the Federal requirements and the provisions of its \nplan.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 430.32(a).   \n\n6 \n \n \nThe statute and federal regulations provide for sev-\neral enforcement mechanisms.  If a State \u201cfail[s] to com-\nply substantially with any such provision\u201d of Section \n1396a in administering its plan, the Secretary \u201cshall \nmake no further payments to such State\u201d until he is sat-\nisfied that the State has returned to compliance.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396c(2).  By regulation, States must create ad-\nministrative procedures for Medicaid providers to bring \ncertain challenges.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  And \nStates must create hearing systems through which in-\ndividuals can bring challenges relating to their claims \nfor eligibility or covered benefits under the plan.  See \n42 C.F.R. 431.201, 431.220. \n \nThis case concerns Section 1396a(a)\u2019s twenty-third \nsubsection, often called the \u201cany-qualified-provider\u201d \nprovision or the \u201cfree-choice-of-provider\u201d provision.  \nSee Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Family Plan-\nning & Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, \n981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc).  Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) states: \n\u201cA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible for med-\nical assistance  * * *  may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution, agency, community pharmacy, \nor person, qualified to perform the service or ser-\nvices required  * * *  who undertakes to provide him \nsuch services.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).  The statute does not define \nthe word \u201cqualified.\u201d  Longstanding federal regula-\ntions, however, recognize States\u2019 authority to \u201cset[]  \nreasonable standards relating to the qualifications of \nproviders.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 431.51(c)(2); see 43 Fed. Reg. \n\n7 \n \n45,176, 45,189 (Sept. 29, 1978).  The final lines of Section \n1396a(a)(23) state that States need not provide pay-\nments to providers with certain felony convictions.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23).  And a separate provision contem-\nplates that \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority, a \nState may exclude\u201d any provider from Medicaid for cer-\ntain reasons \u201cfor which the Secretary could exclude\u201d  \nthe provider from participating in Medicare.  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(p)(1) (emphasis added).   \n \n2. Respondent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic \noperates two clinics in South Carolina, at which it per-\nforms abortions.  Pet. App. 6a.  Planned Parenthood \nalso provides other services at those two clinics, includ-\ning contraceptive counseling and screenings for sex-\nually transmitted infections.  Ibid.  Before 2018, South \nCarolina\u2019s Medicaid program covered non-abortion ser-\nvices at Planned Parenthood.  Id. at 6a-7a.2   \n \nOn July 13, 2018, the Governor of South Carolina is-\nsued an executive order directing the State\u2019s Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services to:  (1) deem all \nabortion clinics enrolled in the state Medicaid program \n\u201cunqualified\u201d to provide any family-planning services; \n(2) \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d their enrollment in the pro-\ngram; and (3) deny any future enrollment applications \nthat they might submit.  Pet. App. 157a-159a.  The order \nrelied on a South Carolina law prohibiting the use of \nstate funds to pay for abortions, explaining that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \n \n2  Under the Hyde Amendment, federal Medicaid funds cannot be \n\u201cexpended for any abortion,\u201d except in the case of rape or incest or \nto save the life of the mother.

Pet. App. 161a-162a.  Pursuant to the executive \norder, the State determined Planned Parenthood \u201cno \nlonger [to be] qualified to provide services to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Id. at 162a. \n \n3. a. Respondents Planned Parenthood South At-\nlantic and Julie Edwards, a Planned Parenthood patient \ncovered by Medicaid, sued South Carolina\u2019s Director of \nHealth and Human Services under 42 U.S.C. 1983, seek-\ning declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pet. App. 128a-\n129a.  Section 1983, however, supplies a private right  \nof action only for plaintiffs who have been deprived  \nof \u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  Respondents identified 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23) as the source of their putative federal right, \ncontending that by terminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nparticipation as a provider in the State\u2019s Medicaid pro-\ngram, South Carolina abridged Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 \nright to obtain care from the \u201cqualified\u201d provider of \ntheir choice.  Pet. App. 130a.   \n \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 146a.  The court first held that Section 1983 \nprovides a private right of action for individual Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries to enforce the any-qualified-provider \nprovision.  Id. at 132a-136a.  The court explained that \nonly federal statutes that confer \u201ca federal right, not \nsimply a benefit or interest,\u201d are enforceable via Section \n1983.  Id. at 133a.  The court concluded that the any-\nqualified-provider provision \u201cunambiguously confers a \n\n9 \n \nright upon Medicaid-eligible patients\u201d like respondent \nEdwards to \u201cobtain assistance from any qualified and \nwilling provider.\u201d  Id. at 134a.3  The court further held \nthat South Carolina likely abridged that right by termi-\nnating Planned Parenthood\u2019s participation as a Medi-\ncaid program provider.  Id. at 138a-141a. \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  \nThe court analyzed the right-of-action question by apply-\ning the three factors this Court articulated in Blessing \nv. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-341 (1997).  Pet. App. \n95a-98a.  The court of appeals determined that Edwards \nhad a right to sue because the any-qualified-provider \nprovision (1) has an \u201cunmistakable focus\u201d on Medicaid-\neligible individuals; (2) is not too \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d \nfor courts to assess; and (3\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Substantial federal \nfunding supports the Medicaid program.  The statute \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nreview and approve state Medicaid plans if they comply \nwith federal requirements including Section 1396a(a)(23), \nand to withhold federal funding if States fail to comply \nsubstantially with those requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396-1, 1396a(b), 1396c.  The United States has a substan-\ntial interest in the manner in which Section 1396a(a)(23) \nis enforced. \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n Section 1983 is a landmark civil-rights law that ena-\nbles private plaintiffs to sue state actors for violating \n\u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of \nthe United States.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  But, as this Court re-\ncently emphasized, federal-law guarantees do not sup-\nport Section 1983 suits \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d  Health \n& Hosp. Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n166, 183 (2023).  Only provisions of federal law that \u201cun-\nambiguously secure[]\u201d individual rights presumptively \ntrigger Section 1983 suits, lest courts trench on Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional role in creating causes of action.  \nSee id. at 186.  Even then, express or implicit signs that \n\u201cCongress did not intend\u201d to allow for Section 1983 en-\nforcement can defeat \u201cunambiguous[]\u201d rights-securing \nprovisions.  Ibid. (citation omitted). \n \nSpending Clause legislation \u201cin particular\u201d must over-\ncome a \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183, \n184.  Congress expected that \u201cthe typical remedy for \nstate noncompliance\u201d with such legislation would be for \n\u201cthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState,\u201d not for private plaintiffs to bring Section 1983 \nsuits.  Id. at 183 (citation omitted).  And States assume \nnew responsibilities by accepting federal funds only  \nif they received clear notice of the terms of the federal-\nState bargain, including the prospect of Section 1983 lit-\nigation.   \n \nTalevski clarified just how high the bar for Spending \nClause legislation is.  There, this Court relied on multi-\nple statutory indicia to identify provisions of the Fed-\neral Nursing Home Reform Act as the kind of unmis-\ntakable standouts that can sustain Section 1983 suits.  \nCongress collected those provisions in a subsection ded-\nicated to \u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d  \n\n3 \n \n42 U.S.C. 1396r(c).  Congress reiterated that those  \nprovisions concerned specific \u201crights\u201d for individual \nnursing-home residents to be free from unnecessary re-\nstraints and improper discharges.  Congress added nu-\nmerous details associated with individual residents\u2019 \nhealth and medical needs.  And Congress provided that \nthe statutory enforcement remedies were \u201cin addition \nto\u201d other state and federal remedies, not limitations on \nthem.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(8).  Since 1990, those are the \nonly Spending Clause provisions that this Court has \nheld create rights actionable under Section 1983.  \nCourts should \u201ctread carefully\u201d before finding more.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 195 (Barrett, J., concurring). \n \nTalevski makes clear that the Medicaid provision at \nissue\u2014the so-called any-qualified-provider provision, \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)\u2014is the non-actionable rule, not \na special rights-creating exception.  Congress included \nthat provision alongside 86 others in an undifferentiated \nlist describing the \u201c[c]ontents\u201d that \u201c[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d provide.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).  \nCongress sandwiched Section 1396a(a)(23) between a \nprovision that tells States how to describe medical  \npersonnel involved in plan administration and one  \nmandating consultative services for healthcare provid-\ners.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(22) and (24).  And Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) lacks the sort of unmistakable, repeat \nreferences to \u201crights\u201d and individual conditions that the \nCourt relied on in Talevski.  The provision simply in-\nstructs State plans to \u201cprovide that (A) any individual \neligible for medical assistance  * * *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  * * *  qualified\u201d to pro-\nvide it.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23). \n \nCongress did not put States on notice that Section \n1396a(a)(23) would expose them to potential Section \n\n4 \n \n1983 liability by burying a special, privately enforceable \nright deep within Section 1396a(a) and failing to use  \nthe term \u201cright\u201d or other equally unmistakable rights-\nconferring language.  Indeed, Section 1396a(a)(23) \nuses garden-variety Spending Clause language.  Mis-\nclassifying it as a rights-creating rara avis would thus \ninvite private enforcement of numerous Spending \nClause statutes\u2014exactly what this Court has warned \nagainst. \n \nThe United States previously advanced a different \nview of Section 1396a(a)(23).  In a footnote in the amicus \nbrief it filed in this Court in Talevski and in several ami-\ncus briefs in courts of appeals, the United States con-\ntended that the any-qualified-provider provision cre-\nates a right enforceable under Section 1983.1  But Talev-\nski has elucidated just how unmistakable and unusual \nrights-conferring statutes must be within the broader \nstatutory context.  After the change in Administration \nand in light of Talevski, the United States has con-\ncluded that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not create Section \n1983-enforceable rights.  Any contrary reading of Sec-\ntion 1396a(a)(23) would contravene Talevski\u2019s admoni-\ntions about the rarity of rights-creating language and \npotentially greenlight private Section 1983 suits to en-\nforce a dozen or more similar provisions. \n \n1 U.S. Amicus Br. at 22 n.5, Talevski, supra (No. 21-806); U.S. \nAmicus Br. at 7-9, Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v.

Like all Spending Clause legislation, the federal \nMedicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., is a bargain be-\ntween Congress and the States.  Since 1965, Congress \nhas agreed to provide funding to the States for health \ncare for low-income individuals.  In exchange for federal \nfunding, participating States must comply with certain \nfederal requirements.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015).  Specifically, a \nState must receive the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices\u2019 approval of a \u201cState plan for medical assis-\ntance\u201d detailing the nature and scope of the State\u2019s \nMedicaid plan.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A) and (b).   \n \nSection 1396a of the Medicaid statute comprehen-\nsively lists federal requirements for state Medicaid \nplans.  Section 1396a(a)\u2014entitled \u201cContents\u201d\u2014describes \nwhat a state plan \u201cmust\u201d provide to obtain federal ap-\nproval.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) and (b).  Section 1396a(a) alone \nincludes 87 detailed paragraphs that span over 15 pages \nof the U.S. Code, many of which include their own highly \nreticulated subparagraphs.  Those 87 paragraphs address \neverything from general record-keeping practices to \nthe manner of administering examinations for blind-\nness.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(4) and (12).   \n \nThe Secretary reviews the State\u2019s plan (and any sub-\nsequent amendments) for compliance with federal re-\nquirements.  42 U.S.C. 1316(a)(1) and (b), 1396a(b); 42 \nC.F.R. 430.10 et seq.  Even after approval, the Secretary \n(through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-\nvices) can review the administration of state Medicaid \nplans \u201cto determine whether the State is complying \nwith the Federal requirements and the provisions of its \nplan.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 430.32(a).   \n\n6 \n \n \nThe statute and federal regulations provide for sev-\neral enforcement mechanisms.  If a State \u201cfail[s] to com-\nply substantially with any such provision\u201d of Section \n1396a in administering its plan, the Secretary \u201cshall \nmake no further payments to such State\u201d until he is sat-\nisfied that the State has returned to compliance.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396c(2).  By regulation, States must create ad-\nministrative procedures for Medicaid providers to bring \ncertain challenges.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  And \nStates must create hearing systems through which in-\ndividuals can bring challenges relating to their claims \nfor eligibility or covered benefits under the plan.  See \n42 C.F.R. 431.201, 431.220. \n \nThis case concerns Section 1396a(a)\u2019s twenty-third \nsubsection, often called the \u201cany-qualified-provider\u201d \nprovision or the \u201cfree-choice-of-provider\u201d provision.  \nSee Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Family Plan-\nning & Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, \n981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc).  Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) states: \n\u201cA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible for med-\nical assistance  * * *  may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution, agency, community pharmacy, \nor person, qualified to perform the service or ser-\nvices required  * * *  who undertakes to provide him \nsuch services.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).  The statute does not define \nthe word \u201cqualified.\u201d  Longstanding federal regula-\ntions, however, recognize States\u2019 authority to \u201cset[]  \nreasonable standards relating to the qualifications of \nproviders.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 431.51(c)(2); see 43 Fed. Reg. \n\n7 \n \n45,176, 45,189 (Sept. 29, 1978).  The final lines of Section \n1396a(a)(23) state that States need not provide pay-\nments to providers with certain felony convictions.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23).  And a separate provision contem-\nplates that \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority, a \nState may exclude\u201d any provider from Medicaid for cer-\ntain reasons \u201cfor which the Secretary could exclude\u201d  \nthe provider from participating in Medicare.  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(p)(1) (emphasis added).   \n \n2. Respondent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic \noperates two clinics in South Carolina, at which it per-\nforms abortions.  Pet. App. 6a.  Planned Parenthood \nalso provides other services at those two clinics, includ-\ning contraceptive counseling and screenings for sex-\nually transmitted infections.  Ibid.  Before 2018, South \nCarolina\u2019s Medicaid program covered non-abortion ser-\nvices at Planned Parenthood.  Id. at 6a-7a.2   \n \nOn July 13, 2018, the Governor of South Carolina is-\nsued an executive order directing the State\u2019s Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services to:  (1) deem all \nabortion clinics enrolled in the state Medicaid program \n\u201cunqualified\u201d to provide any family-planning services; \n(2) \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d their enrollment in the pro-\ngram; and (3) deny any future enrollment applications \nthat they might submit.  Pet. App. 157a-159a.  The order \nrelied on a South Carolina law prohibiting the use of \nstate funds to pay for abortions, explaining that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \n \n2  Under the Hyde Amendment, federal Medicaid funds cannot be \n\u201cexpended for any abortion,\u201d except in the case of rape or incest or \nto save the life of the mother.  Further Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, Tit. V, \u00a7\u00a7 506-507, 138 Stat. 703. \n\n8 \n \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d  Id. at 157a-158a (citing S.C. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185 (2015)). \n \nThe South Carolina Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services implemented the executive order by im-\nmediately terminating respondent Planned Parenthood \nSouth Atlantic\u2019s enrollment in the State\u2019s Medicaid pro-\ngram.  Pet. App. 161a-162a.  Pursuant to the executive \norder, the State determined Planned Parenthood \u201cno \nlonger [to be] qualified to provide services to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Id. at 162a. \n \n3. a. Respondents Planned Parenthood South At-\nlantic and Julie Edwards, a Planned Parenthood patient \ncovered by Medicaid, sued South Carolina\u2019s Director of \nHealth and Human Services under 42 U.S.C. 1983, seek-\ning declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pet. App. 128a-\n129a.  Section 1983, however, supplies a private right  \nof action only for plaintiffs who have been deprived  \nof \u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  Respondents identified 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23) as the source of their putative federal right, \ncontending that by terminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nparticipation as a provider in the State\u2019s Medicaid pro-\ngram, South Carolina abridged Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 \nright to obtain care from the \u201cqualified\u201d provider of \ntheir choice.  Pet. App. 130a.   \n \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 146a.  The court first held that Section 1983 \nprovides a private right of action for individual Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries to enforce the any-qualified-provider \nprovision.  Id. at 132a-136a.  The court explained that \nonly federal statutes that confer \u201ca federal right, not \nsimply a benefit or interest,\u201d are enforceable via Section \n1983.  Id. at 133a.  The court concluded that the any-\nqualified-provider provision \u201cunambiguously confers a \n\n9 \n \nright upon Medicaid-eligible patients\u201d like respondent \nEdwards to \u201cobtain assistance from any qualified and \nwilling provider.\u201d  Id. at 134a.3  The court further held \nthat South Carolina likely abridged that right by termi-\nnating Planned Parenthood\u2019s participation as a Medi-\ncaid program provider.  Id. at 138a-141a. \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  \nThe court analyzed the right-of-action question by apply-\ning the three factors this Court articulated in Blessing \nv. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-341 (1997).  Pet. App. \n95a-98a.  The court of appeals determined that Edwards \nhad a right to sue because the any-qualified-provider \nprovision (1) has an \u201cunmistakable focus\u201d on Medicaid-\neligible individuals; (2) is not too \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d \nfor courts to assess; and (3) imposes a \u201cmandatory\u201d ob-\nligation on States.  Ibid. (citations omitted).  The court \nalso affirmed the district court\u2019s holding that respond-\nents were likely to succeed on the merits of their under-\nlying claim.  Id. at 106a-117a.   \n \nJudge Richardson concurred separately to urge this \nCourt to clarify the appropriate framework for deter-\nmining whether statutory requirements are enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 120a-125a. \nb. While petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas pending, the district court granted summary judg-\nment to respondents.  Pet. App. 68a-79a.  The court re-\niterated its conclusion that Edwards has a right of ac-\ntion under Section 1983 to enforce the any-qualified-\nprovider provision, and it ruled for respondents on the \nmerits of their claim.  Id. at 74a-79a.  After this Court \n \n3 The district court did not consider, and respondents have not \npressed, an argument that providers like respondent Planned \nParenthood have a right of action under Section 1983 to enforce the \nany-qualified-provider provision. \n\n10 \n \ndenied petitioner\u2019s pending petition for a writ of certio-\nrari, 141 S. Ct. 550, the district court entered a perma-\nnent injunction.  Pet. App. 66a-67a. \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the permanent injunc-\ntion.  Pet. App. 38a-65a.  The court rejected petitioner\u2019s \nrequest to reconsider its prior holding that Edwards \nhas a right of action under Section 1983.  Id. at 51a-64a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment, asking \nanew for this Court to clarify the proper framework for \ndeciding enforceability under Section 1983.  Id. at 65a. \n \nc. While petitioner\u2019s second petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was pending, this Court decided Health & \nHospital Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n166 (2023), which clarified the proper framework for de-\nciding whether a statute creates individual rights that \nare privately enforceable under Section 1983.  Talevski, \nhowever, addressed provisions of the Federal Nursing \nHome Reform Act, not the Medicaid provisions at issue \nhere.  This Court then granted the pending petition \nfiled by petitioner in this case, vacated the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision, and remanded for further proceedings \nin light of Talevski.  143 S. Ct. 2633. \n \nd. After additional briefing and argument, the court \nof appeals again affirmed the district court\u2019s permanent \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 1a-36a.  The court of appeals con-\ncluded that \u201cTalevski did not change the law to an ex-\ntent that would call [its] previous determinations into \nquestion.\u201d  Id. at 12a.  The court then analyzed Section \n1396a(a)(23) \u201cto determine whether it \u2018unambiguously \ncreates \u00a7 1983-enforceable rights.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 24a (quoting \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 172) (brackets omitted).  The court \ndetermined that Section 1396a(a)(23) does create such a \nright, relying on its references to \u201cany individual\u201d and \n\n11 \n \nthe entities that provide \u201chim\u201d with services.  Id. at 25a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)) (emphasis omitted). \n \nThe court of appeals rejected petitioner\u2019s contrary \narguments.  First, the court dismissed the argument \nthat \u201cthe word \u2018right\u2019 cannot be found\u201d in the statutory \ntext, stating that \u201c\u200a\u2018magic words\u2019\u200a\u201d are not required.  Pet. \nApp. 26a (quoting FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012)).  Second, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s argu-\nment that Section 1396a(a)(23) is not sufficiently fo-\ncused on individual rights because it is part of a list of \nstate-plan requirements.  Id. at 27a-29a.  The court \nnoted that this Court \u201chas already held that a different \nfunding condition enumerated in \u00a7 1396a(a) confers in-\ndividual rights enforceable\u201d under Section 1983.  Id. at \n27a (citing Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. \n498, 509-510 (1990)).  The court of appeals also noted \nthat in a separate provision, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2, Con-\ngress \u201crejected the view that its inclusion of an individ-\nual right in a list of requirements for a state plan\u201d pre-\ncludes the possibility of enforcement under Section \n1983.  Id. at 29a.  Third, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s \nargument that the provision is not focused on individual \nrights because a State need only \u201ccomply substantially\u201d \nto avoid the withholding of federal funding.  Id. at 29a-\n31a.  The court noted that both Wilder and Talevski \nconcerned substantial-compliance regimes.  Ibid.  Peti-\ntioner did not reraise, and the court thus did not revisit, \nits previous holding that respondents prevailed on the \nmerits of their claim because Planned Parenthood is a \n\u201cqualified\u201d provider. \n \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment, ex-\nplaining that although \u201cTalevski suggests a different \npath\u201d from Wilder, he was \u201cbound to stand by\u201d the court \nof appeals\u2019 \u201cprevious holding.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a-36a. \n\n12 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. In the past 40 years, this Court has found Spend-\ning Clause provisions to be sufficiently clear to create \nfederally enforceable rights under Section 1983 only \nthree times.  See Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion County \nv. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023); Wilder v. Virginia \nHosp. Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. 498 (1990); Wright v. City of Roa-\nnoke Redevelopment & Hous. Auth., 479 U.S. 418 (1987).  \nThe any-qualified-provider provision of the Medicaid \nstatute, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), does not fit the mold, \nand it cannot be privately enforced through Section \n1983 suits. \nA. Section 1983 enables private plaintiffs to sue state \nactors for violations of \u201crights\u201d conferred by federal \nlaws.  But federal laws do not ordinarily create Section \n1983-enforceable rights.  Only the rare statutory provi-\nsions that \u201cunambiguously\u201d confer individual rights are \nprivately enforceable under Section 1983\u2014and then, \nonly if there are no countervailing signs that Congress \nsought to rule out Section 1983 suits.  Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002).  Spending Clause statutes \nface a particularly \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 184.  Because the typical remedy for States\u2019 non-\ncompliance with Spending Clause statutory require-\nments is the withholding of federal funding, this Court \nis especially loath to infer that such provisions confer \nprivately enforceable rights.  That \u201cunambiguous con-\nferral\u201d requirement respects federalism interests that \nloom large in Spending Clause legislation, where States \nmust be on clear notice of the conditions they agree to \nshoulder in exchange for federal funds.  Requiring un-\nmistakable evidence that Congress intended to create \nSection 1983-enforceable rights also guards against ju-\ndicial encroachment into Congress\u2019s rights-creating \n\n13 \n \nrole, and prevents private plaintiffs from displacing the \nExecutive as the primary enforcers of Spending Clause \nlaws. \nThis Court\u2019s precedents offer guideposts about what \nfeatures of Spending Clause provisions can clear the \nstringent rights-creating bar.  In Talevski, this Court \nheld that a nursing-home-specific law within the Medi-\ncaid statute conferred Section 1983-enforceable rights \nbecause Congress created a separate statutory section \nfocused on \u201crights,\u201d and repeatedly referred to nursing-\nhome \u201cresidents\u201d and their \u201crights\u201d in the provisions at \nissue.  By contrast, provisions setting out generalized \npolicies with which entities must comply to receive fed-\neral funding do not unambiguously create individual \nrights.  \nB. Applying these precepts, Section 1396a(a)(23) \ndoes not unambiguously confer any rights on individual \nbeneficiaries enforceable via Section 1983.  Whereas the \nnursing-home provisions in Talevski grouped rights-\nconferring provisions together in one place under a \nrights-focused heading, Section 1396a(a) lists 87 provi-\nsions of state-plan requirements without differentia-\ntion.  Whereas the nursing-home provisions set rights-\nrelated provisions apart, Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision falls partway through a \nlong list, most of which are not even arguably rights-\nconferring.   \nFurther, whereas the particular nursing-home pro-\nvisions in Talevski repeatedly referred to \u201crights\u201d and \nfocused on specific aspects of patient care, Section \n1396a(a)(23) never mentions \u201crights.\u201d  Although the pro-\nvision briefly mentions \u201cindividual[s],\u201d individual Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries are not its primary focus.  Rather, the \nprovision instructs States on what must be included in \n\n14 \n \ntheir Medicaid plans and directs the Secretary about \nwhat he must find in a state plan to approve it and con-\ntinue federal funding.  States also need to comply only \n\u201csubstantially,\u201d not perfectly, to maintain funding, show-\ning that Section 1396a(a)(23) is more concerned with \nstate decisionmaking in the aggregate.  As Talevski un-\nderscores, Congress knew how to employ Section 1983-\ntriggering language in another part of the Medicaid \nstatute\u2014but tellingly eschewed similar statutory words \nor structure here. \nThe line-drawing, litigation-inviting consequences of \ndeeming Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider \nprovision to create a privately enforceable individual \nright also militate against doing so.  Scattered through-\nout the list of 87 state-plan requirements are several \nother provisions whose phrasing resembles Section \n1396a(a)(23).  Other Spending Clause statutes use over-\nlapping language.  Finding the any-qualified-provider \nprovision to be privately enforceable would invite pri-\nvate enforcement of those other provisions.  Far from \ntreading carefully before recognizing Section 1983-\ntriggering rights, bringing Section 1396a(a)(23) within \nthe fold could trigger recognition of a dozen or more \nsimilarly worded provisions. \nFurther counseling against finding a privately en-\nforceable right in Section 1396a(a)(23), alternative en-\nforcement mechanisms are available.  The Secretary \ncan of course withhold funding from States, in whole or \nin part.  Federal regulations require a state administra-\ntive hearing process for providers excluded from Medi-\ncaid enrollment.  And the Medicaid statute requires \nStates to provide beneficiaries with an opportunity for \nan administrative hearing in certain circumstances. \n\n15 \n \nII. The court of appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion that \nSection 1396a(a)(23) is privately enforceable under Sec-\ntion 1983 reflects multiple legal errors.  Most signifi-\ncantly, the court parsed fragments of the any-qualified-\nprovider provision\u2014like the phrases \u201cany individual\u201d \nand \u201cmay obtain\u201d\u2014in isolation, but ignored the provi-\nsion as a whole and broader statutory context.  The \ncourt also misread this Court\u2019s decisions and 42 U.S.C. \n1320a-2 as foreclosing all consideration of the provi-\nsion\u2019s place in the statutory scheme.  The court of ap-\npeals thus mistook a commonplace formulation for the \nexceptional case.   \nARGUMENT \nI. THE ANY-QUALIFIED-PROVIDER PROVISION DOES \nNOT CREATE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ENFORCEABLE \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. 1983 \nPrivate individuals seeking to enforce Spending \nClause legislation through an action under 42 U.S.C. \n1983 face a demanding bar:  Congress must have unam-\nbiguously conferred individual federal rights in the stat-\nute.  Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002).  That \n\u201cstringent standard\u201d will be satisfied only in the \u201catyp-\nical case.\u201d  Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166, 183, 186 (2023).  This case is not \natypical.  The Medicaid statute\u2019s any-qualified-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is buried in a long, \nundifferentiated list of requirements for state Medicaid \nplans, and its text lacks \u201cexplicit rights-creating\u201d lan-\nguage.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284. \n\n16 \n \nA.  Spending Clause Statutes Must Unambiguously Confer \nIndividual Rights To Be Privately Enforceable Under \nSection 1983 \n1. Section 1983 creates a private cause of action \nagainst any person who, under color of state law, de-\nprives another \u201cof any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nSection 1983 thus authorizes suits against state actors \nwho violate \u201crights\u201d created by federal laws.  See Maine \nv. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980).  Not every violation of \na federal statute constitutes a deprivation of \u201crights\u201d \nunder Section 1983.  See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.  In-\nstead, private plaintiffs cannot enforce a federal statute \nunder Section 1983 unless the statute unmistakably \n\u201cconfer[s] individual rights upon a class of beneficiar-\nies.\u201d  Id. at 285.  Even then, Section 1983 enforcement \nmay be unavailable, if Congress signaled expressly or \nimplicitly that it displaced the Section 1983 remedy with \nothers.  See City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, \n544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005). \nLegislation enacted under the Spending Clause, U.S. \nConst. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 1, is particularly unlikely to confer \nenforceable individual rights.  The \u201ctypical remedy for \nstate noncompliance with\u201d conditions imposed in Spend-\ning Clause legislation \u201cis not a private cause of action \nfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Gov-\nernment to terminate funds to the State.\u201d  Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981).  \nUnless Congress \u201c\u200a\u2018speak[s] with a clear voice\u2019\u200a\u201d and \n\u201cmanifests an \u2018unambiguous\u2019 intent to confer individual \nrights,\u201d a Spending Clause statute is not privately en-\nforceable under Section 1983.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 \n(quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 28, & n.21) (empha-\nsis added). \n\n17 \n \n2. That rigorous standard harks to similarly strin-\ngent rules in related contexts.  Courts do not interpret \nstatutes to abrogate States\u2019 sovereign immunity unless \nCongress makes \u201cits intention unmistakably clear in the \nlanguage of the statute.\u201d  Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. \n223, 228 (1989) (citation omitted).  And only \u201cexplicit \n\u2018right- or duty-creating language\u2019\u200a\u201d suffices to show that \nCongress created a private right of action.  Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 284 n.3 (citing Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275, 288 (2001)).  Those rules are rarely satisfied. \nThe same is true here, not least because reading Spend-\ning Clause legislation to create rights privately enforce-\nable via Section 1983 can raise similar concerns.   \nStart with federalism considerations.  This Court has \nrequired Congress to speak clearly when its legislation \ndisrupts the usual federal-State balance of power.  See \nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  In Spend-\ning Clause programs like Medicaid, that balance is care-\nfully tailored:  the federal government establishes con-\nditions for funding, but within those parameters, States \ngenerally have latitude to develop their own programs.  \nSee Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  In-\ndeed, Spending Clause legislation operates \u201cmuch in \nthe nature of a contract.\u201d  Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17.  \nThe \u201clegitimacy\u201d of the federal-State bargain \u201crests on \nwhether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts \nthe terms of the \u2018contract.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.  A State cannot know-\ningly accept those terms if it \u201cis unaware of the condi-\ntions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\u201d  \nIbid.  Congress is thus expected to \u201cspeak with a clear \nvoice\u201d before imposing a condition on federal funding.  \nIbid.  The same degree of clarity is called for when the \nfunding condition involves a grant of individual rights \n\n18 \n \nthat could expose States to private enforcement suits \nunder Section 1983.   \nRequiring an unambiguous conferral of individual \nrights also alleviates potential \u201cseparation-of-powers \nconcerns.\u201d  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 286.  Congress, not the \njudicial branch, has \u201cprimacy\u201d over creating causes of \naction, and courts transgress that line by finding judi-\ncially enforceable rights where Congress leaves some \ndoubt that it intended to create them.  Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 183.  The rigorous standard of \u201cunambiguous confer-\nral\u201d also safeguards the Executive\u2019s role as the primary \nenforcer of state compliance with federal funding condi-\ntions.  See ibid.  If Congress intends the Executive to \nshare that enforcement with potentially millions of ben-\neficiaries, Congress can be expected to say so clearly. \n3. Earlier decisions of this Court appeared to \u201csug-\ngest that something less than an unambiguously con-\nferred right\u201d could still render Spending Clause provi-\nsions enforceable under Section 1983.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 282.  In Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. \n498 (1990), the Court reasoned that Spending Clause \nlegislation could be enforceable under Section 1983 as \nlong as the provision was \u201cintend[ed] to benefit the pu-\ntative plaintiff\u200a\u201d and the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s asserted interest in \nthe statute was not \u201ctoo vague and amorphous\u201d for \ncourts to enforce.  Id. at 509 (citations omitted).  The \nCourt\u2019s analysis in Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 \n(1997), also led some courts to permit private plaintiffs \nto enforce federal statutes under Section 1983 \u201cso long \nas the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest \nthat the statute is intended to protect.\u201d  Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 283. \nBut in Gonzaga, the Court \u201crepudiate[d] the ready \nimplication of a \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder\u201d and other \n\n19 \n \nearly cases exemplified.  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child \nCenter, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 330 n.* (2015).  Gonzaga held \nthat nothing \u201cshort of an unambiguously conferred \nright\u201d could \u201csupport a cause of action brought under  \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  536 U.S. at 283.  Only when the statutory \u201ctext \nand structure\u201d unambiguously contain \u201cexplicit rights-\ncreating\u201d language and an \u201cindividual\u201d focus can federal \nstatutes conceivably create Section 1983-enforceable \nrights.  Id. at 284, 286.  Policy-focused language\u2014like a \nprovision that \u201c[n]o funds shall be made available\u201d to \n\u201cany educational agency or institution which has a pol-\nicy or practice of permitting the release of [students\u2019] \neducation records\u201d without parents\u2019 written consent\u2014\nfails that bar.  Id. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). \nEven after Gonzaga was decided in 2002, courts of \nappeals continued to mix statutory analysis of a partic-\nular provision with a more freewheeling inquiry into \nquestions like whether Congress \u201cintended that the \nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood Arizona Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, 966 \n(9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341), cert. \ndenied, 571 U.S. 1198 (2014).  This Court in Talevski put \na stop to that approach, instructing that Gonzaga alone \n\u201csets the standard for determining when a Spending \nClause statute confers individual rights.\u201d  599 U.S. at \n193 (Barrett, J., concurring).  Talevski emphasized how \n\u201cstringent\u201d that standard is, and how infrequently it \nwill be met.  Id. at 186 (majority opinion).  Only in the \n\u201catypical case\u201d will Spending Clause legislation clear \nthe \u201csignificant hurdle\u201d of an unambiguous conferral of \nindividual rights.  Id. at 183-184.  Thus, \u201c\u00a7 1983 actions \nare the exception\u2014not the rule\u2014for violations of \nSpending Clause statutes.\u201d  Id. at 193-194 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring).   \n\n20 \n \nB.  The \nAny-Qualified-Provider \nProvision \nDoes \nNot  \nUnambiguously Confer Individual Federal Rights \n1. This Court\u2019s cases illustrate the hallmarks of un-\nusual, rights-conferring provisions versus features that \ndo not suffice.   \nOn one end of the spectrum, Talevski exemplifies the \n\u201catypical case\u201d where Congress clearly and unambigu-\nously created individual-focused rights enforceable un-\nder Section 1983.  599 U.S. at 183.  Again, Talevski in-\nvolved two provisions of a statute governing nursing \nhomes that Congress appended to the federal Medicaid \nstatute.  One required nursing homes to \u201cprotect and pro-\nmote\u201d residents\u2019 \u201cright to be free from\u201d certain \u201cphysi-\ncal or chemical restraints.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii).  \nThe second provided that nursing homes \u201cmust not \ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\u201d unless certain pre-\nconditions were satisfied.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A) and \n(B).  To parse those provisions, this Court began with \ntheir \u201cplace in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 184.  Both provisions were housed in a sub-\nsection of the statute titled \u201cRequirements relating to \nresidents\u2019 rights.\u201d  Id. at 184-185 (citations omitted).  Ze-\nroing in on the provisions\u2019 text, the Court observed that \nthey made multiple references to an individual benefi-\nciary (the \u201cresident\u201d), and several express references  \nto \u201crights.\u201d  Ibid.  The Court held that the combined ef-\nfect of the text and structure \u201cinexorably\u201d recognized \nindividual rights enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n192.  Even then, the Court considered whether other \nstatutory features rebutted that unambiguous rights-\ncreating language by suggesting that Congress had \nruled out Section 1983 remedies.  Id. at 186-191.   \nMany other types of provisions fall short.  Consider \nthe provision in Gonzaga:  \u201cNo funds shall be made \n\n21 \n \navailable under any applicable program to any educa-\ntional agency or institution which has a policy or prac-\ntice of permitting the release of [students\u2019] education \nrecords  * * *  without the written consent of their par-\nents.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1).  That nondisclosure provi-\nsion includes no \u201c\u200a\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language,\u201d \u201cspeak[s] \nonly to the Secretary of Education,\u201d and concerns only \nwhether entities have a generalized policy that would \ndisqualify them from funding.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n287-288 (citation omitted).  Further, institutions needed \nto comply only \u201csubstantially\u201d to avoid termination of \nfunding.  Id. at 288.  The absence of any mention of \n\u201crights,\u201d the provision\u2019s focus on the Secretary rather \nthan individuals, and its placement in a substantial-\ncompliance regime all foreclosed Section 1983 enforce-\nment. \nOr take the Medicaid provision in Armstrong, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A), which requires state plans to \n\u201cprovide such methods and procedures\u201d as necessary to \nassure that \u201ccare and services are available under the \nplan at least to the extent * * * available to the general \npopulation in the geographic area.\u201d  In a footnote, Arm-\nstrong explained that the medical-provider plaintiffs \nhad not tried to bring a suit under Section 1983, even \nthough Wilder had found a privately enforceable right \nfor a nearby Medicaid provision requiring state plans to \nprovide \u201cfor payment\u201d of certain services through \u201crea-\nsonable and adequate\u201d reimbursement rates.  575 U.S. \nat 330 n.*; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982).4  The Court \napproved of that strategic decision \u201csince our later opin-\nions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified.\u201d  575 U.S. at 330 n.*.   \n \n4  The provision in Wilder has since been repealed.  See Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 4711, 111 Stat. 507-508. \n\n22 \n \n2. Applying those precedents, the any-qualified-\nprovider provision of the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A) cannot surmount the \u201cdemanding bar\u201d \nfor unmistakably clear, rights-conferring language.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 180.  The statutory \u201ctext and struc-\nture\u201d do not reveal the requisite unambiguous conferral \nof individual rights.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 286.   \n \na. The Court in Talevski began by focusing on the \nFNHRA provisions\u2019 \u201cplace in the overall statutory \nscheme.\u201d  599 U.S. at 184 (citation omitted).  The Court \nobserved that the provisions were set off from the rest \nof the statute in a subsection expressly titled \u201cRequire-\nments relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d  Ibid.  (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c)).  That distinctive place in the statute \nwas, at the outset, \u201cindicative of an individual rights-\ncreating focus.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nBeginning in the same place here, the any-qualified-\nprovider provision lacks any special, distinctive place  \nin Section 1396a(a).  The any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion is housed in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, a section titled \u201cState \nplans for medical assistance.\u201d  Subsection (a) of that \nstatute, titled \u201cContents,\u201d includes 87 paragraphs of re-\nquirements for state Medicaid plans, of which the any-\nqualified-provider provision is number 23.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(1)-(87).  Those paragraphs are not ar-\nranged in any discernible order, let alone under sub-\nheadings that mention \u201crights.\u201d  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).   \nMany of the surrounding 86 paragraphs in 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a) lack even arguably rights-conferring language.  \nFor example, paragraph (a)(58) requires state plans to \nprovide for the development of a certain \u201cwritten de-\nscription of the law of the State.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(58).  And paragraph (a)(6) requires state plans \nto \u201cprovide that the State [Medicaid] agency will make \n\n23 \n \nsuch reports, in such form and containing such infor-\nmation, as the Secretary may from time to time re-\nquire.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(6).  That is simply a report-\ning requirement\u2014a generalized \u201c\u200a\u2018policy or practice\u2019\u200a\u201d of \nthe sort this Court held does not confer individual \nrights.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288-289.  Section 1396a(a) \nincludes many other similarly generalized policies.5  \nSome were added in the same amendments as the any-\nqualified-provider provision.  See, e.g., Social Security \nAmendments of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90-248, \u00a7\u00a7 227-229, 81 \nStat. 903-905.  Paragraph (a)(24), for example, requires \nstate plans to \u201cprovide for consultative services by \nhealth agencies\u201d to \u201chospitals, nursing homes,\u201d and \nother institutions.  \u00a7 228(a)(3), 81 Stat. 904 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(24)). \nIt is not apparent why Congress would have buried \na rights-conferring provision deep within a long list rid-\ndled with generalized policies.  If Congress intended to \nsingle out the any-qualified-provider provision as the \n\u201catypical case,\u201d one would expect the statutory struc-\nture to reflect that choice, as in Talevski. \nb. Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s place in the broader Medi-\ncaid statute reinforces its lack of special, Section 1983-\nenforceable features.  This Court has already observed \nthat provisions in a substantial-compliance regime for \nStates are less likely to trigger Section 1983.  Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 288.  A substantial-compliance regime tends \nto indicate a focus on the \u201caggregate practices\u201d of the \n \n5  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) (State plan must \u201cprovide that\u201d \nit \u201cshall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(59) (State must \u201cmaintain a list\u201d of \u201call physicians \nwho are certified to participate under the State plan\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(71) (State plan must \u201cprovide that the State will implement \nan asset verification program\u201d). \n\n24 \n \nfunding recipient, not \u201cwhether the needs of any partic-\nular person have been satisfied.\u201d  Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034, 1042 (8th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted); Gon-\nzaga, 536 U.S. at 288 (citation omitted).   \nThe Medicaid statute is a case in point:  a State need \nonly \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with Section 1396a(a) re-\nquirements to continue receiving federal funding.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396c(2).  Congress has even authorized the Sec-\nretary to waive entirely States\u2019 compliance with Section \n1396a(a) requirements under certain circumstances.  \nE.g., 42 U.S.C. 1315(a)(1) (authorizing waivers for States \nto conduct pilot projects).  As in Gonzaga, the fact that \nCongress tied federal funding to substantial compliance \nwith Section 1396a(a)(23) and its brethren\u2014and permit-\nted States not to comply at all if the Secretary grants  \na waiver\u2014undercuts the inference that Section \n1396a(a)(23) unambiguously secures individual rights.  \nc. In Talevski, the Court then evaluated the text  \nof the at-issue provisions alongside their place in the \nstatutory scheme.  See 599 U.S. at 185.  There, the re-\ncurrent references to \u201crights\u201d in various levels of  \nsubprovisions\u2014and to \u201cresidents\u201d in the specific provi-\nsions\u2014showed that Congress was unmistakably confer-\nring Section 1983-enforceable rights.  That same ap-\nproach yields the opposite inference here:  Section \n1396a(a)(23)\u2019s text, read in context, does not confer in-\ndividual rights with the requisite clarity. \nFirst, Section 1396a(a)(23) lacks \u201cexplicit rights-\ncreating\u201d language.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284.  Again, \nthe nursing-home provisions in Talevski were replete \nwith references to \u201crights\u201d:  nursing homes were  \nrequired to protect \u201cthe right to be free from\u201d certain \nrestraints, and the provisions were nestled within sub-\nheadings \nconcerning \n\u201crequirements \nrelating \nto \n\n25 \n \nresidents\u2019 rights\u201d and \u201ctransfer and discharge rights.\u201d  \n599 U.S. at 184-185 (brackets and citations omitted).  \nBut Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion never mentions \u201crights,\u201d let alone repeatedly.  \nWhile \u201crights\u201d is not a magic word, the dearth of even \nsynonyms for \u201crights\u201d in Section 1396a(a)(23) makes it \nharder to read the provision to unambiguously confer \nthem.  \nThe closest that Section 1396a(a)(23) comes is the \nphrase \u201cmay obtain\u201d:  state plans must provide that an \neligible individual \u201cmay obtain\u201d care from \u201cany institu-\ntion,\u201d \u201cqualified to perform the service\u201d required, \u201cwho \nundertakes to provide him such services.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A) (emphasis added); see Br. in Opp. 25.  In \nisolation, that phrase could be read as a freestanding \nguarantee that beneficiaries \u201cmay obtain\u201d medical care \nfrom their choice of qualified provider.  But other parts \nof the text undercut that reading. \nSection 1396a(a)(23) lacks an \u201cunmistakable focus on \nthe benefited class.\u201d  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186 (citation \nomitted).  In Talevski, the nursing-home provisions at \nissue, found in Section 1396r, were not directives to \nStates about what to include in plans or instructions to \nthe Secretary about preconditions State plans had to \nmeet to obtain approval.  Those provisions instead de-\nscribed \u201crights\u201d for individual nursing-home patients \nthroughout.  Here, however, while Section 1396a(a)(23) \nmentions \u201cindividual[s]\u201d who benefit from the federal-\nState bargain to furnish medical care, individual bene-\nficiaries are not the focus in the same way.  Read as a \nwhole, Section 1396a(a)(23) is directed to two other ac-\ntors:  the States and the Secretary.   \nAs to the States, all of Section 1396a(a) instructs \nStates what the required \u201cContents\u201d of their state plans \n\n26 \n \nmust be.  Language in Section 1396a(a)(23) shifts the \nfocus to States further, granting them the authority to \ndecline to provide payments to certain providers \u201ccon-\nvicted of a felony\u201d and to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d which felony \nconvictions should qualify.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23).   \nMeanwhile, Section 1396a is ultimately directed to \nthe Secretary of HHS, since the provision\u2019s reticulated \nprescriptions for plans tell the Secretary what to look \nfor before approving a State plan.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(b)) (\u201cThe Secretary shall approve any plan which \nfulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a).\u201d); see \nGillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  That feature of the statute \nled a plurality of this Court in Armstrong to conclude \nthat a nearby provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A), \u201cis \nphrased as a directive to the federal agency charged \nwith approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral \nof the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\u201d  575 U.S.  \nat 331 (plurality opinion).  In sum, the any-qualified-\nprovider provision \u201cserve[s] primarily to direct the Fed-\neral Government\u2019s distribution of public funds.\u201d  Talev-\nski, 599 U.S. at 183-184 (brackets and citation omitted). \nCongress could have taken another approach.  As \nTalevski illustrates, even within the Medicaid frame-\nwork, Congress knows how to create individual rights.  \nThe FNHRA is part of the Medicaid statute, and state \nplans must provide for compliance with its provisions  \nto be approved by the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(28)(A).  But Congress did not purport to confer \nindividual rights through that state-plan requirement. \nInstead, Congress created a separate, separately subti-\ntled provision focused expressly on rights, see Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 184, and cross-referenced that section in the \nstate-plan requirements for purposes of the Secretary\u2019s \nevaluation of plan compliance.  Had Congress wanted to \n\n27 \n \ncreate similarly enforceable individual rights to choose \nany qualified provider, Congress could have taken the \nsame tack.   \nC. Finding A Privately Enforceable Individual Right In \nThis Case Would Create Line-Drawing Problems \nIf Section 1396a(a)(23) creates privately enforceable \nrights, many analogous provisions sprinkled through-\nout the Medicaid statute and similar federal benefits \nprograms presumptively might as well.  Far from being \n\u201catypical\u201d exceptions, rights-creating provisions could \nswallow the \u201crule,\u201d contravening this Court\u2019s admoni-\ntions in Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183; id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring).  Other Spending Clause statutes likewise \ninclude state-plan requirements that refer to \u201cindividu-\nals\u201d and their benefits.  But respondents offer no prin-\ncipled way to draw lines between which of those provi-\nsions confer individual rights and which do not.  That \nrespondents\u2019 theory could potentially make many other \nSpending Clause provisions privately enforceable is an \nadditional reason to reject it, given Talevski\u2019s directive \nthat Section 1983 enforcement of Spending Clause leg-\nislation is meant to be atypical. \nScattered among the generalized state-plan policies \nin Section 1396a are several other provisions that, like \nSection 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision, \nrefer to \u201cindividual\u201d beneficiaries.  For example, para-\ngraph (a)(12) requires Medicaid plans to \u201cprovide that, \nin determining whether an individual is blind, there \nshall be an examination by a physician skilled in the dis-\neases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the in-\ndividual may select.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(12).  Like the \nany-qualified-provider provision, paragraph (a)(12) ref-\nerences an \u201cindividual\u201d and suggests that the plan must \nprovide that he \u201cmay select\u201d the eye specialist of his \n\n28 \n \nchoice.  If the words \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d suffice to \nunambiguously confer Section 1983-enforceable rights \nin paragraph (a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision, \nthen presumably they would unambiguously confer \nrights in paragraph (a)(12), too. \nOther provisions with similar phrasing crop up \namidst Section 1396a(a)\u2019s 87 paragraphs in no discerni-\nble order.  See pp. 22-23, supra.  Take paragraph (a)(3), \nwhich requires state plans to \u201cprovide for granting an \nopportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency \nto any individual whose claim for medical assistance un-\nder the plan is denied or not acted upon with reasonable \npromptness.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  Or paragraph \n(a)(26):  state plans must provide, \u201cwith respect to each \npatient receiving\u201d certain services, for \u201ca written plan \nof care.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(26).  Or consider paragraph \n(a)(53):  state plans are to provide \u201cfor notifying in a \ntimely manner all [eligible] individuals\u201d of \u201cthe availa-\nbility of benefits furnished by the special supplemental \nnutrition program.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(53).   \nOther examples include paragraph (a)(32), which re-\nquires States to provide that \u201cno payment\u201d for care \n\u201cprovided to an individual shall be made to anyone other \nthan such individual,\u201d or paragraph (a)(84), which re-\nquires state plans to provide that they will not termi-\nnate coverage \u201cfor an individual who is an eligible juve-\nnile\u201d because he is \u201can inmate of a public institution.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(32); 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84) (2018); \nsee Pet. Br. 37-40.   \nUnder respondents\u2019 theory, these provisions would \nalso trigger Section 1983.  And the line-drawing difficul-\nties these provisions present under that approach are \nalready apparent.  Lower courts have found some of \nthose provisions to be rights-conferring, but others not \n\n29 \n \nto be.  See, e.g., Shakhnes v. Berlin, 689 F.3d 244, 247 \n(2d Cir. 2012) (finding a privately enforceable right in \nparagraph (a)(3)), cert. denied, 569 U.S. 918 (2013); \nAliser v. SEIU California, 419 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1168 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019) (holding that paragraph (a)(32) \u201cdoes \nnot create an individually enforceable right\u201d).   \nTreating Section 1396a(a)(23) as a Section 1983- \nenforceable provision would open the door for similar \nprovisions\u2014and the attendant line-drawing problems\u2014\nin other Spending Clause statutes.  The Food and Nu-\ntrition Act of 2008, 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., includes a long \nlist of state-plan requirements mentioning individual \n\u201chouseholds,\u201d including that the State shall \u201cpromptly \ndetermine the eligibility of each applicant household\u201d \nfor supplemental nutrition assistance benefits.  7 U.S.C. \n2020(e)(3); see Briggs v. Bremby, 792 F.3d 239 (2d Cir. \n2015) (finding Section 1983-enforceable right).  The fed-\neral adoption-assistance statute requires state plans to, \namong other things, provide for a \u201cfair hearing\u201d to \u201cany \nindividual\u201d whose claim for benefits is denied or not \nacted upon with \u201creasonable promptness.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n671(a)(12); see ASW v. Oregon, 424 F.3d 970, 978 (9th \nCir. 2005) (finding Section 1983-enforceable right), cert. \ndenied, 549 U.S. 812 (2006).  And other benefits statutes \nrequire state plans to provide that assistance \u201cshall be \nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible in-\ndividuals.\u201d  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 302(a)(8), 1202(a)(11).  Those \nprovisions also mention individual beneficiaries and \nspecific benefits.  Respondents\u2019 theory offers no way to \ndistinguish between these provisions.  And those broad \nconsequences for analogous provisions suggest that \nSection 1396a(a)(23) cannot qualify as the \u201catypical \ncase\u201d of a privately enforceable Spending Clause provi-\nsion.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183.   \n\n30 \n \nD. Other Enforcement Mechanisms Protect Beneficiaries \nJust because Section 1396a(a)(23) is not privately en-\nforceable does not leave beneficiaries without protec-\ntion.  Alternative enforcement mechanisms protect in-\ndividual beneficiaries\u2019 interests, both with respect to \nthe any-qualified-provider provision and other similarly \nworded state-plan provisions.  If anything, those mech-\nanisms cut further against the notion that Congress un-\nmistakably designated Section 1396a(a)(23) as a trigger \nfor Section 1983 suits.  The existence of an alternative \n\u201cmechanism that Congress chose to provide for enforc-\ning\u201d certain provisions \u201cbuttresse[s]\u201d the \u201cconclusion \nthat [those] provisions fail to confer enforceable rights.\u201d  \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289. \nThe primary enforcement mechanism for Spending \nClause legislation is the termination of federal funding.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183; see 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2).  In ad-\ndition, the Secretary has rejected plan amendments \nthat fail to satisfy the any-qualified-provider provision \nand leave individual beneficiaries with insufficient \nchoice among qualified providers.  See, e.g., Letter from \nThomas A. Scully, Admin., Dep\u2019t of Health & Human \nServs., to Kathryn A. Plant, Dir., N.J. Div. of Med. As-\nsistance & Health Servs. (Sept. 19, 2002). \nThe Secretary has also required States to give pro-\nviders the right to an administrative appeal of their ex-\nclusion from Medicaid.  See 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  Re-\nspondents contend that it would have been futile for \nPlanned Parenthood to pursue such an appeal given \nthat South Carolina terminated its enrollment pursuant \nto state law.  Br. in Opp. 15 n.2.  But predicted outcomes \nin individual cases do not make the procedure an  \nineffective remedy across the board.  States terminate \nproviders\u2019 participation in Medicaid for different rea-\n\n31 \n \nsons, many of which are well suited to challenge in the \nadministrative appeals process.  The existence of that \nalternative mechanism for challenging the termination \nof a particular provider thus \u201cbuttresse[s]\u201d the conclu-\nsion that Congress did not intend to create a privately \nenforceable right for beneficiaries under Section 1983.  \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289.   \nGiven the availability of alternative remedies, find-\ning a Section 1983-enforceable right in this case \u201cwould \nresult in a curious system\u201d of duplicative enforcement.  \nGillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041; see Pet. Br. 42-43.  Provid-\ners would be able to challenge their disqualification  \nin state administrative proceedings while individuals \nwere challenging the same decision in federal court, po-\ntentially rendering conflicting decisions.  See ibid.  \nSubjecting States to competing litigation might also  \n\u201cdissuade state officials from making decisions that \nthey believe to be in the public interest\u201d when amending \nor implementing their Medicaid plans. Gee v. Planned \nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 586 U.S. 1057, 1058 \n(2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).   \nFor other state-plan provisions that mention \u201cindi-\nviduals,\u201d see pp. 27-29, supra, additional enforcement \nmechanisms may be available. For example, Section \n1396a(a)(3) requires state plans to provide for fair hear-\nings for individuals whose claims for medical assistance \nare denied.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  By federal regula-\ntion, state fair-hearing systems must \u201cmeet the due pro-\ncess standards set forth in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. \n254 (1970),\u201d 42 C.F.R. 431.205(d), and provide the op-\nportunity for a hearing when an individual claims that \nthe State has erroneously terminated, suspended, or re-\nduced his Medicaid benefits or eligibility, 42 C.F.R. \n431.201, 431.220.  And as those federal regulations \n\n32 \n \nreflect, the Due Process Clause independently requires \nnotice and a fair hearing before States can deprive indi-\nviduals of particular entitlements.  See Goldberg, 397 \nU.S. 254.  Rejecting respondents\u2019 broad theory of pri-\nvate enforcement here thus would not leave individual \nbeneficiaries without a remedy. \nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING AN IN-\nDIVIDUAL FEDERAL RIGHT \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision allowing respondents\u2019 \nSection 1983 action misapplied this Court\u2019s cases and \ncontravened this Court\u2019s recent admonitions about the \nrarity of rights-conferring provisions.  The court fo-\ncused on isolated language in the any-qualified-provider \nprovision\u2019s text but failed to properly consider how Sec-\ntion 1396a(a)(23) fits within Section 1396a(a) and the \nMedicaid statute writ large. \n \n1. Courts \u201cmust read the words Congress enacted \n\u2018in their context and with a view to their place in the \noverall statutory scheme.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 264, 275 (2023) (citation omit-\nted).  Thus, as noted, Talevski first examined the \nbroader statutory scheme governing nursing homes be-\nfore discussing how the at-issue provisions fit within \nthat scheme.  599 U.S. at 184-185. \nHere, however, the court of appeals below focused \nnarrowly on Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s references to \u201cany \nindividual\u201d and that eligible individuals \u201cmay obtain\u201d \nmedical assistance from qualified providers.  Pet. App. \n25a.  Even if that language, in isolation, could be read to \nconfer individual rights, additional statutory context \ndispels any inference that Congress unambiguously \nconferred privately enforceable individual rights.  The \nany-qualified-provider provision is simply one of a long \nlist of conditions that the Secretary must find to be \n\n33 \n \nsatisfied before approving state Medicaid plans, and \nthere are other ways of ensuring that Medicaid recipi-\nents have a choice of qualified providers.  See pp. 30-31, \nsupra.   \nBy ignoring the provision\u2019s place in the broader statute, \nthe court of appeals failed to follow Talevski\u2019s mode of \nanalysis and violated the basic rule that \u201cthe words of a \nstatute must be read in their context and with a view to \ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d  King v. \nBurwell, 576 U.S. 473, 492 (2015) (citation omitted). \n \n2. The court of appeals discounted broader evidence \nthat Section 1396a(a)(23) does not confer privately en-\nforceable rights based on an erroneous view of this \nCourt\u2019s precedents and a 1994 statute.  See Pet. App. \n27a-31a. \nThe court of appeals downplayed the any-qualified-\nprovider provision\u2019s place in the broader statute be-\ncause the Court in Wilder \u201calready held that a different \nfunding condition enumerated in \u00a7 1396a(a) confers in-\ndividual rights enforceable via 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d  See \nPet. App. 27a-28a.  As discussed, Wilder\u2019s reasoning has \nbeen repudiated.  See p. 21, supra.  Wilder supplies a \ncautionary tale, not interpretive instruction. \nThe court of appeals also invoked a separate statu-\ntory provision, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2, which provides, in rel-\nevant part: \nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of [the \nSocial Security Act], such provision is not to be \ndeemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a \nsection of this chapter requiring a State plan or spec-\nifying the required contents of a State plan.  This \nsection is not intended to limit or expand the grounds \nfor determining the availability of private actions to \nenforce State plan requirements other than by \n\n34 \n \noverturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. \nArtist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in \nprior Supreme Court decisions.  \nIbid.  The court of appeals seemed to read Section \n1320a-2 as a directive to consider whether a provision, \nin isolation, \u201cspeak[s] in clear and unambiguous terms,\u201d \nPet. App. 29a, and to place no weight on whether the pro-\nvision is a state-plan requirement.  That was error.  Sec-\ntion 1320a-2 prohibits courts from deeming provisions \nunenforceable under Section 1983 merely because of \ntheir inclusion in a state plan.  See Midwest Foster Care \n& Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, 1200 (8th \nCir. 2013).  It does not require courts to ignore entirely \nthe contextual significance of a provision\u2019s placement in \na list of state-plan requirements. \nFor similar reasons, the court of appeals was wrong \nto dismiss the argument that \u201cthe overlay of a substan-\ntial \ncompliance \nregime \nindicates\u201d \nthat \nSection \n1396a(a)(23) \u201chas an aggregate rather than individual \nfocus.\u201d  Pet. App. 30a.  The court noted that Wilder and \nTalevski both involved provisions within substantial-\ncompliance regimes.  Ibid.  But again, Wilder supplies \nno interpretive guidance.  And Talevski did consider \nbroad features of the Medicaid program, including that \nthe typical remedy for noncompliance with state-plan \nrequirements is to cut off federal funds.  599 U.S. at 181-\n182.  The Court simply found those features outweighed \nby the FNHRA\u2019s recurrent, explicit textual and struc-\ntural focus on individuals and their \u201crights.\u201d  See id. at \n183.  Talevski thus shows that courts should consider \nthe broader statutory context; what courts cannot do is \ntreat placement in a list of state-plan requirements as \nthe beginning and end of the analysis.   \n\n35 \n \n3. In an earlier decision, the court of appeals also \nmisread this Court\u2019s decision in O\u2019Bannon v. Town \nCourt Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  See Pet. \nApp. 62a-63a.6  The court of appeals stated that to the \nextent O\u2019Bannon is relevant, it \u201csupports the existence \nof a private right,\u201d because of a statement in the deci-\nsion that Section 1396a(a)(23) gives Medicaid recipients \n\u201c\u200a\u2018the right to choose among a range of qualified provid-\ners.\u2019\u200a\u201d Pet. App. 62a-63a (quoting O\u2019Bannon, 447 U.S. at \n787) (emphases added and omitted).   \nThe court of appeals read O\u2019Bannon\u2019s language out \nof context.  O\u2019Bannon was a due-process case, not a Sec-\ntion 1983 right-of-action case.  The Court held that \nPennsylvania did not violate the Due Process Clause by \nterminating a nursing home\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid plan without first holding a hearing, because \nSection 1396a(a)(23) does not create a cognizable prop-\nerty interest for Medicaid recipients \u201cto enter an un-\nqualified home and demand a hearing to certify it.\u201d  \nO\u2019Bannon, 447 U.S. at 785.  As an aside, O\u2019Bannon ob-\nserved that Section 1396a(a)(23) purportedly did create \n\u201cthe right to choose among a range of qualified provid-\ners.\u201d  Ibid.  But to the extent O\u2019Bannon was recognizing \nany \u201cright\u201d in that passage, it was a property interest \nsounding in due process, not an unambiguous conferral \nof a Section 1983-enforceable statutory right.   \nMoreover, read in context, O\u2019Bannon\u2019s discussion of \nrights actually cuts against finding a privately enforce-\nable right here.  For purposes of due process, O\u2019Bannon \nheld that Section 1396a(a)(23) \u201cclearly does not confer\u201d \n \n6 The court of appeals discussed O\u2019Bannon in its second decision, \nwhich this Court subsequently vacated in light of Talevski.  See Pet. \nApp. 62a-63a.  The court of appeals then declined to revisit its \u201cpre-\nvious determinations\u201d on remand.  Id. at 12a. \n\n36 \n \nthe very right that respondents assert here:  the right \nto challenge a State\u2019s termination of a particular pro-\nvider as unqualified.  447 U.S. at 785-786.  It would make \nlittle sense to interpret the same provision as \u201cunam-\nbiguously\u201d conferring an individual right to bring such \na challenge via Section 1983. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

It did, however, formalize my awareness of the current limitations of my predictive model.\n\nMy understanding of the petitioner's case, as detailed previously, is robust. It includes both a statutory argument that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) is directed at state plans, not individual beneficiaries, and a more radical constitutional argument, advanced by amici like the Southeastern Legal Foundation (SLF), urging an originalist re-evaluation of the Spending Clause itself. The SLF brief provides the Court with two distinct paths to rule for the petitioner: a narrow one based on a refined \"clear notice\" argument (linking *Pennhurst* to *NFIB v. Sebelius*) and a broad one that could fundamentally reshape federal-state relations by limiting Congress's spending power.\n\nThis observation confirms that my knowledge is currently one-sided. I have a detailed model of the arguments for reversal but lack any substantive information about the respondents' counter-arguments. My prior understanding of the respondents' position was based only on their brief in opposition to certiorari, which predates the more developed arguments from the petitioner and their amici. The current observation solidifies my assessment that my model is incomplete and that any prediction would be highly uncertain and potentially biased. My uncertainty is no longer just about the outcome, but is specifically rooted in the absence of the legal reasoning that the Fourth Circuit found persuasive and that the respondents will present to the Supreme Court. My core beliefs about the legal questions and the arguments presented by the petitioner have not changed, but my confidence in my ability to predict the outcome is low until I can observe the counter-arguments from the respondents or their supporting amici.",

          "task_beliefs": "This observation provides a highly significant signal that substantially updates my beliefs and shifts my predictive model. While my previous observation confirmed my knowledge was one-sided, this new evidence\u2014though not the respondent's brief I was seeking\u2014adds a powerful and influential voice to the petitioner's side.\n\nMy prior belief was that my model was incomplete, lacking the respondent's arguments. That remains true, but I have now observed that the United States, through the Solicitor General (SG), has filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioner, South Carolina. This is a major development, as the Court gives considerable weight to the SG's views, particularly in cases involving the interpretation of complex federal statutes like the Medicaid Act.\n\nCrucially, the SG's brief directly addresses and neutralizes a potential counter-argument by explicitly acknowledging a change in the government's position. The brief states that while the U.S. had previously argued that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) created an enforceable right, it has reversed its position \"after the change in Administration and in light of *Talevski*.\" This preemptively defangs any reliance the respondents might have placed on the government's prior stance and frames the issue as a direct application of the Court's most recent precedent.\n\nThe SG's brief provides a clear, narrow, and compelling path for the Court to rule for the petitioner without needing to engage with the more radical Spending Clause arguments presented by other amici. The core of the SG's argument, which I now integrate into my model, is a direct comparison to *Health & Hosp. Corp. v. Talevski*:\n\n1.  ***Talevski* as the New Standard:** The SG argues that *Talevski* clarified the \"significant hurdle\" a Spending Clause provision must clear to be privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983. The provisions in *Talevski* were found to be enforceable because they were explicitly collected in a subsection titled \"[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights\" and used unmistakable rights-conferring language.\n2.  **Structural Argument Against a Private Right:** The SG contends that the \"any-qualified-provider\" provision at issue here, \u00a7 1396a(a)(23), fails this test. It is not in a special \"rights\" section but is merely one of 87 undifferentiated provisions in \u00a7 1396a(a) under the generic heading \"Contents.\" It is \"sandwiched\" between administrative rules and lacks the explicit \"rights\" language that was dispositive in *Talevski*.\n3.  **Clear Notice Principle:** This structural argument reinforces the petitioner's core claim that the statute does not provide \"unambiguous notice\" to States, as required by *Pennhurst* and *Gonzaga*, that by accepting Medicaid funds they were also consenting to private lawsuits to enforce this specific provision.\n4.  **Alternative Enforcement:** The SG also highlights the statutory scheme's primary enforcement mechanism: the Secretary of HHS's authority to withhold federal funds from non-compliant states. This is presented as the \"typical remedy\" Congress intended, militating against the inference of a private one.\n\nMy predictive model is now significantly altered. The probability of a reversal of the Fourth Circuit's decision has substantially increased. The SG's brief provides a potential roadmap for a majority opinion authored by a justice who prefers to rule on narrow statutory grounds rather than broad constitutional ones. While my knowledge of the respondents' specific counter-arguments is still a major source of uncertainty, the ground has shifted. The question is no longer simply what the respondents will argue, but how they can possibly overcome the combined force of the petitioner and the Solicitor General, who are now armed with a powerful argument based on the Court's own recent precedent in *Talevski*.",

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation consists of my own internal reasoning and planning, not new external evidence about the case. As such, it does not introduce new facts, arguments, or signals that would alter my task-level beliefs (\u03b8). My beliefs remain stable, and this observation serves to confirm my current understanding and highlight the most significant remaining uncertainty.\n\nMy current belief state, which is preserved, is as follows:\n\nThe most significant development in this case is the amicus brief filed by the United States Solicitor General (SG) in support of the petitioner, South Carolina. This is a highly influential signal that substantially increases the probability of a reversal of the Fourth Circuit's decision.\n\nThe SG's brief provides a clear and narrow path for the Court to rule for the petitioner, based on a direct application of the Court's recent precedent in *Health & Hosp. Corp. v. Talevski*. The core arguments that now anchor my predictive model are:\n\n1.  ***Talevski* as the Controlling Standard:** The SG argues that *Talevski* established a \"significant hurdle\" for a Spending Clause provision to be privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983. The key is whether the statute uses unmistakable rights-conferring language and structure.\n2.  **Statutory Structure:** The \"any-qualified-provider\" provision (\u00a7 1396a(a)(23)) is argued to fail this test. Unlike the provisions in *Talevski*, it is not located in a section explicitly labeled with \"rights\" but is one of 87 undifferentiated administrative requirements under the generic heading \"Contents.\" This structural placement weakens the claim that it was intended to confer an individual right.\n3.  **Lack of Unambiguous Notice:** This structural argument directly supports the petitioner's core claim that the statute fails to provide the \"unambiguous notice\" required by *Pennhurst* and *Gonzaga* for a State to be considered to have consented to private lawsuits by accepting federal funds.\n4.  **Alternative Enforcement Mechanism:** The SG emphasizes that the Medicaid Act's primary enforcement tool is the Secretary of HHS's authority to withhold funds, suggesting Congress did not intend to create a parallel private right of action.\n5.  **Neutralized Counter-Argument:** The SG's brief proactively acknowledges and dismisses the federal government's previous position (which supported a private right of action), attributing the change to the new Administration and the intervening *Talevski* decision. This preemptively weakens a key argument the respondents might have made.\n\nMy beliefs remain stable, but my focus is now sharply defined. The central uncertainty in my model is no longer *if* there is a strong argument for the petitioner, but *how* the respondents can possibly overcome the combined force of the petitioner and the Solicitor General, who are armed with a powerful argument based on the Court's own recent precedent. The most valuable piece of information to resolve this uncertainty is the respondents' merits brief, which would reveal their strategy for distinguishing *Talevski* and defending the existence of a private right of action.",

It will resolve key uncertainties: (1) How, precisely, does the petitioner counter the respondent's text-focused reading of the statute? (2) How do they frame the recent, crucial precedent of *Talevski* in their full argument? (3) Which arguments do they emphasize, providing a signal of what they believe is most persuasive to the current Court? This will move my model from an inference-based prediction to one grounded in the primary source document for one of the two parties, dramatically sharpening my understanding of the central legal clash and improving predictive accuracy (Task EIG: 0.9). On a general level, analyzing the evolution of arguments from the cert stage to the merits stage provides a valuable data point on Supreme Court litigation strategy.

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J. New, More Abortions, More Taxpayer \nDollars, and Fewer Health Services, National Review \n(Apr. 17, 2024), perma.cc/E89W-6WL9. \nPPSAT\u2019s two South Carolina locations offer only \ntwo prenatal/postpartum services: pregnancy tests \n(necessary for an abortion) and \u201cmiscarriage care\u201d \n(including treatments for women who intentionally \nterminate their pregnancies with abortion drugs).1 \nPPSAT does not deliver healthy babies or help women \nbecome pregnant, but the Columbia site does offer \nsubsidies for abortions it provides.2 And less than \nthree years before its Medicaid disqualification, \nPPSAT\u2019s Columbia site was threatened with closure \nfor \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know \nAct, incomplete medical and employee records, \nimproper infectious waste disposal practices, [and] \nfailure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in \n[a] timely manner, among other violations.\u201d3 \n \n1 Prenatal and Postpartum Services in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/H7J8-KK6J; Prenatal and Postpartum \nServices \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/TQY4-XDDT. \n2 Pregnancy Testing and Planning in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/YVH6-ZAH5; Pregnancy Testing and \nPlanning \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/AC5U-H5A6 (noting that the site refers out prenatal \ncare and adoption services); Abortion in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/C4Z9-75A5. \n3 Matthew Stevens,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n126: 20250203121028207_23-127520Proof20of20Service20for20Petitioner20Brief.json (score: 0.405)\nNo. 23-1275,\nINTHE\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nEUNICE MEDINA, IN HER OFFICIAL CAPACTTY AS INTERIM DIRECTOR,\n\u2018SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\nPotitionor,\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ot a,\n\nRespondents.\n\u201cAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\nTHEREBY CERTIFY that all parties required to be served, have been served, on this\n3 day of February, 2025, in accordance with U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.3, three (3)\ncopies of the foregoing BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONER by placing said copies in\nFEDERAL EXPRESS, PRIORITY OVERNIGHT, postage prepaid, addressed as listed\nbelow.\n\nNicole Saharsky\n\n\u2018Mayer Brown LLP\n\n1999 K Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20006\n\n(202) 263-3052\nnsaharsky@mayerbrown.com\n\nWashington, DC 20086,\n(202) 347-8203\n\nDistrict of Columbia\nSigned and sworn to (or affirmed) before me on 3 day of February, 2025,\n\nPIERANGELI\n\u2018NOTARY PUBLIC, DISTRICT OF COLI\n\u2018My Commission Expires June 14, 2025,\n\n",

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J. New, More Abortions, More Taxpayer \nDollars, and Fewer Health Services, National Review \n(Apr. 17, 2024), perma.cc/E89W-6WL9. \nPPSAT\u2019s two South Carolina locations offer only \ntwo prenatal/postpartum services: pregnancy tests \n(necessary for an abortion) and \u201cmiscarriage care\u201d \n(including treatments for women who intentionally \nterminate their pregnancies with abortion drugs).1 \nPPSAT does not deliver healthy babies or help women \nbecome pregnant, but the Columbia site does offer \nsubsidies for abortions it provides.2 And less than \nthree years before its Medicaid disqualification, \nPPSAT\u2019s Columbia site was threatened with closure \nfor \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know \nAct, incomplete medical and employee records, \nimproper infectious waste disposal practices, [and] \nfailure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in \n[a] timely manner, among other violations.\u201d3 \n \n1 Prenatal and Postpartum Services in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/H7J8-KK6J; Prenatal and Postpartum \nServices \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/TQY4-XDDT. \n2 Pregnancy Testing and Planning in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/YVH6-ZAH5; Pregnancy Testing and \nPlanning \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/AC5U-H5A6 (noting that the site refers out prenatal \ncare and adoption services); Abortion in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/C4Z9-75A5. \n3 Matthew Stevens, SC DHEC files orders to shut down Planned \nParenthood, Fox 57 (Sept. 11, 2015), perma.cc/RJ49-US3U. \n\n9\nWhile PPSAT operates only two sites in the \nState\u2014in Charleston and Columbia\u2014South Carolina \nhas 140 federally qualified health clinics and preg-\nnancy centers, not counting the numerous private \nhealth providers who accept Medicaid:\nWomen Have Real Choices, Charlotte Lozier Inst., \nperma.cc/8QFG-RJ47.

Our Medical Services, Cooperative Health, \nperma.cc/AS69-G5FS. So a Medicaid beneficiary who \nvisits Waverly Women\u2019s Health for birth control will \nreceive care for her other medical issues, too.  \nConsider Respondent Julie Edwards\u2019s experience. \nShe has reported multiple serious health concerns, \nsuch as Type 1 diabetes (with complications), partial \nblindness, and nerve damage. Decl. of Julie Edwards \n\u00b6 2, J.A.29. But when she went to PPSAT, she was \noffered birth control and advised to seek care else-\nwhere for her elevated blood pressure. Resp. Br. for \nAppellees at 6, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. \nKerr, 27 F.4th 945 (4th Cir. 2022) (No. 21-1043). In \ncontrast, at Waverly Women\u2019s Health, she would have \nbeen offered birth control and in-network access to \nservices addressing her diabetes and other serious \nconditions. \nDisqualifying abortion providers like PPSAT \nensures that women receive comprehensive medical \ncare. It also ensures that South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nfunding goes toward improving \u201caccess to necessary \nmedical care and important women\u2019s health and \nfamily planning services\u201d for all women\u2014rather than \nimproving Planned Parenthood\u2019s ability to free up \nfunding to pay for abortions.

Three days \nlater, they moved for a preliminary injunction, argu-\ning that by disqualifying PPSAT as a Medicaid pro-\nvider, South Carolina violated Ms. Edwards\u2019s right to \nthe \u201cqualified provider of [her] choosing under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23).\u201d Pls.\u2019 Mot. for TRO and Prelim. \nInj. at 1, Planned Parenthood S.

District court grants preliminary injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nThe district court granted Ms. Edwards\u2019s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction and, because that ruling \nresolved the issue, did not analyze PPSAT\u2019s right to \nthe same relief. Pet.App.127a, 146a. On the \u201cissue of \nwhether \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) creates a private right of \naction enforceable through \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court applied \nthe so-called Blessing factors\u2014named for Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997)\u2014and said that it does. \nPet.App.132a\u201336a. \n\n13 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed. In analyzing wheth-\ner \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to create an individual right \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision is \u201cunambiguous,\u201d Pet.App.83a, \nthat court also applied the Blessing factors, assessed \nwhether Congress had \u201cforeclosed a \u00a7 1983 remedy,\u201d \nand then joined the circuits that had found \u201c a private \nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Pet.App.95a\u2013102a. \nThe court cited\u2014but did not discuss\u2014the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s contrary holding in Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017). Pet.App.96a, 103a. \nConcurring, Judge Richardson wrote separately \nto call for clarity: \u201cWhat is the proper framework for \ndetermining whether a given statute creates a right \nthat is privately enforceable \u2026?\u201d Pet.App.121a. And \nmore specifically, has Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), \u201cbeen repudiated (or \neven effectively overruled)?\u201d Ibid. \nB. District court grants permanent injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nWhile a petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court granted summary judgment to Respond-\nents and directed them to submit a draft order \ngranting a permanent injunction. Pet.App.69a, 78a\u2013\n79a. Five days later, they filed a brief in this Court \narguing that the Court should deny the State\u2019s \npetition because it was about to become moot. Suppl. \nBr. for Resp\u2019ts, Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-1186). And the Court \nsubsequently denied the petition. Baker, 141 S. Ct. \n550 (2020). \n \n\n14 \n \nMeanwhile, the district court entered an order \npermanently enjoining Petitioner from \u201cterminating \nor excluding\u201d PPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram based on its abortion activities. Pet.App.67a. \nAnd Petitioner appealed to the Fourth Circuit again. \nOn appeal, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that \nthe en banc Fifth Circuit in Kauffman had recently \nheld that the any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create private rights, Pet.App.51a\u201352a, but the \nFourth Circuit still refused to \u201creconsider [its] \nprevious panel decision,\u201d Pet.App.51a. \nConcurring only in the judgment, Judge Richard-\nson wrote separately to implore this Court to clear up \nthe \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d in the caselaw. \nPet.App.65a. \u201cGonzaga arguably laid down a different \ntest than Wilder and Blessing,\u201d he explained. Ibid. \nBut until this Court plainly repudiates them, lower \ncourts \u201cremain[ ] bound by Blessing and Wilder.\u201d Ibid. \nThe State filed a second petition for certiorari. \nC. After a GVR, the Fourth Circuit affirms \nagain. \nTwo months later, the Court granted certiorari in \nTalevski. Its opinion reaffirmed that \u201cGonzaga sets \nforth [the Court\u2019s] established method for ascer-\ntaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private rights in \nthe Spending Clause context. Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. But the Court said nothing about the ongoing \nvalidity of Wilder or Blessing. The Court then GVR\u2019d \nthis case. Pet.App.37a. \n \n\n15 \n \nOn remand, the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its \nprior decisions. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. Talevski, the court \nwrote, \u201coffered an illuminating analysis\u201d and \u201ca useful \nnew example of provisions enforceable via \u00a7 1983,\u201d \nbut the court did \u201cnot read it as toppling the existing \ndoctrinal regime.\u201d Pet.App.4a. Wilder remained good \nlaw, and the court (wrongly) thought that it \u201cwould \nappear to doom the State\u2019s argument at the starting \ngate.\u201d Pet.App.27a\u201328a. Finally, while Talevski had \n\u201cshed some new light on Blessing,\u201d it was not the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s \u201cprerogative to proclaim a Supreme \nCourt precedent overthrown.\u201d Pet.App.21a\u201322a.  \nAgain concurring only in the judgment, Judge \nRichardson noted that he had written separately \ntwice before \u201cto ask for clarity on the precedential \nstatus of Wilder \u2026 and, to a lesser extent, Blessing.\u201d \nPet.App.35a. He did so for a third time \u201cbecause even \nafter [Talevski],\u201d lower courts still \u201clack the guidance \ninferior judges need.\u201d Pet.App.35a\u201336a. They \u201clack \nsufficiently clear signals to be sure [this] Court has \ndiscarded Wilder\u2019s holding (or Blessing\u2019s test).\u201d \nPet.App.36a n.2. So the court was \u201cbound to stand by \n[its] previous holding.\u201d Pet.App.36a. \nThis Court granted certiorari. \n \n \n\n16 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThis Court has set a high bar for finding that a \nSpending Clause statute confers a federal right enfor-\nceable under Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision doesn\u2019t clear it. Congress \nmust speak with a \u201cclear voice\u201d and an \u201cunambiguous \nintent to confer individual rights\u201d for such a provision \nto confer a private right. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 \n(cleaned up). Congress must use unambiguously clear \nrights-creating language. Congress did not use such \nlanguage in the any-qualified-provider provision; the \nprovision says nothing about rights at all. \nTo date, this Court has identified only four provi-\nsions with clear rights-creating language: the two \nresidents\u2019-rights provisions in Talevski and the two \n\u201cNo person shall\u201d provisions in Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972. Congress used such language \nin Talevski by labeling the benefits conferred there as \n\u201crights.\u201d And the \u201cNo person shall\u201d language in Titles \nVI and IX\u2014two civil-rights statutes\u2014closely mirrors \nthe text of the Fifth Amendment. \nIn contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision, \nwhich says only that \u201cany individual \u2026 may obtain\u201d \nassistance from any \u201cqualified\u201d provider, does not \nspeak about \u201crights\u201d or use clear rights-creating \nlanguage lifted from the Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. \nAbsent such language, the \u201ctypical remedy for state \nnoncompliance with federally imposed conditions is \nnot a private cause of action \u2026 but rather action by \nthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState.\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981). \n\n17 \n \nThis Court has carefully cabined prior opinions \nthat some lower courts have read to establish \u201ca \nrelatively loose standard for finding rights enforce-\nable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282. But while \nthe Court has abandoned the so-called Blessing \nfactors and limited Wilder and Wright v. City of \nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 \nU.S. 418 (1987), to their facts, the Court has not yet \nexpressly overruled them or explicitly said that it has \nabandoned them. And that has left lower courts won-\ndering if they\u2019re bound to apply them. This case is a \nchance to provide much-needed clarity: the Court \nshould reiterate that it has abandoned Blessing\u2019s \nmulti-factored test and limited Wright and Wilder to \nspecific facts not implicated here. The Court should \nthen apply Gonzaga and Talevski and reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create a private right.  \nA. Only clear rights-creating terms create a \nprivate right in spending laws. \nThe \u201clegitimacy\u201d of Congress\u2019s exercise of its \nspending power depends on a state\u2019s voluntary and \nknowing acceptance of terms. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at \n17. \u201cRespecting this limitation is critical to ensuring \nthat Spending Clause legislation does not undermine \nthe status of the States as independent sovereigns in \nour federal system.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., \nplurality). So \u201cif Congress intends to impose a con-\ndition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. \n\n18 \n \nAbiding by that \u201cwell-established requirement\u201d \nensures states receive the \u201cclear notice\u201d they deserve. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 180 n.8. And \u201c[b]y insisting that \nCongress speak with a clear voice,\u201d the Court enables \nstates to \u201cexercise their choice knowingly, cognizant \nof the consequences of their participation.\u201d Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17. \nThat clear-statement rule applies when a private \nparty claims an enforceable right based on a provision \nin a Spending Clause statute like the Medicaid Act. \n\u201c[U]nless Congress speaks with a clear voice and \nmanifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual \nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for \nprivate enforcement by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n280 (cleaned up). That makes sense because Section \n1983 creates a cause of action for \u201cthe deprivation of \nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\u201d \nfederal law. 42 U.S.C. 1983 (emphasis added). \nAt least since Gonzaga, this Court has been clear \nthat it will not \u201cpermit anything short of an unambig-\nuously conferred right to support a cause of action \nbrought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d 536 U.S. at 283. As the Court \nreiterated in Talevski, that is a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d and \na \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d 599 U.S. at 180, 184; accord id. \nat 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar is high, and \nalthough the FNHRA clears it, many federal statutes \nwill not.\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \nabout the \u201chigh bar\u201d). \n \n \n \n\n19 \n \nSection \u201c1983 actions are the exception\u2014not the \nrule\u2014for violations of Spending Clause statutes.\u201d Id. \nat 193\u201394 (Barrett, J., concurring). So the question is \n\u201cwhether this is the atypical case\u201d in which a \nSpending Clause provision \u201cunambiguously confer[s] \nindividual rights, making those rights presumptively \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 183 (emphasis \nadded) (cleaned up). It is not. \n\u201cGonzaga sets forth [the Court\u2019s] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Under that test, it\u2019s not \nenough that a \u201cplaintiff falls within the general zone \nof interest that the statute is intended to protect.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. Rather, a court must exam-\nine the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d and determine \nwhether a plaintiff has made the \u201ccritical\u201d showing \u201cof \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language.\u201d Id. at 286, 287 (emphasis \nadded) (citing Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n288\u201389 (2001), and Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. \n677, 690 n.13 (1979)). \nAnd if a provision does have clear rights-creating \nlanguage, a plaintiff still must show that such lan-\nguage is \u201cphrased in terms of the persons benefitted,\u201d \nwith \u201can unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287 (cleaned up); accord \nUniversities Rsch. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754, \n772 n.23 (1981) (quoting U.S. for Benefit & on Behalf \nof Glynn v. Capeletti Bros., 621 F.2d 1309, 1314 (5th \nCir. 1980)). That means \u201cthe Gonzaga test is satisfied \nwhere the provision in question [1] is phrased in \nterms of the persons benefitted\u201d \u201cwith an unmistak-\nable focus on the benefited class\u201d \u201cand [2] contains \nrights-creating, individual-centric language.\u201d Talev-\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 (emphasis added) (cleaned up). \n\n20 \n \nIn sum, the \u201cquestion is not simply who would \nbenefit from the Act, but whether Congress intended \nto confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 294 (1981). \nAnd \u201crights-creating language\u201d is \u201ccritical\u201d to that \nshowing. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287 (cleaned up). \nB. The \nany-qualified-provider \nprovision \nlacks clear rights-creating language. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision has nothing \napproaching the \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d that \nwould make this the \u201catypical case.\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183, 186 (cleaned up). The provision requires \nonly that state plans provide that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any institution, agency, community \npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service \nor services required \u2026 who undertakes to provide \u2026 \nsuch services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). \nFirst and foremost, the text never mentions the \nword \u201cright\u201d or its functional equivalent. Compare \nwith Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (residents\u2019 \u201cright to \nbe free from\u201d restraints; \u201ctransfer and discharge \nrights\u201d) (cleaned up). Nor is it framed using the \nrights-creating \u201cNo person shall\u201d language Congress \nborrowed from the Bill of Rights when it enacted the \ncivil-rights statutes contained in Titles VI and IX. \nViewed contextually, the provision also does not \n\u201creside in\u201d a part of the Medicaid Act that \u201cexpressly \nconcerns\u201d requirements \u201crelating to [beneficiaries\u2019] \nrights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (cleaned up). \nInstead, it resides in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, titled \u201cState \nplans for medical assistance,\u201d under subsection (a), \nwhich is simply titled \u201cContents.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \n\n21 \n \nThe provision also limits the scope of the benefit \nto \u201cqualified\u201d providers while later acknowledging the \nstates\u2019 authority to decide what makes a provider \nqualified. See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1) (\u201cIn addition to \nany other authority, a State may exclude any indi-\nvidual or entity for purposes of participating under \nthe State plan under this subchapter for any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity \u2026.\u201d) (emphasis added). Letting the regulated \nentity\u2014here the state\u2014decide the scope of the right \nwould be an odd way to bestow a right. For example, \nit would have made no sense for the Framers to \nqualify the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech Clause by \nallowing the regulated entity\u2014Congress\u2014to define \nwhat qualifies as \u201cspeech.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. I. Or \nfor Congress to qualify Title IX by allowing the \nregulated entities\u2014schools\u2014to define what counts as \n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). Or for Congress \nin FNHRA to allow nursing homes to decide what \ncounts as \u201crestraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nTrue rights-creating language doesn\u2019t work that way. \nWhat\u2019s more, the provision speaks of \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d \na benefit from a third party. But that\u2019s quite unlike \nclear rights-creating language, which confers a right \ndirectly and in explicit terms. For example, FNHRA \ndid not say that any resident in a covered nursing \nhome \u201cmay obtain\u201d an environment free of physical or \nchemical restraints. Nor did it say that any resident \n\u201cmay obtain\u201d advance notice of a transfer or dis-\ncharge. Likewise, Congress did not write Title IX to \nsay any citizen \u201cmay obtain\u201d the benefits of a federally \nfunded education program free of sex discrimination. \nWhen Congress wants to create a private right, it \nconfers that right expressly and directly. \n\n22 \n \nTellingly, in enacting Section 1396a, Congress \nspecifically did invoke the words \u201cright\u201d and \u201crights\u201d \nin several places\u2014five times in the context of pay-\nments and a few more in the context of whistle-\nblowers, notifications about the right to accept or \nrefuse treatment, and the disregard of certain \nproperty in determining the eligibility of Indians. 42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(25)(H)\u2013(I), \n(a)(45), \n(a)(68)(C), \n(w)(1)(A), (ff)(3)\u2013(4). The only other mentions of \n\u201crights\u201d in Section 1396a are when Congress is discus-\nsing administrative appeals, both for individuals, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(ee)(4), and for providers, 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(kk)(8)(B). \nCongress chose not to mention rights when direct-\ning participating states to include the any-qualified-\nprovider provision in their plans. So at best, Respon-\ndents have to infer that Congress created a private \nright. And \u201can inference is not \u2018an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u201d Kauffman, 981 F.3d at 360 (quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283); accord 31 Foster Child. v. \nBush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1270 (11th Cir. 2003) \n(\u201cAmbiguity precludes enforceable rights.\u201d). \nOn its plain text, then, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision, like many statutes, may confer a benefit. \nAnd Ms. Edwards may even be within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. But that\u2019s not enough to unambigu-\nously confer a private right. The provision\u2019s text and \nstructure are devoid of any language resembling what \nthis Court has deemed clear rights-creating language. \nGonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 \n(citing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280), requires far more. \n\n23 \n \nC. The Court should retain its bright lines \nabout what qualifies as clear rights-\ncreating language. \nThus far, this Court has limited \u201cclear rights-\ncreating language\u201d to statutes where Congress \nexplicitly uses the label \u201cright\u201d or lifts language from \nthe rights-creating provisions of the Constitution. To \nkeep Gonzaga\u2019s bar \u201cdemanding,\u201d the Court should \nhold that line. The any-qualified-provider provision \nfalls far short, as this Court\u2019s precedents prove.  \n1. Talevski proves Congress can clearly \nconfer a private right by explicitly \nlabeling a benefit a \u201cright.\u201d  \nIn Talevski, this Court held that two provisions of \nFNHRA that explicitly reference \u201crights of nursing- \nhome residents to be free from unnecessary\u201d \nrestraints and to receive pre-discharge notice \u201cunam-\nbiguously create \u00a7 1983-enforceable rights.\u201d 599 U.S. \nat 171\u201372 (emphasis added). The provisions satisfied \n\u201cGonzaga\u2019s stringent standard\u201d given their \u201cclear \nrights-creating language.\u201d Id. at 186 (cleaned up). \n\u201cTo start, \u2026 both [the unnecessary-restraint and \npredischarge-notice provision] reside in 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1396r(c), which expressly concerns \u2018[r]equirements \nrelating to residents\u2019 rights.\u2019\u201d Id. at 184 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c)). As this Court explained it, \u201c[t]his \nframing is indicative of an individual \u2018rights-creating\u2019 \nfocus.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \n\u201cExamined further,\u201d the provisions\u2019 text \u201cunambig-\nuously confers rights upon the residents of nursing-\nhome facilities.\u201d Ibid. \n\n24 \n \nThe unnecessary-restraint provision appears in a \nstatutory subsection called \u201cGeneral rights\u201d and in a \nsubsubsection titled \u201cSpecified rights.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). That provision \nrequires nursing homes to \u201cprotect and promote\u201d the \nrights of each resident, including \u201c[t]he right to be free \nfrom \u2026 any physical or chemical restraints \u2026 not \nrequired to treat the resident\u2019s medical symptoms.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii)). The provision sits alongside addi-\ntional provisions that protect \u201c[t]he right to choose a \npersonal attending physician\u201d (more on this in a \nmoment), \u201c[t]he right to privacy,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to \nconfidentiality,\u201d the \u201cright \u2026 to reside and receive \nservices with reasonable accommodation of individual \nneeds,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \u2026 to receive notice before the \nroom or roommate of the resident in the facility is \nchanged,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to voice grievances,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \nof the resident to organize and participate in resident \ngroups,\u201d \u201cthe right of the resident\u2019s family to meet in \nthe facility,\u201d \u201c[t]he right of the resident to participate \nin social, religious, and community activities,\u201d \u201c[t]he \nright to examine\u201d facility survey results, \u201c[t]he right \nto refuse a transfer to another room,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny other \nright established by the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(i), (iii)-(xi) (emphasis added). FNHRA \nrefers to these as \u201clegal rights.\u201d Id. at (c)(1)(B)(i), (iv). \nThe \u201cpredischarge-notice provision is more of the \nsame.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. \u201cNestled in a para-\ngraph concerning \u2018transfer and discharge rights,\u2019 that \nprovision tells nursing facilities that they \u2018must not \ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\u2019 unless certain \npreconditions are met, including advance notice \u2026 to \nthe resident and his or her family.\u201d Id. at 184\u201385 \n\n25 \n \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)) (cleaned up); accord id. \nat 192 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he text of the \nAct\u2019s operative provisions refers to individual \n\u2018rights.\u2019\u201d). And before effecting a transfer or discharge, \nFNHRA requires the nursing home to provide a notice \nthat must include \u201cnotice of the resident\u2019s right to \nappeal the transfer or discharge.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(2)(B)(i), (iii). \nAs a result, \u201cthe text of the unnecessary-restraint \nand predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously \nconfer[ ] rights upon the residents.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 184. Those provisions \u201cstand in stark contrast to \nthe statutory provisions that failed Gonzaga\u2019s test in \nGonzaga itself.\u201d Id. at 185.  \nConversely, the any-qualified-provider provision \nnever mentions the word \u201cright\u201d or its equivalent. To \nbe sure, the phrase \u201cmay obtain \u2026 assistance\u201d might \nconfer a benefit. But that is not enough under Talev-\nski and Gonzaga. \u201c[I]t is rights, not the broader or \nvaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018interests,\u2019 that may be enforced\u201d \nunder Section 1983. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. \nDriving that point home, FNHRA proves that \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage in a Spending Clause provision when it wants \nto confer the right to choose a healthcare provider. As \nnoted above, in the same subsection that this Court \nanalyzed in Talevski\u2014\u201cRequirements relating to \nresidents\u2019 rights\u201d\u2014Congress required that a \u201cnursing \nfacility must protect and promote the rights of each \nresident, including\u201d the \u201cright[ ]\u201d of \u201cFree choice,\u201d \nstarting with the \u201cright to choose a personal attending \nphysician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis \nadded). \n\n26 \n \nThe text and structure of the any-qualified-\nprovider provision contain no such rights-creating \nlanguage. And Congress\u2019s \u201cuse of explicit language in \nother statutes cautions against inferring\u201d Congress \nintended to say something it didn\u2019t say in the statute \nunder consideration. Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 \nU.S. 371, 384 (2013). If that\u2019s true where \u201cexplicit \nlanguage\u201d is not required, ibid., then in a context like \nthis one, where explicit rights-creating language is \nrequired, the absence of that language\u2014coupled with \nits presence in statutes like FNHRA\u2014is dispositive. \nSee Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 (\u201cWe therefore begin \n(and find that we can end) our search for Congress\u2019s \nintent with the text and structure of Title VI.\u201d). \n2. Titles VI and IX prove Congress can \nclearly confer a private right by \nusing text from the rights-creating \nprovisions of the U.S. Constitution. \nThe two rights-creating provisions this Court \nidentified in Gonzaga\u2014Title VI and Title IX\u2014confirm \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage. As Gonzaga recognized, both contain \u201cexplicit\u201d \nrights-creating terms. 536 U.S. at 284 n.3. \u201cTitle VI \nprovides: \u2018No person in the United States shall ... be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance\u2019 on the \nbasis of race, color, or national origin.\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 2000d) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). And \n\u201cTitle IX provides: \u2018No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, ... be subjected to dis-\ncrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1681(a)) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). \n\n27 \n \nThis Court\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cNo \nperson shall,\u201d located in two civil-rights statutes, \nqualifies as clear rights-creating language follows \nnaturally from the phrase\u2019s deeply rooted, rights-\ncreating pedigree. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Bill of \nRights and analogous provisions in nearly all the \nstates\u2019 constitutions have included that phrase for \ncenturies. See U.S. Const. amend. V (\u201cNo person shall \n\u2026\u201d); John T. McNaughton, The Privilege against Self-\nIncrimination, 51 J. Crim. L. Criminology & Police \nSci. 138, 139 (1960) (noting that \u201cthe constitutions of \nall but two states\u201d contain verbatim \u201cNo person shall\u201d \nlanguage or its equivalent).  \nBy contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision \ncontains no such clear rights-creating language. \nAlthough the court below thought the phrase \u201cany \nindividual\u201d \u201cclosely mirrors\u201d the \u201cNo person \u2026 shall\u201d \nphrasing highlighted in Gonzaga, Pet.App.57a, that \nconclusion is fatally flawed.  \nCongress could have drawn on the rights-creating \npedigree of the phrase \u201cNo person shall\u201d and required \nstate plans to provide that \u201cno person shall be denied \nthe free choice of any provider qualified to perform the \nrequired services.\u201d But Congress did not write that. \nInstead, it used \u201cmay\u201d in place of the more traditional \nrights-creating \u201cshall,\u201d it limited the scope of the class \nto \u201celigible\u201d individuals, it gave states authority to \ndecide what makes a provider \u201cqualified,\u201d and it spoke \nof \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d a benefit from a third party. \nDespite all this, Respondents have argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision should be read as \nthough it were written like Titles VI and IX, but this \nCourt usually does not \u201cread into statutes words that \n\n28 \n \naren\u2019t there.\u201d Romag Fasteners, Inc v. Fossil, Inc., 590 \nU.S. 212, 215 (2020). Accord Morse v. Republican \nParty of Va., 517 U.S. 186, 286\u201388 (1996) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Scalia, J., and \nin relevant part, Kennedy, J.) (concluding, pre-\nGonzaga, that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \ncontained a private right of action but Section 10 did \nnot because only the former used the familiar \u201cno \nperson shall\u201d term of art). \nNor can Respondents transform the any-\nqualified-provider provision into a \u201cfree-choice-of-\nprovider provision\u201d simply by attaching that label to \nit. Contra Opp.i (adopting this label and inserting it \ninto the first question presented). The provision\u2019s text \ndoes not contain the phrase \u201cfree choice,\u201d much less \nthe clear rights-creating language in Titles VI and IX. \nStretching the text, Respondents try to \u201cconjure up a \nprivate [right] that has not been authorized by \nCongress.\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291. But the \nabsence of \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d calls the \nCourt to reject that effort. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186. \n3. Absent such explicit rights-creating \nlanguage, spending statutes do not \ncreate private rights, as this Court\u2019s \nprecedents prove.  \nIn Gonzaga, a student sued his private university \nunder Section 1983 to enforce provisions in FERPA \n\u201cprohibit[ing] the federal funding of educational insti-\ntutions that [had] a policy or practice of releasing \neducation records to unauthorized persons.\u201d Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 276. One provision stated: \n\n29 \n \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein \u2026) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). \nA second added that \u201c[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u201d to educational entities with \u201ca policy or \npractice of releasing, or providing access to, [certain] \npersonally identifiable information \u2026 unless\u2014there is \nwritten consent from the student\u2019s parents \u2026 with a \ncopy of the records to be released to the student\u2019s \nparents and the student if desired by the parents\u201d or a \ncourt order approving the release.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(b)(2) (emphasis added). \nThe \nGonzaga \ndissent \nthought \nthe \nsecond \nprovision \u201cplainly [met] the standards\u201d this Court \n\u201carticulated in Blessing for establishing a federal \nright.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 295 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning). It was \u201cdirected to the benefit of individual \nstudents and parents,\u201d it was \u201cbinding on States,\u201d it \nwas \u201ccouched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms,\u201d it was \u201cfar from vague and amorphous,\u201d and \nit spoke \u201cof the individual \u2018student,\u2019 not students \ngenerally.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The dissent also high-\nlighted the \u201crights-creating language in the title\u201d of \nFERPA\u2014the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct\u2014the \u201ctext of the Act,\u201d and its \u201coverall context.\u201d Id. \nat 293, 296. \n\n30 \n \nDespite all that, this Court held it was not \nenough. The provisions \u201clack[ed] the sort of \u2018rights-\ncreating\u2019 language critical to showing the requisite \ncongressional intent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. \nInstead, the Act spoke \u201conly to the Secretary of \nEducation, directing that \u2018[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u2019 to any \u2018educational agency or institution\u2019\u201d \nwith \u201ca prohibited \u2018policy or practice.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). And that made the Act\u2019s \u201cfocus \n\u2026 two steps removed from the interests of individual \nstudents and parents.\u201d Ibid. \nRespondents\u2019 arguments here sound like the Gon-\nzaga dissent. Though the any-qualified-provider \nprovision is a directive and uses the word \u201cindivid-\nual,\u201d the text lacks \u201c\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language,\u201d and \nspeaks only to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. \nCompare \nibid. \nThat \nmakes \nSection \n1395a(a)(23) two steps removed from the interests of \nbeneficiaries. Ibid. \n\u201cThe Court consistently has found that Congress \nintended to create a cause of action \u2018where the \nlanguage of the statute explicitly confers a right \ndirectly on a class of persons that includes the \nplaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & \nSmith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 391 n.91 (1982) \n(emphasis added) (cleaned up) (quoting Cannon, 441 \nU.S. at 690 n.13). Conversely, it has noted that there \n\u201cwould be far less reason to infer a private remedy in \nfavor of individual persons\u201d where Congress, rather \nthan drafting the legislation \u201cwith an unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class,\u201d has framed the statute \nsimply as a general prohibition or a command to a \nfederal agency. Coutu, 450 U.S. at 771\u201373 (citing \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392 & n.13). \n\n31 \n \nSimilarly, in Coutu, the Court addressed the \nprivate enforceability of minimum-wage provisions in \nthe Davis-Bacon Act that are analogous to the any-\nqualified-provider provision. 450 U.S. at 756\u201357. The \nlead provisions there required that advertised specifi-\ncations for certain federal construction contracts \n\u201cshall contain a provision stating the minimum wages \nto be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics \nwhich shall be based\u201d on the prevailing rates for lab-\norers and mechanics working on similar projects. Id. \nat 756\u201357 (quoting what are now located at 40 U.S.C. \n3142(a) and (b)) (emphasis added). A separate pro-\nvision added that \u201c[e]very contract based upon these \nspecifications must contain a stipulation that the \ncontractor shall pay wages not less than those stated \nin the specifications.\u201d Id. at 757 (emphasis added) \n(describing what is now located at 40 U.S.C. 3142(c)). \nThis Court had previously \u201crecognized that on its \nface, the Act is a minimum wage law designed for the \nbenefit of construction workers.\u201d Id. at 771 (cleaned \nup). But that \u201cdesign[ ]\u201d did \u201cnot end the inquiry.\u201d \nIbid. Instead, the Court asked \u201cwhether the language \nof the statute indicates that Congress intended that it \nbe enforced through private litigation.\u201d Ibid. That \nintent exists only \u201c\u2018where the language of the statute \nexplicitly confer[s] a right directly on a class of persons \nthat include[s] the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at 772 (emphasis \nadded) (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \n\u201cConversely,\u201d no private cause of action arises \nwhen Congress \u201cframe[s] the statute simply as a gen-\neral prohibition or a command to a federal agency.\u201d \nIbid. (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392). And \nthat\u2019s what Congress did in \u201cSection 1 of the Davis-\nBacon Act,\u201d which required \u201ccertain stipulations be \n\n32 \n \nplaced in federal construction contracts for the benefit \nof mechanics and laborers, but [did] not confer rights \ndirectly on those individuals.\u201d Ibid. Given that \nomission, the Act\u2019s language \u201cprovide[d] no support \nfor the implication of a private remedy.\u201d Id. at 773. \nSo too here. Congress directed the Secretary to \n\u201capprove any plan which fulfills the conditions\u201d in \n1396a(a), including that a \u201cState plan for medical \nassistance must \u2026 provide that \u2026 any individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any \u2026 qualified\u201d provider. 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(b), (a)(23). That condition may have been \n\u201cdesigned to benefit a particular class,\u201d like the Davis-\nBacon Act was designed to benefit mechanics and \nlaborers, but that \u201cdoes not end the inquiry.\u201d Coutu, \n450 U.S. at 771. It also may have been stated as a \nmandatory component, like the Davis-Bacon Act was. \nId. at 757 (describing stipulations that contracts \n\u201cmust contain\u201d). But as Coutu proves, that is not \nenough to create a privately enforceable right where, \nas here, a statute is framed \u201csimply as \u2026 a command \nto a federal agency\u201d and does not \u201c\u2018explicitly confer[ ] \na right directly on a class of persons that include[s] \nthe plaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Id. at 772 (quoting Cannon, \n441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \nUltimately, the question is \u201cone of congressional \nintent, not one of whether this Court thinks it can \nimprove upon the statutory scheme that Congress \nenacted into law.\u201d Id. at 770 (cleaned up). As for the \nany-qualified-provider provision\u2019s text, Congress\u2019s \nintent is clear: The \u201crights-creating language so \ncritical to the Court\u2019s analysis\u201d in its cases \u201cis \ncompletely absent\u201d here. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 \n(cleaned up). And that ends the analysis. Ibid. \n\n33 \n \nD. The Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory \nregime reinforces that the any-qualified-\nprovider provision does not create \nprivate rights. \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory scheme \nconfirms what the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext has already shown\u2014that the provision does not \ncreate privately enforceable rights. \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute that \nimposes duties and restraints on states. It is merely a \nfunding mechanism, and state \u201cparticipation in the \nMedicaid program is entirely optional.\u201d Harris v. \nMcRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980). States that choose \nto participate in Medicaid may also choose to change \ntheir programs, even if doing so creates the possibility \nthat the Secretary will deny funding. 42 U.S.C. 1396c; \n42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \nThe Act\u2019s baseline requirement for states is \nproviding coverage to \u201ccategorically needy\u201d groups for \nsome basic services. Barbara S. Klees et al., Ctrs. for \nMedicare & Medicaid Servs., Brief Summaries of \nMedicare & Medicaid: Title XVIII & Title XIX of The \nSocial Securities Act 22\u201326 (Dec. 31, 2012). Beyond \nthat, states can choose how they want to structure \ntheir programs when it comes to eligibility standards, \nscope of coverage, payment methodology, and the like. \nId. at 22\u201328. The Secretary alone decides if a state \nhas satisfied the Act\u2019s requirements and, if the state \nlater falls out of compliance in administering its plan, \nwhether to withhold some or all of the state\u2019s funding. \n42 U.S.C. 1396c; 42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \n \n\n34 \n \nPut differently, the Act imposes a legally binding \ndirective only on the Secretary, who is charged with \napproving plans and ensuring states substantially \ncomply with the Act\u2019s plan requirements to continue \nreceiving funds. 42 U.S.C. 1396c. Absent a Talevski-\nlike bill of rights, \u201c[f]ocusing on substantial compli-\nance is tantamount to focusing on the aggregate \npractices of a state funding recipient.\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare & Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, \n1201 (8th Cir. 2013). \nLike the FERPA provisions in Gonzaga, then, \nSection 1396a and the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion are \u201cprimarily directed [at] the Federal Govern-\nment\u2019s \u2018distribution of public funds,\u2019 [with] \u2018an \naggregate, not individual, focus.\u2019\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 185\u201386 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290). The \nSecretary must look at the aggregate of more than 80 \ndisparate plan requirements and assess a state\u2019s sub-\nstantial compliance. \u201cEven where a subsidiary provi-\nsion includes mandatory language that ultimately \nbenefits individuals, a statute phrased as a directive \nto a federal agency typically does not confer enforce-\nable federal rights on the individuals.\u201d Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d at 1041 (citing Coutu, 450 U.S. at 756 n.1). \nJust as the Medicaid Act charges the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services with dealing with state \nviolations, Congress in FERPA explicitly authorized \nthe Secretary of Education to \u201cdeal with violations\u201d of \nthat Act. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(f)). And there was \u201cno question that FERPA\u2019s \nnondisclosure provisions fail[ed] to confer enforceable \nrights.\u201d Id. at 287. There is likewise no question that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision fails to confer an \nenforceable right here. \n\n35 \n \nThe plurality\u2019s analysis in Armstrong bolsters \nthat conclusion. 575 U.S. at 331\u201332 (Scalia, J., joined \nby Roberts, C.J., Thomas, J., and Alito, J.). Its opinion \nanalyzed 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)\u2014a subsection of the \nMedicaid Act parallel to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision\u2014and noted that it is \u201cphrased as a directive \nto the federal agency charged with approving state \nMedicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue \nupon the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s decision to partic-\nipate in Medicaid.\u201d Id. at 331. \u201c[S]uch language re-\nveals no congressional intent to create a private right \nof action.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The same is true here. \nIn this case, the Fourth Circuit placed great \nweight on 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 in dismissing any \nrelevance of the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \nappearance in a statute \u201crequiring a State plan or \nspecifying the required contents of a State plan.\u201d \nPet.App.29a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2). But as the \nEighth Circuit has explained, Section 1320a-2 simply \nmeans that a provision \u201ccannot be deemed indivi-\ndually unenforceable solely because of its situs in a \nlarger regime \u2018requiring a State plan or specifying the \nrequired contents of a state plan.\u2019\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare, 712 F.3d at 1200 (emphasis added). And \u201cwhen \na statute links funding to substantial compliance with \nits conditions\u2014including forming and adhering to a \nstate plan with specified features\u2014this [link] \ncounsels against the creation of individually enforce-\nable rights.\u201d Ibid. That\u2019s \u201cbecause, even where a state \nsubstantially complies with its federal responsibili-\nties, a sizeable minority of its beneficiaries may none-\ntheless fail to receive the full panoply of offered \nbenefits.\u201d Id. at 1200\u201301. True rights-creating provi-\nsions require more than this. \n\n36 \n \nTellingly, the Armstrong plurality did not think \nSection 1320a-2 foreclosed its consideration of this \ncritical statutory context. See Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n376 (Elrod, J., concurring, joined by six other judges) \n(explaining that Section 1320a-2 \u201cdid not inform the \nanalysis\u201d in Armstrong). Neither should this Court.  \nStanding alone, the Medicaid Act\u2019s substantial \ncompliance regime, its directive to the Secretary, or \nits articulation of dozens of plan requirements might \nnot be enough to foreclose private enforceability. See \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 328 (making that point \nregarding the Secretary\u2019s ability to withhold funds). \nBut taken together, they confirm what the text \nestablishes\u2014that Congress chose not to confer a \nprivately enforceable right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \nE. Common sense confirms what text and \nstructure prove. \n1. Respondents\u2019 approach would drop \nTalevski\u2019s high bar to the floor.  \nIn their opposition brief, Respondents argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision \u201chas an \u2018unmis-\ntakable focus\u2019 on the benefited class and is \u2018phrased in \nterms of the persons benefited,\u2019\u201d which, Respondents \nclaimed, \u201c\u2018satisfie[s]\u2019 this Court\u2019s test for whether a \nstatute contains the necessary rights-creating lan-\nguage.\u201d Opp.16 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). \nSuch a reading of Talevski would drop Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cde-\nmanding bar\u201d to the floor. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180. \n \n\n37 \n \nA statute that \u201caddresses,\u201d Opp.16, a benefited \nclass still must contain clear rights-creating language \nto confer privately enforceable rights. Per Gonzaga, \n\u201crights-creating\u201d language is \u201ccritical to showing the \nrequisite congressional intent to create new rights.\u201d \n536 U.S. at 287 (emphasis added); accord Sandoval, \n532 U.S. at 288 (same). Focus on a benefited class is \nnecessary\u2014but not sufficient. \nConsider the implications of finding privately \nenforceable rights simply because a statute \u201cadd-\nresses whether \u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients \u2018may \nobtain\u2019\u201d a benefit. Opp.16. Leaving aside that Section \n1396a(a) uses the word \u201cindividual\u201d hundreds of \ntimes, eight of the 87 listed plan-requirement provi-\nsions contain individual-focused, benefit-conferring \nlanguage that likely would satisfy Respondents\u2019 lax \ntest. Those provisions say that a \u201cState plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d do the following: \n(3)  \u201cprovide for granting an opportunity for a fair \nhearing before the State agency to any \nindividual \nwhose \nclaim \nfor \nmedical \nassistance under the plan is denied or is not \nacted upon with reasonable promptness,\u201d \n1396a(a)(3) (emphasis added); \n(8)  \u201cprovide that all individuals wishing to make \napplication for medical assistance under the \nplan shall have opportunity to do so, and that \nsuch assistance shall be furnished with \nreasonable \npromptness \nto \nall \neligible \nindividuals,\u201d 1396a(a)(8) (emphasis added); \n \n\n38 \n \n(10) \u201cprovide\u2014(B) that the medical assistance \nmade available to any individual described \nin subparagraph (A)\u2014(i) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to any other such \nindividual, and (ii) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to individuals not \ndescribed \nin \nsubparagraph \n(A),\u201d \n1396a(a)(10)(B) (emphasis added); \n       \u201cprovide\u2014(D) for the inclusion of home health \nservices for any individual who, under the \nState plan, is entitled to nursing facility \nservices,\u201d 1396a(a)(10)(D) (emphasis added); \n(12) \u201cprovide that, in determining whether an \nindividual is blind, there shall be an \nexamination by a physician skilled in the \ndiseases of the eye or by an optometrist, \nwhichever \nthe \nindividual \nmay \nselect,\u201d \n1396a(a)(12) (emphasis added); \n(32) \u201cprovide that no payment under the plan for \nany care or service provided to an individual \nshall be made to anyone other than such \nindividual or the person or institution \nproviding such care or service,\u201d barring \ncertain exceptions, 1396a(a)(32) (emphasis \nadded); \n(34) \u201cprovide that in the case of any individual \nwho has been determined to be eligible for \nmedical assistance under the plan, such \nassistance will be made available to him for \ncare and services included under the plan \nand furnished in or after the third month \n\n39 \n \nbefore the month in which he made \napplication (or application was made on his \nbehalf in the case of a deceased individual) \nfor such assistance if such individual was (or \nupon application would have been) eligible \nfor such assistance at the time such care and \nservices \nwere \nfurnished,\u201d \n1396a(a)(34) \n(emphasis added); \n(53) \u201cprovide\u2014(A) for notifying in a timely \nmanner all individuals in the State who are \ndetermined to be eligible for medical \nassistance and who are pregnant women, \nbreastfeeding or postpartum women \u2026, or \nchildren below the age of 5, of the availability \nof benefits furnished by the special supple-\nmental \nnutrition \nprogram \nunder \nsuch \nsection,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(A) (emphasis added); \nand \n        \u201c(B) for referring any such individual to the \nState agency responsible for administering \nsuch program,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(B) (emphasis \nadded); \n(84) \u201cprovide that\u2014(A) the State shall not \nterminate eligibility for medical assistance \nunder the State plan \u2026 for an individual who \nis an eligible juvenile \u2026 because the juvenile \nis an inmate of a public institution \u2026,\u201d \n1396a(a)(84)(A) (emphasis added); \n        \u201c(B) in the case of an individual who is an \neligible juvenile \u2026, the State shall, prior to \nthe individual\u2019s release from such a public \ninstitution, conduct a redetermination of \neligibility for such individual with respect to \n\n40 \n \nsuch medical assistance \u2026 and, if the State \ndetermines \u2026 that the individual continues \nto meet the eligibility requirements for such \nmedical assistance, the State shall restore \ncoverage for such medical assistance to such \nan individual upon the individual\u2019s release \nfrom such public institution,\u201d 1396a(a)(84)(B) \n(emphasis added).4 \nEach of these requirements \u201caddresses whether \n\u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients,\u201d Opp.16, \u201cshall\u201d or \n\u201cwill\u201d be given various types of medical assistance, \nproviders, or processes to ensure timely and equal \naccess to that assistance. Given Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemand-\ning bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180, it can\u2019t be true that \nall of them create privately enforceable rights. If it \nwere, then Talevski was hardly the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. \nat 183, and lower courts are free to \u201cfind\u201d private \nrights in innumerable federal statutory provisions. \nWorse, accepting Respondents\u2019 position that a \nprovision\u2019s \u201c\u2018unmistakable focus\u2019 on the benefited \nclass\u201d and its \u201c\u2018phras[ing] in terms of the persons \nbenefited\u2019\u201d is enough to create a private right, Opp.16 \n(cleaned up), would require overruling Suter v. Artist \nM., in its entirety. 503 U.S. 347 (1992). That is exactly \nwhat Congress insisted it was not doing when it \npassed Section 1320a-2. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 (providing \n\u201cthat this section is not intended to alter the holding \nin Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this \ntitle is not enforceable in a private right of action\u201d). \n \n4 Accord 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84)(C), (D) (requiring similar pro-\ncessing of applications for medical assistance submitted by \u201can \nindividual who is an eligible juvenile\u201d described in separate \nsubsections). \n\n41 \n \nThe Adoption Act plan-requirement provision in \nSuter required states to specify that, \u201cin each case, \nreasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the \nplacement of a child in foster care, to prevent or \neliminate the need for removal of the child from his \nhome, and (B) to make it possible for the child to \nreturn to his home.\u201d Suter, 503 U.S. at 351 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 671(a)(15)) (emphasis added). And yet, the \nCourt held that provision did not \u201cconfer[ ] an enforce-\nable private right on its beneficiaries\u201d even though it \nconferred a benefit and identified the benefited \nindividuals (\u201ca child\u201d and \u201cthe child\u201d in foster care). \nId. at 364. A \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement\u2014like a \nstate\u2019s substantial-compliance requirement to allow \nMedicaid recipients to choose a qualified provider\u2014\n\u201cis at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather \ngeneralized duty on the State, to be enforced not by \nprivate individuals, but by the Secretary.\u201d Id. at 363. \nIn recent decades, this Court has reined in the \n\u201cready implication\u201d of privately enforceable rights. \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. It should not return \nto \u201cthe heady days in which [it] assumed common-law \npowers to create causes of action.\u201d Corr. Servs. Corp. \nv. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 75 (2001) (Scalia J., \nconcurring). Accepting that invitation would subject \nstates to countless suits under a myriad of federal \nstatutes\u2014all without congressional approval. \n2. Finding a private right in the any-\nqualified-provider provision creates \ncontradictions and problems.  \nAdditional practical reasons weigh strongly \nagainst finding a private right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \n\n42 \n \nFirst, Respondents\u2019 position steals the discretion \nthat Congress vested in the Secretary through the \nsubstantial-compliance statute. Under the Medicaid \nAct, the Secretary is charged with interpretation and \nenforcement, including deciding whether a state\u2019s \nadministration of its plan is substantially compliant \nin its treatment of \u201cqualified\u201d providers. Yet under \nRespondents\u2019 theory, that administrative discretion is \nreassigned to federal district courts across the \ncountry issuing injunctions in Section 1983 actions.  \nSecond, a provider has a remedy for exclusion. It \ncan file an administrative appeal followed by state-\ncourt review and, if necessary, review by this Court. \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. 1002.213; S.C. \nCode Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154; S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 1-23-380. Providers may balk at having to \npursue an administrative remedy. But no one is \ncontending that state-court review followed by a \npetition for certiorari is an inadequate backstop. \nWhat\u2019s more, to suggest that Congress also \nintended beneficiaries to have a simultaneous right to \nsue in federal court to challenge such a decision is, to \nsay the least, \u201ca curious system for review of a State\u2019s \ndetermination that a Medicaid provider is not \n\u2018qualified.\u2019\u201d Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041\u201342. And \nbecause there\u2019s no reason that a judicial affirmance of \na disqualification decision would have preclusive ef-\nfect on a beneficiary\u2019s federal claim, this \u201cgives \u2026 \nfurther reason to doubt that Congress \u2026 unambigu-\nously created an enforceable federal right\u201d here. Ibid. \nRelatedly, it makes sense to infer a private right \nin the FNHRA context, where the resident and his \nnursing home may have adverse interests. See \n\n43 \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 172\u201374. It makes far less sense \nhere, where the beneficiary is protected by the \nprovider\u2019s exercise of its appeal rights. That may \nexplain why FNHRA has a savings clause, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(h)(8), while Section 1396a does not. \nThird, a ruling for Respondents would clash with \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s requirement that a state plan \n\u201cprovide \u2026 an opportunity for a fair hearing before \nthe State agency to any individual whose claim for \nmedical assistance under the plan is denied.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(3). It would be strange for Congress \nto create an express administrative remedy for bene-\nficiaries to challenge their own eligibility while \nauthorizing those beneficiaries sub silentio to go to \nfederal court to challenge a provider\u2019s eligibility.  \nFourth, Respondents say that Medicaid benefi-\nciaries need a private right of action to preserve broad \naccess to healthcare. But nothing is further from the \ntruth. South Carolinians in the Medicaid program \nhave access to plenty of providers. See supra, pp. 9\u2013\n11. And any excluded providers have an administra-\ntive remedy and judicial review to preserve their par-\nticipation in the program.  \nFinally, accepting Respondents\u2019 position would \nsubject states to innumerable lawsuits and accom-\npanying attorney-fee awards\u2014all without the clear \nnotice that the Spending Clause requires. And that \nproblem is not limited to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision. Lower courts that fail to follow this Court\u2019s \nguidance have found a vast array of private rights \nenforceable under Section 1983. \n \n\n44 \n \nLimiting the survey just to 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a), \nthese lawsuits have included healthcare providers \nchallenging a state\u2019s notice-and-comment process for \nsetting payment rates, e.g., BT Bourbonnais Care, \nLLC v. Norwood, 866 F.3d 815, 824 (7th Cir. 2017) \n(applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A)); individuals \ncontesting how promptly they received medical \nassistance, e.g., Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 355\u201357 \n(4th Cir. 2007) (applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(8)); and \nbeneficiaries challenging eligibility decisions, e.g., \nBontrager v. Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin., 697 \nF.3d 604, 606\u201307 (7th Cir. 2012) (applying 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(10)). The cost of these federal lawsuits is not \neasily quantified. But there is no doubt that such \nlawsuits will drain state Medicaid coffers at the \nexpense of needy families and children\u2014harming the \nvery people the Medicaid Act is supposed to help. \nIn sum, the any-qualified-provider provision lacks \nthe kind of unambiguous rights-creating language \nthat this Court demands to recognize a private right \nenforceable by Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s \nstructure counsels strongly against recognizing a \nprivate right. And the practical ramifications of \nfinding a private right in Section 1396a(a)(23) are so \ndisconcerting and irrational that the Court should not \nimpute them to Congress. \n \n \n\n45 \n \nII. The Court need not overrule any cases, but \nit should clarify that it has abandoned Bless-\ning\u2019s factors and cabined Wilder and Wright. \nThe Court in Gonzaga and Talevski emphasized \nthe clear-rights-creating-language requirement to \nensure that lower courts do not loosely imply private \nrights enforceable through Section 1983. Yet despite \nthis Court\u2019s best efforts, lower courts have been slow \nto implement these instructions. As the decision \nbelow proves, \u201ceven after\u201d Talevski, some lower courts \nstill feel they \u201clack the guidance inferior judges need.\u201d \nPet.App.35a\u201336a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment). So the Court should provide it now. \nBlessing, Wilder, and Wright continue to sow \nconfusion, as Judge Richardson\u2019s concurrences prove. \nPet.App.35a\u201336a, 65a, 120a\u201325a. In Wilder, the \nCourt looked \u201cbeyond the unambiguous terms of the \nstatute\u201d \nand \nrelied \non \n\u201cpolicy \nconsiderations \npurportedly derived from legislative history and \nsuperseded versions of the statute\u201d to find a privately \nenforceable right. 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., \ndissenting). Blessing reached a different result, but it \nis remembered more for its distillation of \u201cthree \nfactors,\u201d 520 U.S. at 340, from Wilder and Wright. \nCourts and litigants alike have unfortunately read all \nthree cases as \u201cestablish[ing] a relatively loose \nstandard for finding rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282.  \nAttempting to set the record straight, Gonzaga \ndisavowed any reading of Blessing, Wilder, and \nWright that might \u201csuggest that something less than \nan unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Ibid. And in assessing whether FERPA\u2019s \n\n46 \n \nprovisions created privately enforceable rights, the \nCourt did not apply the Blessing factors. Id. at 287\u2013\n90. In fact, when Justice Stevens argued in dissent \nthat separation of powers would be better served by \nthe Blessing test, id. at 300\u201302 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning), the majority countered that it \u201cfail[ed] to see how \nrelations between the branches are served by having \ncourts apply a multifactor balancing test to pick and \nchoose which federal requirements may be enforced \nby \u00a7 1983 and which may not,\u201d id. at 286. \nTurning to Wilder and Wright, the Gonzaga Court \nnoted that in both cases, Congress had \u201cexplicitly \nconferred specific monetary entitlements upon the \nplaintiffs.\u201d Id. at 280. In contrast, the student \nplaintiff \u2019s attempt to find a federally enforceable right \nin FERPA was \u201ca far cry from the sort of individu-\nalized, concrete monetary entitlement found enforce-\nable\u201d in Wilder and Wright. Id. at 288 n.6. Years later, \nthe Armstrong majority took specific aim at Wilder, \nobserving that \u201clater opinions\u201d like Gonzaga \u201cplainly \nrepudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action \nthat Wilder exemplified.\u201d 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. \nMore recently, this Court\u2019s decision in Talevski \nreaffirmed Gonzaga\u2019s analysis. All nine Justices \njoined opinions confirming that Gonzaga establishes \nthe \u201ctest for determining whether a particular federal \nlaw actually secures rights for \u00a7 1983 purposes.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 175; id. at 183 (\u201cGonzaga sets \nforth our established method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral.\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) \n(\u201cGonzaga \nsets \nthe \nstandard \nfor \ndetermining when a Spending Clause statute confers \nindividual rights\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(Gonzaga sets forth the Court\u2019s \u201cestablished method\u201d) \n\n47 \n \n(cleaned up). And all nine Justices agreed Gonzaga\u2019s \nunambiguous-conferral test sets a \u201chigh\u201d and \n\u201cdemanding bar.\u201d Id. at 180; id. at 184 (\u201csignificant \nhurdle\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar \nis high\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \n\u201cwith the Court\u2019s understanding of the high bar\u201d). \nDespite that unanimity, the Court left some \nthings unsaid. And the Fourth Circuit used that \nsilence to double down on its prior opinions after \nTalevski. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. \nFirst, while Talevski did not apply the Blessing \nfactors, it did not overrule Blessing or expressly \ndisavow its test.5 So on remand, the Fourth Circuit \nreasoned that while Talevski had \u201cshed some new \nlight on Blessing,\u201d it was not for the court \u201cto proclaim \na Supreme Court precedent [had been] overthrown.\u201d \nPet.App.21a\u201322a. The court expected at least \u201csome \ndiscussion of Blessing had it been jettisoned,\u201d so it felt \nthat it \u201cremain[ed] bound by Blessing until given \nexplicit instructions to the contrary\u2014instructions \nthat have yet to come.\u201d Ibid. \nSecond, although Talevski did not cite Wright or \nWilder, it didn\u2019t overrule them either. So the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s most recent decision continued to rely on \nWilder. In the court\u2019s view, Wilder had \u201calready held \nthat a different funding condition\u201d in Section 1396a(a) \n\u201cconfers individual rights enforceable via\u201d Section \n \n5 But see The Supreme Court 2022 Term, 42 U.S.C. 1983 \u2013 \nSpending Clause \u2013 Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 380, 388 (2023) (observing that the \nTalevski \u201cmajority affirmed the Seventh Circuit while silently \nabandoning the very test the Seventh Circuit believed \ngoverned,\u201d namely Blessing\u2019s three-factored test). \n\n48 \n \n1983. Pet.App.27a. So the Fourth Circuit thought that \nWilder \u201cappear[ed] to doom the State\u2019s argument\u201d \nthat the any-qualified-provider provision is not \nprivately enforceable because it focuses on govern-\nment officials overseeing funding. Ibid. And the court \ndid not believe that the Armstrong majority had effec-\ntively overruled Wilder, insisting instead that \u201c[t]he \nserious business of spurning a precedent cannot be \nprecipitated by winks and nods.\u201d Pet.App.28a. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Court should make \nclear that it has abandoned the Blessing test that \nsome lower courts still feel bound to apply \u201ceven after\u201d \nTalevski. Pet.App.35a. See, e.g., Saint Anthony Hosp. \nv. Whitehorn, 100 F.4th 767, 779 (7th Cir. 2024) \n(noting that Talevski did not \u201cdisapprove of Blessing\u201d \nand claiming not to \u201csee a fundamental difference \nbetween the Talevski/Gonzaga standard \u2026 and the \nfirst and third Blessing factors\u201d), reh\u2019g granted and \nopinion vacated, No. 21-2325, 2024 WL 3561942 (7th \nCir.

N.J., 93 F.4th 122, 130 (3d Cir. 2024) (observing \nthat this Court \u201chas not expressly held that the \nBlessing factors are no longer relevant\u201d and applying \nthose factors in a footnote). \nThe Court did something similar in Kennedy v. \nBremerton School District, 597 U.S. 507 (2022). \nThere, the Court clarified \u201cthat the shortcomings \nassociated with [the] ambitious, abstract, and \nahistorical approach to the Establishment Clause\u201d \nadopted in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), \nhad become \u201cso apparent\u201d that the Court had \u201clong \nago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test \noffshoot.\u201d Id. at 534 (cleaned up). \n\n49 \n \nBefore Kennedy, \u201c[t]he Court [had] explained that \nthese tests [had] invited chaos in lower courts, led to \ndiffering results in materially identical cases, and \ncreated a minefield for legislators.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). \nAnd more recently, the Court had rejected Lemon-\nbased arguments while, \u201c[i]n place of Lemon and the \nendorsement test,\u201d instructing \u201cthat the Establish-\nment Clause must be interpreted by reference to \nhistorical practices and understandings.\u201d Id. at 535\u2013\n36 (cleaned up). That focus had \u201clong represented the \nrule rather than some exception within the Court\u2019s \nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence.\u201d Id. at 536 \n(cleaned up). And the lower courts had \u201cerred by \nfailing to heed this guidance.\u201d Ibid. \nSo too here. This Court has not applied Blessing\u2019s \nthree factors since Blessing itself. 520 U.S. at 340\u201341. \nAnd even in Blessing, the Court merely said that they \nwere the \u201cthree factors\u201d the Court had \u201ctraditionally \nlooked at \u2026 when determining whether a particular \nstatutory provision gives rise to a federal right.\u201d Id. at \n340. That framing is more descriptive than pre-\nscriptive. And it is no longer an accurate description \nof what this Court considers in this context. \nWhat\u2019s more, in acknowledging the \u201cconfusion\u201d \nand \u201cuncertainty\u201d Blessing has wrought, this Court \nhas rejected Blessing-based arguments, confirming \nthat its cases do not \u201cpermit anything short of an \nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of \naction brought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n282\u201383. Given all this, the Court should clarify, much \nlike it did in Kennedy, that it has \u201clong ago abandoned \n[Blessing] and its [three-factor] test.\u201d Kennedy, 597 \nU.S. at 534. \n\n50 \n \nThe Court also should clarify that Wilder and \nWright are limited to the unique monetary-entitle-\nment-conferring provisions at issue there. Despite \nthis Court saying that its \u201copinions plainly repudiate \nthe ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder \nexemplified,\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*, that was \nnot enough for the court below, Pet.App.27a\u201328a. And \nwhile Gonzaga cabined Wilder and Wright to cases \ninvolving spending provisions that \u201cexplicitly confer[ ] \nspecific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs,\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 288 n.6, the court below \nrelied on Wilder anyway, Pet.App.15a\u201316a, 27a.  \nAgain, this Court has done something similar in \nthe Establishment Clause context. Three Terms ago, \nthe Court explained that Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 \n(2004), \u201ccannot be read beyond its narrow focus on \nvocational religious degrees.\u201d Carson ex rel. O. C. v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 789 (2022). The Court should \nsimilarly clarify here that Wilder and Wright \u201ccannot \nbe read beyond [their] narrow focus,\u201d ibid., on \u201cthe \nsort of individualized, concrete monetary entitlement \nfound enforceable\u201d in those cases, Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 288 n.6. \nFinally, while the Court need not overrule \nBlessing, Wilder, or Wright to reverse the decision \nbelow, if the Court concludes more is required to guide \nlower courts, the Court should overrule all three. \n\u201cStare decisis is not an inexorable command, and the \nstare decisis considerations most relevant here\u2014the \nquality of the precedent\u2019s reasoning, the workability \nof the rule it established, and reliance on the \ndecision\u2014all weigh in favor of letting [all three \ndecisions] go.\u201d Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 \nU.S. 369, 407 (2024) (cleaned up). \n\n51 \n \n1. On the quality of the reasoning, Talevski \ncommands courts to \u201cemploy traditional tools of statu-\ntory construction to assess whether Congress has \nunambiguously conferred individual rights upon a \nclass of beneficiaries to which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d \n599 U.S. at 183 (cleaned up). But in Blessing, Wilder, \nand Wright, the Court did not use traditional tools of \nstatutory interpretation, nor did it ask whether \nCongress had unambiguously conferred a right. The \nCourt asked mainly whether Congress had imposed a \nmandatory benefit. See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341 \n(asking whether Congress imposed \u201ca binding \nobligation\u201d); Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509\u201310 (looking only \nfor mandatory benefits); Wright, 479 U.S. at 430\u201331 \n(same). That never should have been enough. See \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting); \nWright, 479 U.S. at 434 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). \n2. This trio of cases has also proven unworkable. \nAs shown by the decision below and the 5\u20132 circuit \nsplit, Wilder and Wright, along with Blessing\u2019s three-\nfactored test, have sown chaos and confusion in the \nlower courts. This Court tried to \u201cresolve [that] \nambiguity\u201d in Gonzaga. 536 U.S. at 278. But it didn\u2019t \nwork. \u201cVirtually all the circuits refused to read \nGonzaga as repudiating Blessing.\u201d The Supreme \nCourt 2022 Term, 137 Harv. L. Rev. at 388 (collecting \ncases). \u201cMany interpreted Gonzaga as merely glossing \nBlessing\u2019s first prong and began applying this \n\u2018Blessing-Gonzaga test\u2019 as controlling law.\u201d Ibid. \n(cleaned up) (collecting cases). Others \u201cread Gonzaga \nas providing merely \u2018principles\u2019 courts should keep \n\u2018firmly in mind\u2019 as they apply the \u2018Blessing test.\u2019\u201d Ibid. \n(quoting N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Child. v. Poole, \n922 F.3d 69, 79 (2d Cir. 2019)). \n\n52 \n \n3. This confusion means \u201carguments for reliance \n\u2026 are misplaced.\u201d S. Dakota v. Wayfair, 585 U.S. 162, \n186 (2018). \u201cThis is especially so because\u201d Congress, \nthe states, and private parties \u201chave been on notice \nfor years regarding this Court\u2019s misgivings\u201d about all \nthree cases. Janus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., and \nMun. Emps., Council 31, 585 U.S. 878, 927 (2018). \nAlso, Congress repealed the amendment in Wilder \n\u201cand replaced it with narrower language\u201d to give the \nstates more flexibility. Long Term Care Pharmacy All. \nv. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2004).  \nIn short, given how badly their \u201cdoctrinal under-\npinnings have \u2026 eroded,\u201d how \u201cunworkable\u201d they\u2019ve \nproved, Kimble v. Marvel Ent., LLC, 576 U.S. 446, \n458\u201359 (2015), and how little reliance exists, the \nCourt would be justified in overruling all three cases. \nIII. Reversal would respect separation of pow-\ners and enable states to better steward \nscarce Medicaid resources. \n\u201cUnder the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, \nCongress and the President may update the law to \nmeet modern policy priorities and needs.\u201d Arizona v. \nNavajo Nation, 599 U.S. 555, 566 (2023). \u201cBut it is not \nthe Judiciary\u2019s role to update the law.\u201d Ibid. And it is \n\u201cparticularly important that the federal courts not do \nso\u201d in cases involving the allocation of scarce resour-\nces that leave states in a \u201czero-sum situation.\u201d Ibid. \nIn Navajo Nation, that resource was \u201cwater in the \narid regions of the American West.\u201d Ibid. Here, it\u2019s \nMedicaid dollars. \u201cAnd the zero-sum reality\u201d of both \n\u201cunderscores that courts must stay in their proper \nconstitutional lane and interpret the law \u2026 according \n\n53 \n \nto its text and history, leaving to Congress and the \nPresident\u201d the task of updating the law in light of \n\u201ccompeting contemporary needs.\u201d Id. at 567. \nThe Medicaid program is expensive for states. \n\u201cOn average, states spend 29% of their annual \nbudgets on costs related to Medicaid.\u201d Br. of Amici \nCuriae U.S. Senators and Representatives at 12, July \n5, 2024. \u201cThat makes Medicaid the costliest expendi-\nture for many state budgets.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). \n(Medicaid is a 24.3% share of South Carolina\u2019s state \nbudget. South Carolina At-a-Glance, State Health \nAccess Data Assistance Center, perma.cc/X3VL-\n25WT).  \nWhen federal courts discover private rights \nburied in state plan requirements, those costs \nincrease exponentially. \u201cAuthorizing lawsuits by \npatients to challenge their providers\u2019 terminations \nburdens state agencies with redundant and intrusive \noversight while the high cost of federal litigation \ndisplaces more efficient uses of state resources.\u201d \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventive Health Servs. v. Smith, 913 F.3d 551, 571 \n(5th \nCir. \n2019) \n(Jones, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nAnd \nRespondents\u2019 position creates the \u201cthreat of a federal \nlawsuit\u2014and its attendant costs and fees\u2014whenever \n[a state makes] changes\u201d to its list of qualified \nproviders. Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, \nInc., 586 U.S. 1057, 1058 (2018) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting from the denial of cert.). Even just the \nthreat of litigation can impose real costs on real \npeople as the \u201clooming potential for complex litigation \ninevitably will dissuade state officials from making \ndecisions that they believe to be in the public \ninterest.\u201d Ibid. \n\n54 \n \nThe scope of such litigation is staggering. In a \n2020 report, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General reported \nmore than 9,000 terminated Medicaid providers in its \ndatabase. Department of Health & Human Services \nOffice of the Inspector General, States Could Do More \nTo Prevent Terminated Providers From Serving \nMedicaid \nBeneficiaries \nat \n7 \n(Mar. \n2020), \nperma.cc/9JLQ-J696. Under Respondents\u2019 theory, \nbeneficiaries in each state have a right to file a \nSection 1983 lawsuit that seeks the reinstatement of \nevery one of those providers\u2014plus damages and \nattorney fees. \nThe problem is exponentially worse when consid-\nering more than just qualified-provider litigation. \nGiven the broader questions this case implicates, the \nCourt\u2019s decision could impact the costs imposed on \nstates across a host of federal spending programs. In \nthe adoption-and-foster-care context, for example, \nJudge Livingston has raised the alarm that\u2014under \nthe kinds of arguments that Respondents raise here\u2014\nstate foster-care programs face an \u201cunfortunate and \nunsupportable risk of increased litigation\u201d under the \nAdoption \nAssistance \nand \nChild \nWelfare \nAct, \n\u201cinconsistent results\u201d in those cases, \u201cand disorderly \nadministration, none of which will inure to those \nprograms\u2019 benefit.\u201d Poole, 922 F.3d at 95 (Livingston, \nJ., dissenting) (cleaned up). That \u201craises the prospect \nthat scarce foster care resources, instead of going to \nfoster children, will be squandered in litigation \ndestined to produce arbitrary and inconsistent \nresults.\u201d Id. at 97. If those costs are to be imposed on \nstates, that choice is best left to the people\u2019s elected \nrepresentatives in Congress. \n\n55 \n \n* * * \nNothing in the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext or structure unambiguously expresses congres-\nsional intent to confer a federal private right on \nanyone. To hold otherwise would encroach upon the \nexecutive and legislative branches\u2019 prerogatives while \nincreasing the cost to the states of providing medical \ncare to their neediest citizens. And doing so would \ndrop Gonzaga\u2019s supposedly \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d 599 \nU.S. at 180, to the floor. Because the text and \nstructure of the any-qualified-provider provision do \nnot present the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. at 183, that provi-\nsion does not create private rights enforceable under \nSection 1983.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the courts of appeals should be \nreversed. \n        Respectfully submitted, \nFEBRUARY 2025 \n \nKELLY M.

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model is significantly updated by the respondents' Brief in Opposition to the petition for certiorari. While this is not their full merits brief, it reveals their core legal strategy and provides the first direct rebuttal to the arguments from the petitioner and the Solicitor General (SG). My prior belief, anchored by the SG's influential amicus brief, strongly favored reversal. This new observation introduces a credible, text-focused counter-narrative that makes the case more competitive.\n\nMy updated beliefs now incorporate the central clash of arguments:\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (Petitioner/SG Position):** The powerful argument for reversal remains stable. It is based on the SG's interpretation of *Health & Hosp. Corp. v. Talevski* as establishing a high bar for private enforcement. The core of this position is a structural argument: the \"any-qualified-provider\" provision (\u00a7 1396a(a)(23)) is just one of 87 administrative requirements in a section not explicitly labeled \"rights.\" This placement, they argue, fails to provide the \"unambiguous notice\" to States required under *Pennhurst* and *Gonzaga* that they were consenting to private lawsuits, especially when the primary enforcement mechanism is the Secretary of HHS withholding funds.\n\n2.  **New Information (Respondent's Counter-Argument):** The respondents, represented by experienced Supreme Court counsel, are not attempting to sideline *Talevski*. Instead, they are embracing it, arguing that the Fourth Circuit's decision is *consistent* with *Talevski*. Their strategy, as revealed in the brief, is to focus intently on the specific text of the provision itself, rather than its location in the statute.\n    *   **Text as \"Unambiguous Rights-Creating\" Language:** The respondents' central claim is that the statutory text\u2014\"any individual eligible for medical assistance... may obtain such assistance from any institution\" that is \"qualified\"\u2014is the epitome of the \"rights-creating\" language required by *Gonzaga* and affirmed in *Talevski*. They argue this phrasing has an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" (the individual patient), directly satisfying the Court's test.\n    *   ***Talevski* as a Favorable Analogy:** The respondents frame *Talevski* not as a new obstacle, but as a decision that \"bolstered\" their position by providing examples of similar rights-creating language that the Court found to be enforceable.\n    *   **Factual Framing:** The brief repeatedly emphasizes that South Carolina does not dispute that Planned Parenthood is a \"qualified\" provider. This frames the state's action as an arbitrary exclusion based on reasons outside the statute's own terms, strengthening the patient's claim that her statutory right to choose any *qualified* provider is being violated.\n    *   **Lower Court Consensus:** The respondents highlight that the Fourth Circuit has affirmed this right three times, with unanimous agreement on the panel (including from Judge Richardson, a conservative appointee) even after being instructed to reconsider the case in light of *Talevski*. They will use this to argue that the right is indeed \"unambiguous.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesized Understanding & Remaining Uncertainty:** The core legal battle is now sharply defined. It is a clash between two competing applications of the *Talevski*/*Gonzaga* framework:\n    *   **Petitioner/SG View:** A structuralist interpretation where the provision's location and the statute's overall enforcement scheme are dispositive.\n    *   **Respondent View:** A textualist interpretation where the specific, individual-focused wording of the provision itself is dispositive.\n\nMy confidence in a straightforward reversal has decreased. The respondents have a strong, text-based argument that directly engages with the Court's most recent precedent. The outcome will likely hinge on which interpretive methodology the majority of the Court prioritizes in this context. The key uncertainty is no longer what the respondents will argue, but rather whether the Court will favor the petitioner's structural/holistic view of the Medicaid Act or the respondents' textual/provision-specific reading.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model is further refined by the petitioner's merits brief, which provides a full articulation of their legal strategy. My previous belief, formed after seeing the respondents' brief in opposition, was that the case presented a competitive clash between a structural and a textual interpretation of the *Talevski*/*Gonzaga* framework. The petitioner's merits brief does not change this fundamental conflict, but it sharpens their line of attack significantly, providing the Court with a clear, restrictive, and potentially decisive rule for resolving the case. My confidence in a reversal has consequently increased.\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (The Core Conflict):** The central legal battle remains a clash between two competing applications of the *Talevski*/*Gonzaga* framework for finding private rights of action in Spending Clause statutes.\n    *   **Petitioner's Structural View:** The argument that the provision's location within a long, undifferentiated list of 87 administrative \"Contents\" in \u00a7 1396a(a) and the statute's primary enforcement mechanism (the Secretary withholding funds) preclude a finding of an \"unambiguous\" private right remains a core pillar of their case.\n    *   **Respondent's Textual View:** The counter-argument, which I anticipate will be fully developed in their own merits brief, remains stable: that the specific statutory text\u2014\"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance from any... qualified [provider]\"\u2014is the kind of individual-focused, \"rights-creating\" language that satisfies the Court's test, regardless of its location.\n\n2.  **New Information (Petitioner's Refined Argument):** The petitioner's brief moves beyond a general structural argument and proposes a specific, bright-line test for what constitutes \"unambiguous rights-creating language.\" This is a major new development. They argue that to clear the \"demanding bar\" set by *Talevski*, the statutory text must contain one of two features:\n    *   **Explicit Use of the Word \"Right\":** The petitioner makes a powerful and simple distinction by contrasting the Medicaid provision with the FNHRA provisions at issue in *Talevski*. They repeatedly emphasize that FNHRA explicitly labels its provisions as \"rights\" (e.g., a \"right to be free from\" restraints, a section on \"Transfer and discharge rights,\" and even a \"right to choose a personal attending physician\"). The absence of the word \"right\" in the \"any-qualified-provider\" provision is presented as dispositive evidence that Congress did not unambiguously intend to create a privately enforceable right.\n    *   **Use of Constitutional-Style Language:** As a second category, they point to statutes like Title VI and Title IX, whose language (\"No person... shall... be subjected to discrimination\") mirrors the phrasing of rights-conferring provisions in the U.S. Constitution.\n    *   This two-pronged test is designed to give the Court a clear, narrow, and easily applicable rule to cabin the creation of implied rights of action in Spending Clause statutes going forward.\n\n3.  **New Information (Petitioner's Factual & Procedural Framing):** The petitioner's brief also works to reframe the factual and procedural posture of the case.\n    *   **Defining \"Qualified\":** The brief directly contests the respondents' narrative by asserting that South Carolina *deemed* Planned Parenthood \"unqualified.\" This shifts the legal question from whether a patient can choose any *qualified* provider to whether the *State* has the authority to set the terms of qualification, including excluding abortion providers on policy grounds.\n    *   **Alternative Remedy:** They emphasize that South Carolina law provides an administrative and state-court review process for providers who are terminated, and that Planned Parenthood contractually agreed this was its \"exclusive remedy.\" This frames the federal lawsuit as an improper attempt to bypass the state's established statutory scheme.\n\n4.  **Synthesized Understanding & Remaining Uncertainty:** My understanding of the legal landscape is now much sharper. The petitioner is not just arguing for a win on the facts; they are explicitly asking the Court to \"clarify that it has abandoned *Blessing\u2019s* factors and cabined *Wilder* and *Wright*,\" the older precedents that were more permissive in finding private rights. They are seeking a broad doctrinal cleanup.\n\nThe central clash is no longer just \"structure vs. text.\" It is now a clash between the respondent's focus on the general meaning of the provision's text versus the petitioner's proposed bright-line rule that \"unambiguous\" requires the *specific word \"right\"* or constitutional phrasing. The petitioner's argument is elegant in its simplicity and offers the Court's conservative majority a clear path to reversal that appears grounded in the precedent of *Talevski* itself.\n\nMy confidence in a reversal has increased because the petitioner has provided a compelling and restrictive framework that aligns with the Court's recent skepticism toward implied rights of action. The key uncertainty is now whether a majority of the Court will adopt this strict, formalistic test or whether they will find that the phrase \"any individual... may obtain\" is sufficient on its own to unambiguously confer a right, even without the magic word. The respondents' task is now not just to defend their reading of the text, but to convince the Court not to adopt the petitioner's bright-line rule.",

In either scenario, the change in my posterior belief distribution will be massive.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.  It has no parent \ncorporation, and no publicly held corporation owns ten \npercent or more of its stock.\n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ........................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ................................................................. 1 \nStatement ................................................................... 2 \nArgument .................................................................. 11 \nI. \nThe Private-Right-Of-Action Issue Does \nNot Warrant This Court\u2019s Review ................ 12 \nII. \nThe Unqualified-Provider Issue Does \nNot Warrant This Court\u2019s Review ................ 25 \nConclusion ................................................................ 30 \n \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \n \nCases \nPage(s) \nAkula v.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal monologue, a meta-level reflection on the current state of my knowledge and a plan for future action. It does not introduce any new external evidence, facts, or arguments related to the case itself. It serves to confirm and synthesize the significant impact of the petitioner's merits brief, which was processed in the previous update, and to highlight the primary source of remaining uncertainty\u2014the lack of the respondent's counter-arguments.\n\nTherefore, my task-level beliefs remain stable, as no new information directly informing the prediction has been received. My current understanding, which has been significantly shaped by the petitioner's brief, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (The Core Conflict):** The case remains centered on the *Talevski*/*Gonzaga* framework for identifying private rights of action in Spending Clause statutes. The fundamental tension is between a structural interpretation (favored by the petitioner) and a textual one (favored by the respondent).\n    *   **Petitioner's Structural View:** The argument that the \"any qualified provider\" provision is buried in a long list of administrative requirements (\u00a7 1396a(a)) and that the statute's primary enforcement mechanism is administrative (withholding of funds by the HHS Secretary) continues to be a central pillar of the petitioner's case.\n    *   **Respondent's Textual View:** The anticipated counter-argument remains that the specific text\u2014\"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance from any... qualified [provider]\"\u2014is the kind of individual-focused, \"rights-creating\" language that satisfies the Court's test on its own terms.\n\n2.  **Solidified Understanding (Petitioner's Refined Argument):** My understanding of the petitioner's strategy, gained from their merits brief, is now a core part of my predictive model. They have proposed a clear, restrictive, and potentially dispositive two-pronged test for what constitutes \"unambiguous rights-creating language.\" This test requires the statutory text to feature either:\n    *   **Explicit Use of the Word \"Right\":** The petitioner draws a sharp contrast with the FNHRA provisions in *Talevski*, which explicitly used the word \"right\" (e.g., \"right to be free from,\" \"Transfer and discharge rights\"). The absence of this word in the Medicaid provision is framed as a fatal flaw for the respondent's claim.\n    *   **Constitutional-Style Phrasing:** Alternatively, they argue the text must mirror the language of constitutional provisions or statutes like Title VI/IX (\"No person... shall... be subjected to discrimination\").\n    *   This test is a significant development because it offers the Court a simple, formalistic rule to limit implied rights of action, aligning with the conservative majority's recent jurisprudence and their stated goal of providing clarity.\n\n3.  **Solidified Understanding (Petitioner's Factual & Procedural Framing):** I have also integrated the petitioner's framing of the case's context into my model.\n    *   **The Meaning of \"Qualified\":** The petitioner asserts that South Carolina's action was a determination that Planned Parenthood was \"unqualified,\" thereby shifting the legal focus from a patient's right to choose to the State's authority to define qualification.\n    *   **Alternative Remedies:** They highlight that Planned Parenthood had access to a state-level administrative and judicial review process, which they contractually agreed was their \"exclusive remedy,\" framing the federal lawsuit as an improper circumvention of this state scheme.\n\n4.  **Synthesized Understanding & Remaining Uncertainty:** My confidence in a reversal for the petitioner is high, based on the strength and simplicity of their proposed bright-line rule. They have provided the Court with a clear, doctrinally-grounded path to not only reverse the Fourth Circuit but also to significantly \"cabin\" older, more permissive precedents like *Wilder* and *Wright*. The central uncertainty is now sharply defined: will the Court adopt the petitioner's restrictive, formalistic test (requiring the word \"right\" or constitutional phrasing), or will a majority find that the phrase \"any individual... may obtain\" is, by itself, sufficient to unambiguously confer a privately enforceable right? The entire case now seems to hinge on the persuasiveness of the respondent's forthcoming arguments against this specific, narrow test.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for a writ of certiorari. This document predates the Supreme Court's GVR (Grant, Vacate, Remand) in light of *Talevski* and, crucially, predates the petitioner's merits brief. While it is not the direct response to the petitioner's most current arguments, it provides the foundational legal and factual arguments for the respondent's case, confirming some prior assumptions and adding significant detail to their expected strategy.\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (The Core Conflict & Petitioner's Strategy):** My understanding of the central legal conflict and the petitioner's refined arguments remains the core of my predictive model.\n    *   **The *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* Framework:** The case still hinges on whether the \"any qualified provider\" provision contains \"unambiguously conferred rights\" enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n    *   **Petitioner's Restrictive Test:** The petitioner's two-pronged test\u2014requiring either the explicit word \"right\" or constitutional-style phrasing (\"No person shall...\")\u2014remains the most significant offensive legal argument in the case. It offers the Court a clear, formalistic rule to limit private rights of action, which I continue to believe will be attractive to the current majority.\n    *   **Petitioner's Factual & Procedural Framing:** The petitioner's arguments that this case is about the state's power to define \"qualified\" and that the state's administrative process was the \"exclusive remedy\" are still key components of their case.\n\n2.  **New & Solidified Beliefs (Respondent's Foundational Arguments):** The BIO provides the respondent's core counter-narrative and legal position, which I can now integrate into my model.\n    *   **Confirmed Textual Argument:** The BIO confirms that the respondent's primary argument is a direct textual one based on the existing *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework. They argue that the phrase **\"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\"** is the quintessential \"individual-centric\" and \"rights-creating\" language that the Court has consistently recognized. They lean on the Fourth Circuit's forceful conclusion: \"If th[is] language does not suffice to confer a private right... it is difficult to see what language would be adequate.\" This sets up a direct clash with the petitioner's proposed new test, with the respondent defending the sufficiency of the existing standard.\n    *   **New Factual Rebuttal to \"Qualified\" Argument:** The BIO provides a powerful factual rebuttal to the petitioner's attempt to frame this as a case about defining \"qualified.\" The respondent asserts that South Carolina **conceded** that Planned Parenthood was \"perfectly competent\" and \"professionally qualified.\" The termination was explicitly based \"solely because [PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid program.\" This allows the respondent to argue that the petitioner's legal theory about the power to define qualifications is irrelevant to the actual facts of the case, where a concededly qualified provider was terminated for a reason extraneous to the statute.\n    *   **New Rebuttal to \"Alternative Remedy\" Argument:** The BIO directly counters the petitioner's argument that a state administrative process was the \"exclusive remedy.\" They will likely argue this is foreclosed by long-standing \u00a7 1983 precedent, such as *Patsy v. Board of Regents*, which establishes that plaintiffs are generally not required to exhaust state administrative remedies before bringing a \u00a7 1983 suit in federal court.\n    *   **Patient-Centric Framing:** The respondent's narrative is heavily focused on the concrete harm to individual patients, exemplified by the story of Julie Edwards, a diabetic patient for whom pregnancy would be dangerous. This emotional and practical framing contrasts sharply with the petitioner's abstract, structural argument and is designed to show the Court the real-world purpose and effect of the \"free choice\" provision.\n\n3.  **Synthesized Understanding & Refined Uncertainty:** The battle lines are now much clearer. This is not just a simple application of *Talevski*; it is a fight over the future of the *Gonzaga* test itself.\n    *   **Petitioner's Goal:** To convince the Court to *add a new, formalistic gloss* to the *Gonzaga* test (the \"right\" or \"No person shall...\" rule).\n    *   **Respondent's Goal:** To convince the Court that the *existing Gonzaga/Talevski standard is sufficient* and that the statutory text plainly meets it. They will portray the petitioner's proposed rule as a radical, unwarranted departure from established precedent.\n\nMy confidence remains high that the Court will reverse and rule for the petitioner, largely because the simple, bright-line rule they offer is jurisprudentially aligned with the conservative majority's desire to limit implied rights of action. However, I now have a much clearer view of the respondent's path to victory: they must convince a majority that (1) the facts of this case (a concededly qualified provider terminated for political reasons) make it a poor vehicle for the petitioner's broad legal argument, and (2) adopting the petitioner's new test would be an unnecessary and disruptive revision of the Court's own recent precedent in *Talevski*. The primary uncertainty has shifted from *what* the respondent will argue to *whether their defense of the status quo* can overcome the appeal of the petitioner's simple, restrictive, and forward-looking rule. The respondent's merits brief will be crucial in seeing how they directly attack the petitioner's two-pronged test.",

In exchange, \nthe States agree to comply with the terms and \nconditions attached to those funds. Everyone agrees \nthat those terms and conditions must be clear and \nunambiguous when the States accept the money. \nIf the States fail to comply with the conditions set \nby the statute, they can expect to lose the funding. In \naddition, in some instances, they are also open to \nlawsuits from private individuals under the relevant \nstatute itself or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Before an individual \ncan sue and recover under \u00a7 1983, however, he must \nshow that Congress clearly and unambiguously \ncreated an individual right of action that is \nenforceable under that section. \nThe lower courts have been inconsistent as to \nwhen a Spending Clause statute creates a clear and \nunambiguous individual right enforceable under \n\u00a7 1983. Some courts apply a multi-factor test to \ndetermine whether the plain language of a statute \ngrants a right to sue. Others say that that test no \nlonger applies but continue to weigh various factors. \nAs a result, the States often lack proper notice of \nwhether they are at risk of private suit when they \naccept federal funding and are often sued when they \n \n1 Amici States certify that no counsel for a party authored this \nbrief in whole or in part and no person or entity, other than \namici, their members, or their counsel, has made a monetary \ncontribution to its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \ndid not expect to be. This is unconstitutional. And the \ncosts of this litigation are considerable. The States \nmust pay their own costs to litigate whether there is \na right to sue in the first place and, if the court decides \nthere is such a right, to defend themselves. And if they \nlose, they must also pay damages and the plaintiff\u2019s \nattorney\u2019s fees. \nAmici States of Kansas, Alabama, Alaska, \nArkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, \nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and West \nVirginia are interested in clearing the confusion once \nand for all. This Court should hold that nothing short \nof an explicit statement from Congress declaring that \na Spending Clause statute contains a private right of \naction enforceable against the States imparts such a \nright. Accordingly, the Court should reverse the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s decision. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nWhen Congress makes funding available to the \nStates to carry out programs for the general welfare, \nit often attaches terms and conditions to that funding. \nThose conditions must be clear and unambiguous \nwhen the States accept that funding.2 \nIn some cases, Spending Clause statutes may \ncontain, as a condition, an individual right of action \nagainst the States privately enforceable under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In three cases, Wright v. City of \n \n2 Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981). \n \n\n3 \n \nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 \nU.S. 418 (1987), Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), and Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), this Court created a \nmulti-part test to determine whether a federal \nSpending Clause statute creates such a right. \nThis \nmulti-factor \ntest \ninherently \nleads \nto \nuncertainty. That test is, therefore, inconsistent with \nthe rule that terms and conditions attached to federal \nfunding must be clear and unambiguous at the time \nthe funds are accepted. \nAccordingly, in the following decades, this Court \nattempted to tighten the rule in Gonzaga University \nv. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320 (2015), and Health & \nHospital Corporation of Marion County v. Talevski, \n599 U.S. 166 (2023). But the lower courts continue to \napply the multi-factor test. The only difference is that \nnow it is unclear which factors they will apply and \nhow much weight they will give them. \nThis is best evidenced by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision below. The Fourth Circuit applied the multi-\nfactor \nBlessing \ntest \nand \nheld \nthe \nstatute \nunambiguously created a right to sue the State. On \nremand from this Court, the Fourth Circuit decided \nthat some of the factors might no longer be relevant, \napplied just one of them, and came to the same result. \nBy contrast, the Fifth Circuit has looked at the exact \nsame statute and held there is no such right. The Fifth \nCircuit has decided that Congress must do its job, \nholding that the Legislative Branch must clearly say \n\n4 \n \nif there is a right to sue\u2014the constitutionally required \nresult. \nAnything other than an explicit statement from \nCongress that a Spending Clause statute confers a \nprivate right of action enforceable against the States \nunder \u00a7 1983 fails to put the States on notice about \nsuch liability. Because anything less than a clear and \nunambiguous \nstatement \nviolates \nthe \nSpending \nClause, the Court should reverse. \n \nARGUMENT \nThe States accept billions of dollars in federal \nMedicaid funding every year.3 Though they are given \nwide latitude to use those funds, there are some \nrequirements with which they must comply. The \nStates accept that if they do not comply with these \nrequirements, they may lose that the money. But, as \nit stands today, arguably imperfect compliance\u2014a \nresult of a policy decision\u2014may open the States up to \nlawsuits from anyone who arguably benefits from one \nof these programs and suffers as a result of that \ndecision. At the very least, the States must litigate \nwhether the aggrieved person has a right to sue in the \nfirst place. This can take years, if not decades. And if \na court, applying the old (possibly no longer good) \nmulti-factor test decides there is such a right, the \nStates must then continue litigating until it is \ndetermined whether the law has been violated. If they \n \n3  Rebecca Thiess, Kate Watkins & Justin Theal, Record \nFederal Grants to States Keep Federal Share of State Budgets \nHigh, Pew Research (Sept. 10, 2024), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/35ztr64f. \n\n5 \n \nlose, they are open to damages and attorney\u2019s fees. All \nof this is costly. \nI. \nTwenty \nYears \nof \nLitigation \nto \nDetermine Whether a Suit can be \nBrought at All \nWhen a private party sues a State alleging it \nviolated one of his rights under \u00a7 1983, he must show \nhe has a right to sue in the first place. Under existing \nprecedent, that is not a straightforward inquiry. \nThe statute at issue here exemplifies the problem \nperfectly. The statute states: \nA State plan for medical assistance must \nprovide that [] any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance (including drugs) \nmay obtain such assistance from any \ninstitution, \nagency, \ncommunity \npharmacy, \nor \nperson, \nqualified \nto \nperform the service or services required \n(including \nan \norganization \nwhich \nprovides such services, or arranges for \ntheir availability, on a prepayment \nbasis), who undertakes to provide him \nsuch services[.] \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) (the qualified provider \nprovision). Notably absent from the statute is any \nlanguage explicitly stating that if a State determines \na provider is not qualified, any person eligible for \nassistance has a right to sue the State. So, when \n\n6 \n \nseveral States4 determined that Planned Parenthood \nwas not a \u201cqualified provider\u201d and were subsequently \nsued, the first job of the courts was to determine \nwhether those plaintiffs had a right to sue in the first \nplace. \nA look at the litigation in the Fourth and Fifth \nCircuits shows the need for a determinative answer as \nto what counts as a \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunambiguous\u201d right \nto sue under this statute and all others. \na. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Long Road to Nowhere \n \nLouisiana \nIn July 2015, an organization released video \nfootage, taken surreptitiously, allegedly showing staff \nat a Planned Parenthood in Texas sifting through the \nbody parts of aborted children and negotiating the \nsale of those body parts. This footage sparked a \ncongressional investigation. \nLouisiana also launched an investigation into \nPlanned Parenthood facilities operating in the state \nand, one month later, the Louisiana Department of \nHealth and Hospitals decided to terminate its \nagreements with the abortion providers. As per state \nlaw, it gave the organization thirty days to appeal the \ndecision. \nPlanned Parenthood did not appeal through the \nadministrative process. Instead, it sued the State in \nfederal court. Planned Parenthood argued the \n \n4 Including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, \nSouth Carolina, and Texas. \n\n7 \n \nqualified provider provision gave it, or the private \nindividuals who joined the suit, a right to sue the \nState under \u00a7 1983 to reverse the funding decision. \nTwo months later, the Middle District of Louisiana \nagreed, granting an injunction prohibiting the State \nfrom terminating its Medicaid agreements with \nPlanned Parenthood. \nLouisiana appealed. In late 2016, the Fifth Circuit \naffirmed. The unanimous panel began \u201cby joining \nevery other circuit to have addressed this issue to \nconclude that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) affords the Individual \nPlaintiffs a private right of action under \u00a7 1983.\u201d5 \nNine months after that opinion was filed, Judge Owen \nchanged her mind in light of this Court\u2019s decision in \nO\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 \n(1980).6 In her dissent in the superseding opinion, she \nargued that O\u2019Bannon determinatively answered the \nquestion of whether Medicaid patients could challenge \na State\u2019s determination of whether a provider is \n\u201cqualified\u201d under \u00a7 1396a(a)(23): they could not. \n\u201c[P]atients ha[ve] no substantive right to demand care \nfrom a provider that had been decertified, they ha[ve] \nno due process rights to participate in a hearing \nregarding certification or decertification of the \nprovider.\u201d7 \n \n5 Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 837 F.3d 477, \n489 (5th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Circuit had arrived at this \nconclusion in 2006 after two years of litigation. Harris v. \nOlszewski, 442 F.3d 456 (6th Cir. 2006). The Tenth Circuit \nfollowed in 2018. Planned Parenthood of Kan. v. Andersen, 882 \nF.3d 1205 (10th Cir. 2018). \n6 Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 862 F.3d 445, \n476 (5th Cir. 2017) (Owens, J., dissenting). \n7 Id. at 475 (Owens, J., dissenting). \n\n8 \n \nDespite Judge Owen\u2019s dissent and this Court\u2019s \nO\u2019Bannon decision, the Fifth Circuit denied en banc \nreview and this Court denied certiorari. For three \nyears, Gee bound Fifth Circuit States. \nTexas \nAlso in 2015, the Texas Office of the Inspector \nGeneral concluded that the same video footage \nshowed Planned Parenthood violating Texas law, \nincluding prohibitions on the sale of human body \nparts. Based on the unlawful conduct, the State \nconcluded that Planned Parenthood was not a \n\u201cqualified provider\u201d and was no longer eligible to \nparticipate in the State\u2019s Medicaid program. Texas \nterminated its agreements with Planned Parenthood.8 \nRather than challenge the termination though the \nState\u2019s administrative process\u2014which it had a right \nto do\u2014Planned Parenthood joined private individuals \nand sued the State under \u00a7 1983.9 Texas asked for \ndismissal, arguing the qualified provider provision \ndoes not clearly and unambiguously contain a private \nright of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Two years \nlater, the Western District of Texas rejected that \nargument.  Relying solely on Gee, it held that the \nindividual plaintiffs did have such a right to sue when \na provider was determined to no longer be \n\u201cqualified.\u201d10 It then proceeded to find that Texas had \nviolated that right and granted a preliminary \n \n8 See generally Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. \n& Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Smith, 236 F. Supp. 3d 974 \n(W.D. Tex. 2017). \n9 Id. at 977. \n10 Id. at 988. \n\n9 \n \ninjunction in favor of Planned Parenthood and the \nindividual plaintiffs.11 \nTexas appealed and, two years later, and again \nrelying on Gee, the Fifth Circuit affirmed that there \nwas a right of action.12 It also concluded, however, \nthat the district court had applied the incorrect \nstandard to determine whether Texas had violated \nthe individuals\u2019 rights when it terminated its \ncontracts with the abortion provider.13 So, it vacated \nthe injunction and remanded for further proceedings. \nTwo years after that, the Fifth Circuit granted \nTexas\u2019s petition for en banc review. One year later, in \n2020, the en banc Fifth Circuit overruled Gee. The \ncourt recognized that \n[w]hether \na \nparticular \nprovider \nis \n\u201cqualified\u201d \u201cwill obviously vary with the \ncircumstances of each individual case,\u201d \nand though courts are equipped to \ndetermine if a particular provider is \nqualified in the broad sense of that term, \njust as they are equipped to determine \nwhether a child protective agency made \n\u201creasonable efforts\u201d in a particular case, \nthe fact that the courts could make such \ndeterminations \nif \ncalled \nupon \nby \n \n11 Id. at 999. \n12 Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventative Health Servs., Inc v. Smith, 913 F.3d 551, 560 (5th \nCir. 2019). \n13 Id. at 569 (emphasis added). \n\n10 \n \nCongress is not dispositive. There must \nbe a grant of a right to beneficiaries.14 \nBecause Congress had not explicitly granted that \nright, \u201cthe Individual Plaintiffs d[id] not have a right \nto continued benefits to pay for care from the \nProviders\u201d15 and could not sue. The case was \ndismissed. \n \n*** \nIn the end, it took six years of litigation in two \nStates for the Fifth Circuit to finally\u2014correctly\u2014\ndetermine that Congress never created a right to sue \nin the first place.16 Fortunately, it has now done so, \nand in that circuit, there will be no right to sue unless \nCongress expressly says there is. This result holds \nCongress to its duty to make any terms and conditions \nclear and unambiguous and prohibits courts from \nreading into statutes implied rights that Congress did \nnot make explicit. This is the result the Constitution \nrequires. \nb. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s Litigation Carousel \nThe Fourth Circuit has taken things in the \nopposite direction. \nBy this time, the Court is well familiar with South \nCarolina\u2019s struggle over the same qualified provider \n \n14 Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 362 \n(5th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (footnote omitted, emphasis added). \n15 Id. at 357. \n16 The Eighth Circuit reached the same conclusion as the Fifth \nCircuit after two years of litigation. See Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034, 1046 (8th Cir. 2017). \n\n11 \n \nprovision. In 2018, South Carolina did what many \nother States have done: It determined that it was not \nin the interest of the State to continue funding \nabortion providers.17 As it had elsewhere, Planned \nParenthood gathered individual plaintiffs and sued. \nAs had the other States, South Carolina argued there \nwas no right to sue.18 \n \nIn round one of litigation (at the preliminary \ninjunction stage), the District of South Carolina relied \non the other circuits\u2019 holdings and Blessing to \ndetermine that there was a private right of action \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.19 The Fourth Circuit did the \nsame and affirmed. This Court denied certiorari.20 \nAt the merits stage, the district court declined to \nrevisit its earlier holding.21  So did the Fourth Circuit, \nsaying:  \nAfter \napplying \nthe \nthree \nfactors \narticulated by the Supreme Court in \nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 \n(1997), \nwe \n[] \nconcluded \n[at \nthe \npreliminary injunction stage] that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconferred on [plaintiff] a private right \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983. \n\u2026 \n \n17 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 326 F. Supp. 3d 39, 42 \n(D.S.C. 2018). \n18 Id. \n19 Id. at 44\u201347. \n20 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020). \n21 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 487 F. Supp. 3d 443, \n447 (D.S.C. 2020). \n\n12 \n \nIf these three factors are satisfied, there \nis \u201ca rebuttable presumption that the \nright is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d \nprovided that Congress has not expressly \nor implicitly foreclosed a \u00a7 1983 remedy. \nTo repeat, the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision states that \u201c[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must ... provide that \nany individual eligible for medical \nassistance ... may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution ... qualified to \nperform the service or services required.\u201d \nIt is difficult to imagine a clearer or more \naffirmative directive. The statute plainly \nreflects Congress\u2019s desire that individual \nMedicaid recipients be free to obtain care \nfrom any qualified provider and it \nimplements this policy in direct and \nunambiguous language. For this reason, \nall three of the Blessing factors are met.22 \nSo, the Fourth Circuit affirmed. This time, this \nCourt granted certiorari, vacated the decision, and \nordered the Fourth Circuit to reconsider in light of \nHealth and Hospital Corporation of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 143 S. Ct. 1444 (2023), a case that did not \napply the Blessing test but did not overrule it either.23 \nSix years after litigation began, the Fourth Circuit \nshrugged \noff \nthe \ndirective, \nstating: \n\u201cWe \nare \n \n22 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr, 27 F.4th 945, 950, 955 (4th \nCir. 2022) (some internal citations and quotation marks omitted; \nfirst alteration supplied) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)). \n23 Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023). \n\n13 \n \nunconvinced that Talevski effected such a clear \ndoctrinal \ntransformation\u201d \nas \nto \nrequire \nreconsideration.24  Because the Talevski Court \nappeared to apply Blessing, the Fourth Circuit \nconcluded the law had not changed, though \u201cTalevski \nshed some new light on Blessing that was theretofore \nunknown to us. Importantly, by declining to apply all \nthree factors, the Talevski Court indicated that no one \nof them is strictly mandatory for finding a private \nright had been created.\u201d25  It thus declined to disturb \nits previous decision and continued to hold that the \nqualified \nprovider \nprovision \nclearly \nand \nunambiguously imparts a private right of action. \n*** \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s view is untenable. The \nConstitution requires Congress to make the terms and \nconditions of Spending Clause statutes clear and \nunambiguous so that \u201cthe States [may] exercise their \nchoice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of \ntheir participation.\u201d26 By holding that not only there \nare multiple factors to consider in determining \nwhether there is a right to sue but also that some of \nthe old factors may not be relevant, the Fourth Circuit \nhas made it nigh impossible for States to predict when \na court will allow them to be sued for routine policy \ndecisions. \nIn contrast, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s much more modest \napproach correctly recognizes that even if a court \n \n24 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr, 95 F.4th 152, 160 (4th Cir. \n2024). \n25 Id. at 163 (emphasis added). \n26 Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 451 U.S. at 17. \n\n14 \n \ncould decide an issue generally, it must not do so if \nCongress did not warn the States ahead of time that \nthey can be sued. \nThis warning should be nothing less than an \nexplicit statement from Congress, one that is\u2014as the \nConstitution requires\u2014clear and unambiguous. It \nshould be something that can be recognized at once as \na grant of a right to sue. Something that does not \nrequire the States to guess as to how a court may come \nout in a multi-factor test. It should certainly not \nrequire the States to guess which factor(s) a court may \ndecide is/are relevant in any given case. \nII. \nThe Price of Spending Clause Statutes \nIn addition to the general harm of sewing \nconfusion, this judicial whiplash causes the States \nmonetary and sovereign harm. \na. The high costs to the States \nSection 1983 litigation is extremely expensive, \neven more so where, as here, whether there is a right \nto sue is not immediately clear.

In exchange, \nthe States agree to comply with the terms and \nconditions attached to those funds. Those conditions \nmust be clear and unambiguous when the funding is \naccepted. \nIf the States fail to comply with the conditions \nset by the statute, they can expect to lose the funding. \nHowever, in some cases, they are also open to lawsuits \nfrom private individuals under the relevant statute \nitself or under section 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Before an \nindividual can recover under \u00a7 1983, he must show \nCongress unambiguously created an individual right \nthat is enforceable under that section. \nThe lower courts have been inconsistent as to \nwhen a statute creates an unambiguous individual \nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Some courts apply a \nmulti-factor balancing test, requiring extensive \nlitigation just to determine if there is a right at all. \nOthers say that test no longer applies, but it is not \nclear what does apply in its absence. So, the States \nlack proper notice of whether they are at risk of private \n                                                     \n1 Counsel for the parties were given notice of Amici\u2019s \nintent to file an amicus brief in support of Petitioner \npursuant to Rule 37.2, but due to excusable neglect, \nnotice was not given 10 days in advance. \n\n2 \n \nsuit when they accept federal funding and are often \nsued when they did not expect to be. \nAmici States of Kansas, Alabama, Alaska, \nFlorida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Mississippi, \nMontana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, \nTennessee, Utah, and West Virginia are interested in \nclearing the confusion with an express statement from \nthis Court that Wright, Wilder, and Blessing, the cases \nthat created the multi-factor balancing test, are no \nlonger good law. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nWhen Congress makes funding available to the \nStates to carry out programs for the general welfare, it \noften attaches conditions to that funding. Those \nconditions must be clear and unambiguous when the \nfunding is accepted. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). \nIn some cases, Spending Clause statutes give \nrise to individual rights of action against the States \nthat are privately enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \nIn \nthree \ncases, \nWright \nv. \nCity \nof \nRoanoke \nRedevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418 \n(1987), Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, 496 \nU.S. 498 (1990), and Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. \n329, 346 (1997), this Court created a multi-part \nbalancing test to determine whether a federal \nSpending Clause statute creates such a right. \nArguably, that test was inconsistent with the \nrule that conditions attached to federal funding must \nbe clear and unambiguous at the time the funds are \naccepted. Recognizing this, in three later cases, \nGonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. \n320 (2015), and Health & Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), the \nCourt retreated from the test and impliedly\u2014but not \nexpressly\u2014overruled it. \nSince those decisions, much confusion has \narisen in the lower courts about how to determine \nwhether a State is liable to private parties if it does not \ncomply with Spending Clause conditions. This in turn \n\n4 \n \nhas put States in a bind; they are unable to determine \nwhen they accept federal funds whether they are \nopening themselves up to lawsuits, including the \naccompanying liability for damages and attorney\u2019s \nfees. \nThis case presents the appropriate vehicle for \nthe Court to declare that Wright, Wilder, and Blessing \nare no longer good law and to affirm that there is no \nprivate right of action in a Spending Clause statute \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983 unless Congress says so \nunambiguously. \nARGUMENT \nAmici States seek to provide the court a \ncomplete analysis on this issue that would assist it in \nunderstanding the history of the confusion and why \nthis court should grant the petition to resolve it. \nI. \nWright, Wilder, and Blessing and the \nBlessing Test \nWe begin with Wright. Wright started with a \nrent dispute between tenants and their city housing \nauthority, an entity established by the United States \nHousing Act of 1937 (the Housing Act) to provide \nhousing for low-income people. 479 U.S. at 419\u201320. \nThe 1969 Brook Amendment (Brook Amendment) to \nthe Housing Act provided that the tenants \u201c\u2018shall pay \nas rent\u2019 a specified percentage of [their] income.\u201d Id. at \n420. So, the housing authority charged the tenants a \npercentage of their income as rent. But it also charged \na \u201csurcharge\u201d for excess utility consumption. Id. at \n421. \n\n5 \n \nThe tenants sued, arguing that this violated \ntheir rights under the Brook Amendment because \ntheir total \u201crent\u201d payment exceeded the statutory cap. \nThough the Amendment did not define \u201crent\u201d to \ninclude utilities, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) had done so in its \nimplementing regulations. Id. at 421. \nThe Court was asked to decide whether the \nstatute, as interpreted by HUD, created a private right \nthat could be enforced against the housing authority \nunder \u00a7 1983. The Court began with its earlier holding \nin Maine v. Thiboutot, which held that federal statutes \nwere \u201claws\u201d that could give rise to a private right of \naction enforceable under \u00a7 1983. 448 U.S. 1, 3\u20134 \n(1980). Not all federal statutes provide such \nenforceable rights, however. There is no right of action \n\u201cwhere Congress has foreclosed such enforcement of \nthe statute in the enactment itself and where the \nstatute did not create enforceable rights, privileges, or \nimmunities within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.\u201d Wright, \n479 U.S. at 423 (citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. 1 & \nMiddlesex Cnty. Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea \nClammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1 (1981)). \nThe Court determined the Brook Amendment \ndid create a private right of action. In doing so, it \nconsidered the text of the statute, the legislative \nhistory, and HUD\u2019s interpretation of the statute \nthrough its implementing regulations. It found \nnothing to indicate that Congress intended to preclude \na person from suing in federal court under \u00a7 1983 if he \nwas overcharged in rent. Id. at 429. And \u201crent\u201d \nincluded the cost of utilities. \u201cHUD\u2019s view [that] \n\n6 \n \ntenants have the right to bring suit in federal court to \nchallenge housing authorities\u2019 calculations of utility \nallowances\u201d \u201cis entitled to some deference by this \nCourt.\u201d  Id. at 427 (citing Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984), \noverruled by Loper Bright Enter. v. Raimondo, No. 22-\n1219, 2024 WL 3208360, at *22 (U.S. June 28, 2024)). \nThe Court did not directly address whether this \ninterpretation of the statute was consistent with the \nSpending Clause.  \nFour Justices dissented. They also looked to the \nplain language of the statute and the legislative \nhistory and found no private right of action\u2014let alone \none that defined rent to include utilities. Wright, 479 \nU.S. at 437\u201338 (O\u2019Connor, J. dissenting). In their view, \na right found solely in HUD\u2019s interpretation of the \nBrook Amendment as expressed in its regulations did \nnot show Congress had intended to create the right. Id. \nat 435. The regulations alone did not give the tenants \na \u201cstatutory entitlement enforceable in federal courts \nby virtue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 780.  \nThree years later, the Court again considered \nthe question in Wilder. There, the Court was asked \nwhether the Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act \ngave healthcare providers a right to sue the States \nunder \u00a7 1983. Medicaid is a state and federal program. \nIn exchange for federal funds, Congress required the \nStates to submit to the Secretary for Health and \nHuman Services a plan that, among other things, \nestablished \u201ca scheme for reimbursing health care \nproviders for the medical services provided to needy \nindividuals.\u201d 496 U.S. at 502. In relevant part, the \n\n7 \n \nState plan must \u201cprovide . . . for payment . . . of the \nhospital services, nursing facility services, and \nservices in an intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded provided under the plan through \nthe use of rates (determined in accordance with \nmethods and standards developed by the State . . .) \nwhich the State finds, and makes assurances \nsatisfactory to the Secretary, are reasonable and \nadequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by \nefficiently and economically operated facilities . . .\u201d Id. \nat 502\u201303 (emphasis in original, final ellipsis added) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. \nV)). \nRelying on Wright, the Court found the Boren \nAmendment did create an enforceable right. It noted \nthe mandatory language of the statute (\u201cshall\u201d) and \nthe intended beneficiary (healthcare providers). Id. at \n510\u201311. It also found the States\u2019 obligation (to pay \nreasonable rates) was not so \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d \nas to be \u201cbeyond the competence of the judiciary to \nenforce.\u201d Id. at 512, 519\u201320. Beyond the text of the \nstatute, Court also considered the legislative history \nand determined that Congress had intended to create \nthe private right. Id. at 516\u2013517. Finally, the Court \nheld the right was enforceable in federal court under \n\u00a7 1983 because Congress had neither included an \nexpress provision to the contrary nor provided for a \nsufficiently comprehensive administrative scheme as \nto foreclose such as remedy. Id. at 520\u201321. Therefore, \nthe healthcare providers could sue the State for a \nviolation of the Boren Amendment under \u00a7 1983. \n\n8 \n \nOnce again, four Justices dissented. Chief \nJustice Rehnquist noted \u201cthe Court looks beyond the \nunambiguous terms of the statute and relies on policy \nconsiderations purportedly derived from legislative \nhistory and superseded versions of the statute,\u201d \nWilder, 496. at 527 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting), and \nthat \u201cthe Court\u2019s interpretation takes far more \nliberties with the statutory language than does the \nposition advanced by petitioners,\u201d id. at 528\u201329.  On \nits own terms, the dissent argued, the Boren \nAmendment did not create any privately enforceable \nright. \nSeven years later, the Court took the factors \nfrom Wright and Wilder and created the Blessing test. \nThis three-part test required courts to consider \n(1) whether Congress \u201cintended the provision at issue \nto benefit the plaintiff\u201d; (2) whether \u201cthe right \nassertedly protected by the statute is not so \u2018vague and \namorphous\u2019 that its enforcement would strain judicial \ncompetence\u201d; and (3) whether the statute was \n\u201ccouched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms\u201d \nsuch that it \u201cunambiguously imposed a binding \nobligation on the States.\u201d Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340\u201341 \n(citing Wright, 479 U.S. at 430 then Wilder, 496 at \n510\u2013511). If, applying these three factors, a plaintiff \nestablished that Congress intended to create an \nindividual \nright, \n\u201cthere \nis \nonly \na \nrebuttable \npresumption that the right is enforceable under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 341. The burden is then on the State \u201cto \nshow Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under \n\u00a7 1983. Congress may do so expressly, by forbidding \nrecourse to \u00a7 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by \n\n9 \n \ncreating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is \nincompatible with individual enforcement under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \n \nThough simple enough on its face, the Blessing \ntest proved difficult for the lower courts to apply.  \nMany applied the same test to the same statute and \nreached different conclusions. So, the Court sought to \nclarify the issue in Gonzaga, 536 U.S. 273. \nIn that case, the Court sought to resolve a \ncircuit split as to whether the non-disclosure provision \nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 \n(\u201cFERPA\u201d) gave rise to a private right of action that \nwas enforceable against the States under \u00a7 1983. Id. at \n278. The Court observed \u201cother state and federal \ncourts have divided on the question of FERPA\u2019s \nenforceability under \u00a7 1983. The fact that all of these \ncourts have relied on the same set of opinions from this \nCourt [including Wright, Wilder, and Blessing] \nsuggests that our opinions in this area may not be \nmodels of clarity.\u201d Id. \nIn the end, the Court held FERPA did not create \na right of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983. It clarified \nthat \u00a7  1983 \u201cprovides a remedy only for the \ndeprivation of \u2018rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United \nStates\u2019\u201d and \u201cnot the broader or vaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \n\u2018interests,\u2019 that may be enforced under the authority of \nthat section.\u201d Id. at 283 (emphasis added). And \u201cif \nII. \nRetreating from Wright, Wilder, and \nBlessing \n\n10 \n \nCongress wishes to create new rights enforceable \nunder \u00a7 1983, it must do so in clear and unambiguous \nterms\u2014no less and no more than what is required for \nCongress to create new rights enforceable under an \nimplied private right of action.\u201d Id. at 290. It held \nFERPA was not enforceable against the States by \nprivate parties for three major reasons. First, it did not \ncontain \u201crights-creating language,\u201d such as the word \n\u201cright.\u201d Id. at 290. Second, the provision had an \n\u201caggregate purpose\u201d and was not concerned with the \n\u201cneeds of any particular person.\u201d Id. at 288. And third, \nit did not directly impose a duty on schools regarding \ntheir students; rather, it was directed to the Secretary \nof Education. Id. at 290. \nIn reaching this result, the Court veered away \nfrom its prior cases in three key ways. First, the Court \nnoted that Wilder \u201cappear[ed] to support[] the notion\u201d \n\u201cthat our implied private right of action cases have no \nbearing on the standards for discerning whether a \nstatute creates rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983. Id. at 283. \nIt then affirmatively rejected that notion: \u201c[O]ur \nimplied right of action cases should guide the \ndetermination of whether a statute confers rights \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. This, as the dissent \nnoted, \u201crequire[s] a heightened showing from \u00a7 1983 \nplaintiffs,\u201d 36 U.S. at 300 (Stevens, J., dissenting), over \nand above what Wright, Wilder, and Blessing \nseemingly would have required. \nNext, the Court appeared to reject Wright and \nWilder\u2019s search for an implied right of action in the \nlegislative history of the statute or in the agency \nregulations implementing it. \u201c[W]here the text and \nstructure of a statute provide no indication that \nCongress intends to create new individual rights, there \n\n11 \n \nis no basis for a private suit, whether under \u00a7 1983 or \nunder an implied right of action.\u201d Id. at 286; see also \nid. at 285 n.5 (the dissent \u201cwould conclude that \nCongress intended FERPA\u2019s nondisclosure provisions \nto confer individual rights on millions of school \nstudents from kindergarten through graduate school \nwithout having ever said so explicitly. This conclusion \nentails a judicial assumption[] with no basis in \nstatutory text . . .\u201d). Thus, the Court seemed to \nconclude that only the plain language of the statute \ncould create a private right of action. \nFinally, and most importantly, the Court did not \napply the multifactor Blessing test. In fact, it appeared \nto reject it altogether. \u201c[W]e fail to see how relations \nbetween the branches are served by having courts \napply a multifactor balancing test to pick and choose \nwhich federal requirements may be enforced by \u00a7 1983 \nand which may not.\u201d Id. at 286. However, as the \ndissent noted then\u2014and lower courts note now\u2014it did \nnot expressly overrule Blessing. To the contrary, \nCourt\u2019s analysis involved some of the same reasoning \nas Blessing. Compare id. at 288 (focus of the statute \nshould be on the individual); with Blessing, 520 U.S. \nat 343 (State must owe services to a \u201cparticular \nperson). See also Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 302 (Stevens, \nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Court\u2019s analysis, in part, closely \ntracks Blessing\u2019s factors, as it examines the statute\u2019s \nlanguage, and the asserted right\u2019s individual versus \nsystematic thrust.\u201d). So, as noted, while the Gonzaga \nCourt moved away from Wright, Wilder, or Blessing, it \ndid not expressly overrule them.  \nThis implied rejection continued in two other \nrelevant cases. First, in Armstrong, the Court \ndiscussed Wilder and the Boren Amendment, but \n\n12 \n \nobserved in a footnote that the plaintiffs did \u201cnot assert \na \u00a7 1983 action, since our later opinions plainly \nrepudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action that \nWilder exemplified.\u201d 575 U.S. at 330 n.* (citing \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283). And most recently, in \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166, the Court cited Blessing just \nonce in determining that the Federal Nursing Home \nReform Act did create a right of action enforceable \nunder section 1983. It did not discuss Wright or Wilder \nat all. \nIII. \nWright, Wilder, Blessing, Gonzaga, \nand Armstrong in the lower courts \n \nToday, the lower courts are divided as to \nwhether Wilder, Wright, and Blessing remain good \nlaw. As Judge Richardson noted in an earlier version \nof this case, it is unclear (1) whether the multi-factor \nbalancing test applies, (2) whether the courts may rely \non implied-right-of-action cases to determine whether \na right is enforceable under section 1983, and (3) what \nevidence is relevant to that analysis. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 941 F.3d 687, 709 (4th Cir. \n2019) (Richardson, J., concurring). \nAt least one court has concluded on its own that \nWilder, at least, is no longer good law. Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034, 1045 (8th Cir. 2017) (\u201cArmstrong \nconfirmed that the 1990 Wilder decision has been \nrepudiated by post\u20131994 precedent.\u201d). Most other \ncourts, however, will not do so absent a statement from \nthis Court. As Judge Richardson explained, it is \nunclear whether this Court must expressly overrule its \nprecedent before lower courts may consider it \ndiscarded. Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr, 95 F.4th \n\n13 \n \n152, 170 n.2 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., \nconcurring). \nTo that end, some courts discuss the uncertainly \nas to Wilder, Wright, and Blessing are still good law, \nbut continue to apply them regardless. One court noted \nthat \u201crecent Supreme Court authority casts doubt \nupon the continued applicability of the Blessing factors \n. . . Still, the Supreme Court has not expressly held \nthat the Blessing factors are no longer relevant.\u201d Fed. \nL. Enf\u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Att\u2019y Gen. New Jersey, 93 \nF.4th 122, 130 (3d Cir. 2024) (internal citation \nomitted). Another court observed: \n[A]n earlier Supreme Court case, Wilder \nv. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. 498, \n522 (1990), had previously rejected \nKansas\u2019s \nargument \n[that \nthe \n\u201csole \nremedy Congress provided for a State\u2019s \nfailure \nto \ncomply \nwith \nMedicaid\u2019s \nrequirements is the withholding of \nMedicaid funds by the federal Secretary \nof Health and Human Services,\u201d not a \nprivate action under \u00a7 1983]. Wilder held \nthat the \u201cMedicaid Act\u2019s administrative \nscheme cannot be considered sufficiently \ncomprehensive \nto \ndemonstrate \na \ncongressional intent to withdraw the \nprivate remedy of \u00a7 1983. \u2018Generalized \npowers\u2019 to audit and cut off federal funds \nare insufficient to foreclose reliance on \n\u00a7 1983 to vindicate federal rights.\u201d 16 496 \nU.S. at 522 (quoting Wright, 479 U.S. at \n428). And because Justice Kennedy didn\u2019t \n\n14 \n \njoin Justice Scalia\u2019s Spending Clause \nreasoning [in Armstrong], it is not \nbinding on us; Wilder still is. \nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas v. Andersen, 882 F.3d \n1205, 1229 (10th Cir. 2018) (internal alterations \nomitted); see also id. at 1229 n.16 (\u201cEven if the \nSupreme \nCourt \nhad \n[overruled \nWright \nin \nArmstrong]\u2014and we do not think it did\u2014it would not \nimpact our analysis.\u201d); Sabree ex rel. Sabree v. \nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2004) (\u201cWhile in \nGonzaga University the Court rejected the notion that \nits cases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right to support a cause of action brought \nunder \u00a7 1983, it carefully avoided disturbing, much \nless \noverruling, \nWright \nand \nWilder.\u201d \n(internal \nalterations and quotation marks omitted)). \nBecause many courts still consider Wright, \nWilder, and Blessing to be binding, this discussion \noccurs more often in concurrences or dissents. For \nexample, in her dissent in York State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for \nChild. v. Poole, Judge Livingston said: \n \nThe Supreme Court has held that \nSpending Clause legislation created an \nindividually enforceable right under \n\u00a7 1983 in only three cases. The majority \ncites these cases repeatedly, but glosses \nover the nearly three decades of case law \nfollowing Wilder, the most recent of the \ntrio, during which time the Supreme \nCourt has never again recognized a \nprivate right enforceable under \u00a7 1983 in \nSpending Clause legislation. This trend \nhas not been accidental. As the Court\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In exchange, \nthe States agree to comply with the terms and \nconditions attached to those funds. Everyone agrees \nthat those terms and conditions must be clear and \nunambiguous when the States accept the money. \nIf the States fail to comply with the conditions set \nby the statute, they can expect to lose the funding. In \naddition, in some instances, they are also open to \nlawsuits from private individuals under the relevant \nstatute itself or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Before an individual \ncan sue and recover under \u00a7 1983, however, he must \nshow that Congress clearly and unambiguously \ncreated an individual right of action that is \nenforceable under that section. \nThe lower courts have been inconsistent as to \nwhen a Spending Clause statute creates a clear and \nunambiguous individual right enforceable under \n\u00a7 1983. Some courts apply a multi-factor test to \ndetermine whether the plain language of a statute \ngrants a right to sue. Others say that that test no \nlonger applies but continue to weigh various factors. \nAs a result, the States often lack proper notice of \nwhether they are at risk of private suit when they \naccept federal funding and are often sued when they \n \n1 Amici States certify that no counsel for a party authored this \nbrief in whole or in part and no person or entity, other than \namici, their members, or their counsel, has made a monetary \ncontribution to its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \ndid not expect to be. This is unconstitutional. And the \ncosts of this litigation are considerable. The States \nmust pay their own costs to litigate whether there is \na right to sue in the first place and, if the court decides \nthere is such a right, to defend themselves. And if they \nlose, they must also pay damages and the plaintiff\u2019s \nattorney\u2019s fees. \nAmici States of Kansas, Alabama, Alaska, \nArkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, \nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and West \nVirginia are interested in clearing the confusion once \nand for all. This Court should hold that nothing short \nof an explicit statement from Congress declaring that \na Spending Clause statute contains a private right of \naction enforceable against the States imparts such a \nright. Accordingly, the Court should reverse the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s decision. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nWhen Congress makes funding available to the \nStates to carry out programs for the general welfare, \nit often attaches terms and conditions to that funding. \nThose conditions must be clear and unambiguous \nwhen the States accept that funding.2 \nIn some cases, Spending Clause statutes may \ncontain, as a condition, an individual right of action \nagainst the States privately enforceable under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In three cases, Wright v. City of \n \n2 Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981). \n \n\n3 \n \nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 \nU.S. 418 (1987), Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), and Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), this Court created a \nmulti-part test to determine whether a federal \nSpending Clause statute creates such a right. \nThis \nmulti-factor \ntest \ninherently \nleads \nto \nuncertainty. That test is, therefore, inconsistent with \nthe rule that terms and conditions attached to federal \nfunding must be clear and unambiguous at the time \nthe funds are accepted. \nAccordingly, in the following decades, this Court \nattempted to tighten the rule in Gonzaga University \nv. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320 (2015), and Health & \nHospital Corporation of Marion County v. Talevski, \n599 U.S. 166 (2023). But the lower courts continue to \napply the multi-factor test. The only difference is that \nnow it is unclear which factors they will apply and \nhow much weight they will give them. \nThis is best evidenced by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision below. The Fourth Circuit applied the multi-\nfactor \nBlessing \ntest \nand \nheld \nthe \nstatute \nunambiguously created a right to sue the State. On \nremand from this Court, the Fourth Circuit decided \nthat some of the factors might no longer be relevant, \napplied just one of them, and came to the same result. \nBy contrast, the Fifth Circuit has looked at the exact \nsame statute and held there is no such right. The Fifth \nCircuit has decided that Congress must do its job, \nholding that the Legislative Branch must clearly say \n\n4 \n \nif there is a right to sue\u2014the constitutionally required \nresult. \nAnything other than an explicit statement from \nCongress that a Spending Clause statute confers a \nprivate right of action enforceable against the States \nunder \u00a7 1983 fails to put the States on notice about \nsuch liability. Because anything less than a clear and \nunambiguous \nstatement \nviolates \nthe \nSpending \nClause, the Court should reverse. \n \nARGUMENT \nThe States accept billions of dollars in federal \nMedicaid funding every year.3 Though they are given \nwide latitude to use those funds, there are some \nrequirements with which they must comply. The \nStates accept that if they do not comply with these \nrequirements, they may lose that the money. But, as \nit stands today, arguably imperfect compliance\u2014a \nresult of a policy decision\u2014may open the States up to \nlawsuits from anyone who arguably benefits from one \nof these programs and suffers as a result of that \ndecision. At the very least, the States must litigate \nwhether the aggrieved person has a right to sue in the \nfirst place. This can take years, if not decades. And if \na court, applying the old (possibly no longer good) \nmulti-factor test decides there is such a right, the \nStates must then continue litigating until it is \ndetermined whether the law has been violated. If they \n \n3  Rebecca Thiess, Kate Watkins & Justin Theal, Record \nFederal Grants to States Keep Federal Share of State Budgets \nHigh, Pew Research (Sept. 10, 2024), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/35ztr64f. \n\n5 \n \nlose, they are open to damages and attorney\u2019s fees. All \nof this is costly. \nI. \nTwenty \nYears \nof \nLitigation \nto \nDetermine Whether a Suit can be \nBrought at All \nWhen a private party sues a State alleging it \nviolated one of his rights under \u00a7 1983, he must show \nhe has a right to sue in the first place. Under existing \nprecedent, that is not a straightforward inquiry. \nThe statute at issue here exemplifies the problem \nperfectly. The statute states: \nA State plan for medical assistance must \nprovide that [] any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance (including drugs) \nmay obtain such assistance from any \ninstitution, \nagency, \ncommunity \npharmacy, \nor \nperson, \nqualified \nto \nperform the service or services required \n(including \nan \norganization \nwhich \nprovides such services, or arranges for \ntheir availability, on a prepayment \nbasis), who undertakes to provide him \nsuch services[.] \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) (the qualified provider \nprovision). Notably absent from the statute is any \nlanguage explicitly stating that if a State determines \na provider is not qualified, any person eligible for \nassistance has a right to sue the State. So, when \n\n6 \n \nseveral States4 determined that Planned Parenthood \nwas not a \u201cqualified provider\u201d and were subsequently \nsued, the first job of the courts was to determine \nwhether those plaintiffs had a right to sue in the first \nplace. \nA look at the litigation in the Fourth and Fifth \nCircuits shows the need for a determinative answer as \nto what counts as a \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunambiguous\u201d right \nto sue under this statute and all others. \na. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Long Road to Nowhere \n \nLouisiana \nIn July 2015, an organization released video \nfootage, taken surreptitiously, allegedly showing staff \nat a Planned Parenthood in Texas sifting through the \nbody parts of aborted children and negotiating the \nsale of those body parts. This footage sparked a \ncongressional investigation. \nLouisiana also launched an investigation into \nPlanned Parenthood facilities operating in the state \nand, one month later, the Louisiana Department of \nHealth and Hospitals decided to terminate its \nagreements with the abortion providers. As per state \nlaw, it gave the organization thirty days to appeal the \ndecision. \nPlanned Parenthood did not appeal through the \nadministrative process. Instead, it sued the State in \nfederal court. Planned Parenthood argued the \n \n4 Including Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, \nSouth Carolina, and Texas. \n\n7 \n \nqualified provider provision gave it, or the private \nindividuals who joined the suit, a right to sue the \nState under \u00a7 1983 to reverse the funding decision. \nTwo months later, the Middle District of Louisiana \nagreed, granting an injunction prohibiting the State \nfrom terminating its Medicaid agreements with \nPlanned Parenthood. \nLouisiana appealed. In late 2016, the Fifth Circuit \naffirmed. The unanimous panel began \u201cby joining \nevery other circuit to have addressed this issue to \nconclude that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) affords the Individual \nPlaintiffs a private right of action under \u00a7 1983.\u201d5 \nNine months after that opinion was filed, Judge Owen \nchanged her mind in light of this Court\u2019s decision in \nO\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 \n(1980).6 In her dissent in the superseding opinion, she \nargued that O\u2019Bannon determinatively answered the \nquestion of whether Medicaid patients could challenge \na State\u2019s determination of whether a provider is \n\u201cqualified\u201d under \u00a7 1396a(a)(23): they could not. \n\u201c[P]atients ha[ve] no substantive right to demand care \nfrom a provider that had been decertified, they ha[ve] \nno due process rights to participate in a hearing \nregarding certification or decertification of the \nprovider.\u201d7 \n \n5 Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 837 F.3d 477, \n489 (5th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Circuit had arrived at this \nconclusion in 2006 after two years of litigation. Harris v. \nOlszewski, 442 F.3d 456 (6th Cir. 2006). The Tenth Circuit \nfollowed in 2018. Planned Parenthood of Kan. v. Andersen, 882 \nF.3d 1205 (10th Cir. 2018). \n6 Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 862 F.3d 445, \n476 (5th Cir. 2017) (Owens, J., dissenting). \n7 Id. at 475 (Owens, J., dissenting). \n\n8 \n \nDespite Judge Owen\u2019s dissent and this Court\u2019s \nO\u2019Bannon decision, the Fifth Circuit denied en banc \nreview and this Court denied certiorari. For three \nyears, Gee bound Fifth Circuit States. \nTexas \nAlso in 2015, the Texas Office of the Inspector \nGeneral concluded that the same video footage \nshowed Planned Parenthood violating Texas law, \nincluding prohibitions on the sale of human body \nparts. Based on the unlawful conduct, the State \nconcluded that Planned Parenthood was not a \n\u201cqualified provider\u201d and was no longer eligible to \nparticipate in the State\u2019s Medicaid program. Texas \nterminated its agreements with Planned Parenthood.8 \nRather than challenge the termination though the \nState\u2019s administrative process\u2014which it had a right \nto do\u2014Planned Parenthood joined private individuals \nand sued the State under \u00a7 1983.9 Texas asked for \ndismissal, arguing the qualified provider provision \ndoes not clearly and unambiguously contain a private \nright of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Two years \nlater, the Western District of Texas rejected that \nargument.  Relying solely on Gee, it held that the \nindividual plaintiffs did have such a right to sue when \na provider was determined to no longer be \n\u201cqualified.\u201d10 It then proceeded to find that Texas had \nviolated that right and granted a preliminary \n \n8 See generally Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. \n& Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Smith, 236 F. Supp. 3d 974 \n(W.D. Tex. 2017). \n9 Id. at 977. \n10 Id. at 988. \n\n9 \n \ninjunction in favor of Planned Parenthood and the \nindividual plaintiffs.11 \nTexas appealed and, two years later, and again \nrelying on Gee, the Fifth Circuit affirmed that there \nwas a right of action.12 It also concluded, however, \nthat the district court had applied the incorrect \nstandard to determine whether Texas had violated \nthe individuals\u2019 rights when it terminated its \ncontracts with the abortion provider.13 So, it vacated \nthe injunction and remanded for further proceedings. \nTwo years after that, the Fifth Circuit granted \nTexas\u2019s petition for en banc review. One year later, in \n2020, the en banc Fifth Circuit overruled Gee. The \ncourt recognized that \n[w]hether \na \nparticular \nprovider \nis \n\u201cqualified\u201d \u201cwill obviously vary with the \ncircumstances of each individual case,\u201d \nand though courts are equipped to \ndetermine if a particular provider is \nqualified in the broad sense of that term, \njust as they are equipped to determine \nwhether a child protective agency made \n\u201creasonable efforts\u201d in a particular case, \nthe fact that the courts could make such \ndeterminations \nif \ncalled \nupon \nby \n \n11 Id. at 999. \n12 Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventative Health Servs., Inc v. Smith, 913 F.3d 551, 560 (5th \nCir. 2019). \n13 Id. at 569 (emphasis added). \n\n10 \n \nCongress is not dispositive. There must \nbe a grant of a right to beneficiaries.14 \nBecause Congress had not explicitly granted that \nright, \u201cthe Individual Plaintiffs d[id] not have a right \nto continued benefits to pay for care from the \nProviders\u201d15 and could not sue. The case was \ndismissed. \n \n*** \nIn the end, it took six years of litigation in two \nStates for the Fifth Circuit to finally\u2014correctly\u2014\ndetermine that Congress never created a right to sue \nin the first place.16 Fortunately, it has now done so, \nand in that circuit, there will be no right to sue unless \nCongress expressly says there is. This result holds \nCongress to its duty to make any terms and conditions \nclear and unambiguous and prohibits courts from \nreading into statutes implied rights that Congress did \nnot make explicit. This is the result the Constitution \nrequires. \nb. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s Litigation Carousel \nThe Fourth Circuit has taken things in the \nopposite direction. \nBy this time, the Court is well familiar with South \nCarolina\u2019s struggle over the same qualified provider \n \n14 Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 362 \n(5th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (footnote omitted, emphasis added). \n15 Id. at 357. \n16 The Eighth Circuit reached the same conclusion as the Fifth \nCircuit after two years of litigation. See Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034, 1046 (8th Cir. 2017). \n\n11 \n \nprovision. In 2018, South Carolina did what many \nother States have done: It determined that it was not \nin the interest of the State to continue funding \nabortion providers.17 As it had elsewhere, Planned \nParenthood gathered individual plaintiffs and sued. \nAs had the other States, South Carolina argued there \nwas no right to sue.18 \n \nIn round one of litigation (at the preliminary \ninjunction stage), the District of South Carolina relied \non the other circuits\u2019 holdings and Blessing to \ndetermine that there was a private right of action \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.19 The Fourth Circuit did the \nsame and affirmed. This Court denied certiorari.20 \nAt the merits stage, the district court declined to \nrevisit its earlier holding.21  So did the Fourth Circuit, \nsaying:  \nAfter \napplying \nthe \nthree \nfactors \narticulated by the Supreme Court in \nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 \n(1997), \nwe \n[] \nconcluded \n[at \nthe \npreliminary injunction stage] that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconferred on [plaintiff] a private right \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983. \n\u2026 \n \n17 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 326 F. Supp. 3d 39, 42 \n(D.S.C. 2018). \n18 Id. \n19 Id. at 44\u201347. \n20 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020). \n21 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 487 F. Supp. 3d 443, \n447 (D.S.C. 2020). \n\n12 \n \nIf these three factors are satisfied, there \nis \u201ca rebuttable presumption that the \nright is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d \nprovided that Congress has not expressly \nor implicitly foreclosed a \u00a7 1983 remedy. \nTo repeat, the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision states that \u201c[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must ... provide that \nany individual eligible for medical \nassistance ... may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution ... qualified to \nperform the service or services required.\u201d \nIt is difficult to imagine a clearer or more \naffirmative directive. The statute plainly \nreflects Congress\u2019s desire that individual \nMedicaid recipients be free to obtain care \nfrom any qualified provider and it \nimplements this policy in direct and \nunambiguous language. For this reason, \nall three of the Blessing factors are met.22 \nSo, the Fourth Circuit affirmed. This time, this \nCourt granted certiorari, vacated the decision, and \nordered the Fourth Circuit to reconsider in light of \nHealth and Hospital Corporation of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 143 S. Ct. 1444 (2023), a case that did not \napply the Blessing test but did not overrule it either.23 \nSix years after litigation began, the Fourth Circuit \nshrugged \noff \nthe \ndirective, \nstating: \n\u201cWe \nare \n \n22 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr, 27 F.4th 945, 950, 955 (4th \nCir. 2022) (some internal citations and quotation marks omitted; \nfirst alteration supplied) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)). \n23 Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023). \n\n13 \n \nunconvinced that Talevski effected such a clear \ndoctrinal \ntransformation\u201d \nas \nto \nrequire \nreconsideration.24  Because the Talevski Court \nappeared to apply Blessing, the Fourth Circuit \nconcluded the law had not changed, though \u201cTalevski \nshed some new light on Blessing that was theretofore \nunknown to us. Importantly, by declining to apply all \nthree factors, the Talevski Court indicated that no one \nof them is strictly mandatory for finding a private \nright had been created.\u201d25  It thus declined to disturb \nits previous decision and continued to hold that the \nqualified \nprovider \nprovision \nclearly \nand \nunambiguously imparts a private right of action. \n*** \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s view is untenable. The \nConstitution requires Congress to make the terms and \nconditions of Spending Clause statutes clear and \nunambiguous so that \u201cthe States [may] exercise their \nchoice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of \ntheir participation.\u201d26 By holding that not only there \nare multiple factors to consider in determining \nwhether there is a right to sue but also that some of \nthe old factors may not be relevant, the Fourth Circuit \nhas made it nigh impossible for States to predict when \na court will allow them to be sued for routine policy \ndecisions. \nIn contrast, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s much more modest \napproach correctly recognizes that even if a court \n \n24 Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr, 95 F.4th 152, 160 (4th Cir. \n2024). \n25 Id. at 163 (emphasis added). \n26 Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 451 U.S. at 17. \n\n14 \n \ncould decide an issue generally, it must not do so if \nCongress did not warn the States ahead of time that \nthey can be sued. \nThis warning should be nothing less than an \nexplicit statement from Congress, one that is\u2014as the \nConstitution requires\u2014clear and unambiguous. It \nshould be something that can be recognized at once as \na grant of a right to sue. Something that does not \nrequire the States to guess as to how a court may come \nout in a multi-factor test. It should certainly not \nrequire the States to guess which factor(s) a court may \ndecide is/are relevant in any given case. \nII. \nThe Price of Spending Clause Statutes \nIn addition to the general harm of sewing \nconfusion, this judicial whiplash causes the States \nmonetary and sovereign harm. \na. The high costs to the States \nSection 1983 litigation is extremely expensive, \neven more so where, as here, whether there is a right \nto sue is not immediately clear. Litigating these types \nof cases can cost the States hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, money their taxpayers sent to provide other \nservices. \nCould the States decrease the costs by waiving the \nwhite flag and agreeing to be sued?  Yes, to some \nextent.  But the States disqualify hundreds of \nproviders each year for a variety of reasons that have \nnothing to with whether the provider is performing \n\n15 \n \nabortions.27 The idea that Congress obliquely granted \nMedicaid recipients the right to sue each and every \ntime the State exercised its discretion in disqualifying \none of these providers is absurd. It is even more \nabsurd to suggest that the States knowingly agreed to \nbe sued in every such case. \nNor is this limited to the qualified provider \nprovision of the Medicaid statute. In an earlier version \nof this case, the States brought to the Court\u2019s \nattention a number of instances where lower courts \nhave found an implied right of action in tucked away \nin a Medicaid statute. See, e.g., Bryson v. Shumway, \n308 F.3d 79, 89 (1st Cir. 2002) (permitting \u00a7 1983 \naction \nenforcing \nthe \n\u201creasonable \npromptness\u201d \nprovision of the Medicaid Act, \u00a7 1396a(a)(8)); Sabree \nex rel. Sabree v. Richman, 367 F.3d 180, 192 (3d Cir. \n2004) (permitting private enforcement of Medicaid \nAct \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10),  1396d(a)(15) because \u201cthe \nCourt has refrained from overruling Wright and \nWilder\u201d); Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 356 (4th Cir. \n2007) \n(permitting \nprivate \nenforcement \nof \n\u00a7 1396a(a)(8) because the \u201cMedicaid Act does not \nexplicitly forbid recourse to \u00a7 1983\u201d); Cal. Ass\u2019n of \nRural Health Clinics v. Douglas, 738 F.3d 1007, 1011\u2013\n13 (9th Cir. 2013) (permitting a provider to sue to \n \n27 For example, Kansas has terminated providers for not \ncomplying with their contracts, for losing licenses, or for \nviolating other State regulations.

For example, in \n2010, New York State Citizens\u2019 Coalition for Children \nsued the State of New York over its alleged failure to \ndistribute foster care funding in accordance with the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (CWA).29 \nThe Second Circuit found the CWA\u2014a statute with \nsimilar language to the statute at issue here\u2014\ncontains a private right of action supporting the suit.30 \nIn their amicus brief to this Court in support of \ncertiorari and reversal, Connecticut outlined the costs \nit and other States would be forced to incur if the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s loose approximation of \u201cclear and \nunambiguous\u201d were adopted.31 That brief outlined the \npolicy decisions Connecticut had made regarding its \nfoster care program, the costs of those policy decisions, \nand informed the Court that these \u201cpolicy goals, both \nstate and federal, would be thwarted by individually-\ndriven litigation focused narrowly on enhancing \npayments to some foster families.\u201d32 The States \npointed out that \u201c[l]itigation has now spread across \nthe country on this issue. Four circuits have spoken \non the issue, with conflicting results; and confusion \n \n28Amicus Br. of Indiana, et al. at 5, Baker v. Planned \nParenthood of South Carolina, 143 S. Ct. 2633 (No. 21-1431). \n29 See generally N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Child. v. Poole, \n922 F.3d 69 (2d Cir. 2019). \n30 Id. at 76\u201385. \n31Amicus Br. of Connecticut, et al. at 10\u201313, Poole v. N.Y. State \nCitizens\u2019 Coalition for Children, 140 S.

Even if multi-factor tests and implied rights \nof action were consistent with the Spending Clause\u2014\nthey are not\u2014lower courts are utterly incapable of \napplying them consistently and predictably. The time \nhas come for this Court\u2019s attention and resolution by \nclarifying that, absent an explicit, clear, and \nunambiguous statement from Congress that a \nSpending Clause statute contains an individual right \nof action, there is no such right. \nb. The costs to Medicaid recipients \n \nIn addition to monetary costs, there are costs to the \nvery people the Medicaid program was intended to \nsupport. If the States are afraid to disqualify a \nprovider because they have to guess as to whether any \ngiven court will preform a multi-factor test and decide \nthat the provider has a right to sue the State for \ndisqualifying it, the States will be crippled in their \nability to determine who is\u2014and more importantly, \nwho is not\u2014qualified to provide health services. This \nwill leave hundreds of unqualified providers with \nopportunities to prey on the poor. This serves no one\u2019s \ninterest, and it is preposterous to think the States \nobliquely agreed to this state of affairs. \n \n \n33 Id. at 15. \n34 Poole v. N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Child., 140 S. Ct. 956 \n(2020). \n\n18 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor over twenty years, courts have struggled to \ndecide whether this single provision clearly and \nunambiguously confers a right to sue the States under \n\u00a7 1983. As the courts have vacillated, the States have \nsuffered the consequences, paying unnecessary \nlitigation fees just to determine if there can be a suit \nin the first place. \nIt is past time to end the confusion. When Congress \nattaches terms and conditions to Spending Clause \nfunding, it must do so unambiguously or else, the \nStates cannot be said to have knowingly accepted \nthose terms. Congress knows how to explicitly say \nthat an individual can sue a State under any given \nstatute. This Court can and should hold it to that \nstandard. Anything less than such a clear statement \nis unfair to States and violates the Spending Clause.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision exacerbates the \nconfusion. The Court should reverse. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKRIS W. KOBACH \nAttorney General \n \n/s/ Anthony J. Powell \nANTHONY J. POWELL \nSolicitor General \nERIN B.

In exchange, \nthe States agree to comply with the terms and \nconditions attached to those funds. Those conditions \nmust be clear and unambiguous when the funding is \naccepted. \nIf the States fail to comply with the conditions \nset by the statute, they can expect to lose the funding. \nHowever, in some cases, they are also open to lawsuits \nfrom private individuals under the relevant statute \nitself or under section 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Before an \nindividual can recover under \u00a7 1983, he must show \nCongress unambiguously created an individual right \nthat is enforceable under that section. \nThe lower courts have been inconsistent as to \nwhen a statute creates an unambiguous individual \nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Some courts apply a \nmulti-factor balancing test, requiring extensive \nlitigation just to determine if there is a right at all. \nOthers say that test no longer applies, but it is not \nclear what does apply in its absence. So, the States \nlack proper notice of whether they are at risk of private \n                                                     \n1 Counsel for the parties were given notice of Amici\u2019s \nintent to file an amicus brief in support of Petitioner \npursuant to Rule 37.2, but due to excusable neglect, \nnotice was not given 10 days in advance. \n\n2 \n \nsuit when they accept federal funding and are often \nsued when they did not expect to be. \nAmici States of Kansas, Alabama, Alaska, \nFlorida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Mississippi, \nMontana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, \nTennessee, Utah, and West Virginia are interested in \nclearing the confusion with an express statement from \nthis Court that Wright, Wilder, and Blessing, the cases \nthat created the multi-factor balancing test, are no \nlonger good law. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nWhen Congress makes funding available to the \nStates to carry out programs for the general welfare, it \noften attaches conditions to that funding. Those \nconditions must be clear and unambiguous when the \nfunding is accepted. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). \nIn some cases, Spending Clause statutes give \nrise to individual rights of action against the States \nthat are privately enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \nIn \nthree \ncases, \nWright \nv. \nCity \nof \nRoanoke \nRedevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418 \n(1987), Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, 496 \nU.S. 498 (1990), and Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. \n329, 346 (1997), this Court created a multi-part \nbalancing test to determine whether a federal \nSpending Clause statute creates such a right. \nArguably, that test was inconsistent with the \nrule that conditions attached to federal funding must \nbe clear and unambiguous at the time the funds are \naccepted. Recognizing this, in three later cases, \nGonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. \n320 (2015), and Health & Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), the \nCourt retreated from the test and impliedly\u2014but not \nexpressly\u2014overruled it. \nSince those decisions, much confusion has \narisen in the lower courts about how to determine \nwhether a State is liable to private parties if it does not \ncomply with Spending Clause conditions. This in turn \n\n4 \n \nhas put States in a bind; they are unable to determine \nwhen they accept federal funds whether they are \nopening themselves up to lawsuits, including the \naccompanying liability for damages and attorney\u2019s \nfees. \nThis case presents the appropriate vehicle for \nthe Court to declare that Wright, Wilder, and Blessing \nare no longer good law and to affirm that there is no \nprivate right of action in a Spending Clause statute \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983 unless Congress says so \nunambiguously. \nARGUMENT \nAmici States seek to provide the court a \ncomplete analysis on this issue that would assist it in \nunderstanding the history of the confusion and why \nthis court should grant the petition to resolve it. \nI. \nWright, Wilder, and Blessing and the \nBlessing Test \nWe begin with Wright. Wright started with a \nrent dispute between tenants and their city housing \nauthority, an entity established by the United States \nHousing Act of 1937 (the Housing Act) to provide \nhousing for low-income people. 479 U.S. at 419\u201320. \nThe 1969 Brook Amendment (Brook Amendment) to \nthe Housing Act provided that the tenants \u201c\u2018shall pay \nas rent\u2019 a specified percentage of [their] income.\u201d Id. at \n420. So, the housing authority charged the tenants a \npercentage of their income as rent. But it also charged \na \u201csurcharge\u201d for excess utility consumption. Id. at \n421. \n\n5 \n \nThe tenants sued, arguing that this violated \ntheir rights under the Brook Amendment because \ntheir total \u201crent\u201d payment exceeded the statutory cap. \nThough the Amendment did not define \u201crent\u201d to \ninclude utilities, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) had done so in its \nimplementing regulations. Id. at 421. \nThe Court was asked to decide whether the \nstatute, as interpreted by HUD, created a private right \nthat could be enforced against the housing authority \nunder \u00a7 1983. The Court began with its earlier holding \nin Maine v. Thiboutot, which held that federal statutes \nwere \u201claws\u201d that could give rise to a private right of \naction enforceable under \u00a7 1983. 448 U.S. 1, 3\u20134 \n(1980). Not all federal statutes provide such \nenforceable rights, however. There is no right of action \n\u201cwhere Congress has foreclosed such enforcement of \nthe statute in the enactment itself and where the \nstatute did not create enforceable rights, privileges, or \nimmunities within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.\u201d Wright, \n479 U.S. at 423 (citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. 1 & \nMiddlesex Cnty. Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea \nClammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1 (1981)). \nThe Court determined the Brook Amendment \ndid create a private right of action. In doing so, it \nconsidered the text of the statute, the legislative \nhistory, and HUD\u2019s interpretation of the statute \nthrough its implementing regulations. It found \nnothing to indicate that Congress intended to preclude \na person from suing in federal court under \u00a7 1983 if he \nwas overcharged in rent. Id. at 429. And \u201crent\u201d \nincluded the cost of utilities. \u201cHUD\u2019s view [that] \n\n6 \n \ntenants have the right to bring suit in federal court to \nchallenge housing authorities\u2019 calculations of utility \nallowances\u201d \u201cis entitled to some deference by this \nCourt.\u201d  Id. at 427 (citing Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984), \noverruled by Loper Bright Enter. v. Raimondo, No. 22-\n1219, 2024 WL 3208360, at *22 (U.S. June 28, 2024)). \nThe Court did not directly address whether this \ninterpretation of the statute was consistent with the \nSpending Clause.  \nFour Justices dissented. They also looked to the \nplain language of the statute and the legislative \nhistory and found no private right of action\u2014let alone \none that defined rent to include utilities. Wright, 479 \nU.S. at 437\u201338 (O\u2019Connor, J. dissenting). In their view, \na right found solely in HUD\u2019s interpretation of the \nBrook Amendment as expressed in its regulations did \nnot show Congress had intended to create the right. Id. \nat 435. The regulations alone did not give the tenants \na \u201cstatutory entitlement enforceable in federal courts \nby virtue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 780.  \nThree years later, the Court again considered \nthe question in Wilder. There, the Court was asked \nwhether the Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act \ngave healthcare providers a right to sue the States \nunder \u00a7 1983. Medicaid is a state and federal program. \nIn exchange for federal funds, Congress required the \nStates to submit to the Secretary for Health and \nHuman Services a plan that, among other things, \nestablished \u201ca scheme for reimbursing health care \nproviders for the medical services provided to needy \nindividuals.\u201d 496 U.S. at 502. In relevant part, the \n\n7 \n \nState plan must \u201cprovide . . . for payment . . . of the \nhospital services, nursing facility services, and \nservices in an intermediate care facility for the \nmentally retarded provided under the plan through \nthe use of rates (determined in accordance with \nmethods and standards developed by the State . . .) \nwhich the State finds, and makes assurances \nsatisfactory to the Secretary, are reasonable and \nadequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by \nefficiently and economically operated facilities . . .\u201d Id. \nat 502\u201303 (emphasis in original, final ellipsis added) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982 ed., Supp. \nV)). \nRelying on Wright, the Court found the Boren \nAmendment did create an enforceable right. It noted \nthe mandatory language of the statute (\u201cshall\u201d) and \nthe intended beneficiary (healthcare providers). Id. at \n510\u201311. It also found the States\u2019 obligation (to pay \nreasonable rates) was not so \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d \nas to be \u201cbeyond the competence of the judiciary to \nenforce.\u201d Id. at 512, 519\u201320. Beyond the text of the \nstatute, Court also considered the legislative history \nand determined that Congress had intended to create \nthe private right. Id. at 516\u2013517. Finally, the Court \nheld the right was enforceable in federal court under \n\u00a7 1983 because Congress had neither included an \nexpress provision to the contrary nor provided for a \nsufficiently comprehensive administrative scheme as \nto foreclose such as remedy. Id. at 520\u201321. Therefore, \nthe healthcare providers could sue the State for a \nviolation of the Boren Amendment under \u00a7 1983. \n\n8 \n \nOnce again, four Justices dissented. Chief \nJustice Rehnquist noted \u201cthe Court looks beyond the \nunambiguous terms of the statute and relies on policy \nconsiderations purportedly derived from legislative \nhistory and superseded versions of the statute,\u201d \nWilder, 496. at 527 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting), and \nthat \u201cthe Court\u2019s interpretation takes far more \nliberties with the statutory language than does the \nposition advanced by petitioners,\u201d id. at 528\u201329.  On \nits own terms, the dissent argued, the Boren \nAmendment did not create any privately enforceable \nright. \nSeven years later, the Court took the factors \nfrom Wright and Wilder and created the Blessing test. \nThis three-part test required courts to consider \n(1) whether Congress \u201cintended the provision at issue \nto benefit the plaintiff\u201d; (2) whether \u201cthe right \nassertedly protected by the statute is not so \u2018vague and \namorphous\u2019 that its enforcement would strain judicial \ncompetence\u201d; and (3) whether the statute was \n\u201ccouched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms\u201d \nsuch that it \u201cunambiguously imposed a binding \nobligation on the States.\u201d Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340\u201341 \n(citing Wright, 479 U.S. at 430 then Wilder, 496 at \n510\u2013511). If, applying these three factors, a plaintiff \nestablished that Congress intended to create an \nindividual \nright, \n\u201cthere \nis \nonly \na \nrebuttable \npresumption that the right is enforceable under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 341. The burden is then on the State \u201cto \nshow Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under \n\u00a7 1983. Congress may do so expressly, by forbidding \nrecourse to \u00a7 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by \n\n9 \n \ncreating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is \nincompatible with individual enforcement under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \n \nThough simple enough on its face, the Blessing \ntest proved difficult for the lower courts to apply.  \nMany applied the same test to the same statute and \nreached different conclusions. So, the Court sought to \nclarify the issue in Gonzaga, 536 U.S. 273. \nIn that case, the Court sought to resolve a \ncircuit split as to whether the non-disclosure provision \nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 \n(\u201cFERPA\u201d) gave rise to a private right of action that \nwas enforceable against the States under \u00a7 1983. Id. at \n278. The Court observed \u201cother state and federal \ncourts have divided on the question of FERPA\u2019s \nenforceability under \u00a7 1983. The fact that all of these \ncourts have relied on the same set of opinions from this \nCourt [including Wright, Wilder, and Blessing] \nsuggests that our opinions in this area may not be \nmodels of clarity.\u201d Id. \nIn the end, the Court held FERPA did not create \na right of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983. It clarified \nthat \u00a7  1983 \u201cprovides a remedy only for the \ndeprivation of \u2018rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United \nStates\u2019\u201d and \u201cnot the broader or vaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \n\u2018interests,\u2019 that may be enforced under the authority of \nthat section.\u201d Id. at 283 (emphasis added). And \u201cif \nII. \nRetreating from Wright, Wilder, and \nBlessing \n\n10 \n \nCongress wishes to create new rights enforceable \nunder \u00a7 1983, it must do so in clear and unambiguous \nterms\u2014no less and no more than what is required for \nCongress to create new rights enforceable under an \nimplied private right of action.\u201d Id. at 290. It held \nFERPA was not enforceable against the States by \nprivate parties for three major reasons. First, it did not \ncontain \u201crights-creating language,\u201d such as the word \n\u201cright.\u201d Id. at 290. Second, the provision had an \n\u201caggregate purpose\u201d and was not concerned with the \n\u201cneeds of any particular person.\u201d Id. at 288. And third, \nit did not directly impose a duty on schools regarding \ntheir students; rather, it was directed to the Secretary \nof Education. Id. at 290. \nIn reaching this result, the Court veered away \nfrom its prior cases in three key ways. First, the Court \nnoted that Wilder \u201cappear[ed] to support[] the notion\u201d \n\u201cthat our implied private right of action cases have no \nbearing on the standards for discerning whether a \nstatute creates rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983. Id. at 283. \nIt then affirmatively rejected that notion: \u201c[O]ur \nimplied right of action cases should guide the \ndetermination of whether a statute confers rights \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. This, as the dissent \nnoted, \u201crequire[s] a heightened showing from \u00a7 1983 \nplaintiffs,\u201d 36 U.S. at 300 (Stevens, J., dissenting), over \nand above what Wright, Wilder, and Blessing \nseemingly would have required. \nNext, the Court appeared to reject Wright and \nWilder\u2019s search for an implied right of action in the \nlegislative history of the statute or in the agency \nregulations implementing it. \u201c[W]here the text and \nstructure of a statute provide no indication that \nCongress intends to create new individual rights, there \n\n11 \n \nis no basis for a private suit, whether under \u00a7 1983 or \nunder an implied right of action.\u201d Id. at 286; see also \nid. at 285 n.5 (the dissent \u201cwould conclude that \nCongress intended FERPA\u2019s nondisclosure provisions \nto confer individual rights on millions of school \nstudents from kindergarten through graduate school \nwithout having ever said so explicitly. This conclusion \nentails a judicial assumption[] with no basis in \nstatutory text . . .\u201d). Thus, the Court seemed to \nconclude that only the plain language of the statute \ncould create a private right of action. \nFinally, and most importantly, the Court did not \napply the multifactor Blessing test. In fact, it appeared \nto reject it altogether. \u201c[W]e fail to see how relations \nbetween the branches are served by having courts \napply a multifactor balancing test to pick and choose \nwhich federal requirements may be enforced by \u00a7 1983 \nand which may not.\u201d Id. at 286. However, as the \ndissent noted then\u2014and lower courts note now\u2014it did \nnot expressly overrule Blessing. To the contrary, \nCourt\u2019s analysis involved some of the same reasoning \nas Blessing. Compare id. at 288 (focus of the statute \nshould be on the individual); with Blessing, 520 U.S. \nat 343 (State must owe services to a \u201cparticular \nperson). See also Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 302 (Stevens, \nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Court\u2019s analysis, in part, closely \ntracks Blessing\u2019s factors, as it examines the statute\u2019s \nlanguage, and the asserted right\u2019s individual versus \nsystematic thrust.\u201d). So, as noted, while the Gonzaga \nCourt moved away from Wright, Wilder, or Blessing, it \ndid not expressly overrule them.  \nThis implied rejection continued in two other \nrelevant cases. First, in Armstrong, the Court \ndiscussed Wilder and the Boren Amendment, but \n\n12 \n \nobserved in a footnote that the plaintiffs did \u201cnot assert \na \u00a7 1983 action, since our later opinions plainly \nrepudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action that \nWilder exemplified.\u201d 575 U.S. at 330 n.* (citing \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283). And most recently, in \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166, the Court cited Blessing just \nonce in determining that the Federal Nursing Home \nReform Act did create a right of action enforceable \nunder section 1983. It did not discuss Wright or Wilder \nat all. \nIII. \nWright, Wilder, Blessing, Gonzaga, \nand Armstrong in the lower courts \n \nToday, the lower courts are divided as to \nwhether Wilder, Wright, and Blessing remain good \nlaw. As Judge Richardson noted in an earlier version \nof this case, it is unclear (1) whether the multi-factor \nbalancing test applies, (2) whether the courts may rely \non implied-right-of-action cases to determine whether \na right is enforceable under section 1983, and (3) what \nevidence is relevant to that analysis. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 941 F.3d 687, 709 (4th Cir. \n2019) (Richardson, J., concurring). \nAt least one court has concluded on its own that \nWilder, at least, is no longer good law. Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034, 1045 (8th Cir. 2017) (\u201cArmstrong \nconfirmed that the 1990 Wilder decision has been \nrepudiated by post\u20131994 precedent.\u201d). Most other \ncourts, however, will not do so absent a statement from \nthis Court. As Judge Richardson explained, it is \nunclear whether this Court must expressly overrule its \nprecedent before lower courts may consider it \ndiscarded. Planned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr, 95 F.4th \n\n13 \n \n152, 170 n.2 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., \nconcurring). \nTo that end, some courts discuss the uncertainly \nas to Wilder, Wright, and Blessing are still good law, \nbut continue to apply them regardless. One court noted \nthat \u201crecent Supreme Court authority casts doubt \nupon the continued applicability of the Blessing factors \n. . . Still, the Supreme Court has not expressly held \nthat the Blessing factors are no longer relevant.\u201d Fed. \nL. Enf\u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Att\u2019y Gen. New Jersey, 93 \nF.4th 122, 130 (3d Cir. 2024) (internal citation \nomitted). Another court observed: \n[A]n earlier Supreme Court case, Wilder \nv. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. 498, \n522 (1990), had previously rejected \nKansas\u2019s \nargument \n[that \nthe \n\u201csole \nremedy Congress provided for a State\u2019s \nfailure \nto \ncomply \nwith \nMedicaid\u2019s \nrequirements is the withholding of \nMedicaid funds by the federal Secretary \nof Health and Human Services,\u201d not a \nprivate action under \u00a7 1983]. Wilder held \nthat the \u201cMedicaid Act\u2019s administrative \nscheme cannot be considered sufficiently \ncomprehensive \nto \ndemonstrate \na \ncongressional intent to withdraw the \nprivate remedy of \u00a7 1983. \u2018Generalized \npowers\u2019 to audit and cut off federal funds \nare insufficient to foreclose reliance on \n\u00a7 1983 to vindicate federal rights.\u201d 16 496 \nU.S. at 522 (quoting Wright, 479 U.S. at \n428). And because Justice Kennedy didn\u2019t \n\n14 \n \njoin Justice Scalia\u2019s Spending Clause \nreasoning [in Armstrong], it is not \nbinding on us; Wilder still is. \nPlanned Parenthood of Kansas v. Andersen, 882 F.3d \n1205, 1229 (10th Cir. 2018) (internal alterations \nomitted); see also id. at 1229 n.16 (\u201cEven if the \nSupreme \nCourt \nhad \n[overruled \nWright \nin \nArmstrong]\u2014and we do not think it did\u2014it would not \nimpact our analysis.\u201d); Sabree ex rel. Sabree v. \nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2004) (\u201cWhile in \nGonzaga University the Court rejected the notion that \nits cases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right to support a cause of action brought \nunder \u00a7 1983, it carefully avoided disturbing, much \nless \noverruling, \nWright \nand \nWilder.\u201d \n(internal \nalterations and quotation marks omitted)). \nBecause many courts still consider Wright, \nWilder, and Blessing to be binding, this discussion \noccurs more often in concurrences or dissents. For \nexample, in her dissent in York State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for \nChild. v. Poole, Judge Livingston said: \n \nThe Supreme Court has held that \nSpending Clause legislation created an \nindividually enforceable right under \n\u00a7 1983 in only three cases. The majority \ncites these cases repeatedly, but glosses \nover the nearly three decades of case law \nfollowing Wilder, the most recent of the \ntrio, during which time the Supreme \nCourt has never again recognized a \nprivate right enforceable under \u00a7 1983 in \nSpending Clause legislation. This trend \nhas not been accidental. As the Court \n\n15 \n \nclarified in 2015, \u201cour later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of \na \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder exemplified.\u201d \nThe \nmajority \ncriticizes \ncitation \nto \nArmstrong as glomming on to one \nsentence of dicta, but the Court\u2019s \nmigration away from recognizing \u00a7 1983 \nrights is both pervasive and undeniable. \nIndeed, this Court has already conceded \nas much. \n922 F.3d 69, 90 (2d Cir. 2019) (Livingston, J., \ndissenting) (internal quotation marks, citations, and \nbrackets omitted) (citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 44, \n101 S. Ct. 1531).  So, she thought, if the States had \nagreed to mandatory spending provisions that opened \nthem up to private suit in federal court, \u201cthey did so \nunwittingly.\u201d Id. In Saint Anthony Hospital v. \nWhitehorn, Judge Brennen observed \u201cWright and \nWilder predate Gonzaga\u2019s requirement that a statute \nmust contain explicit \u2018rights-creating\u2019 language to \nunambiguously confer a private cause of action under \n\u00a7 1983. The two cases also predate the Court\u2019s \n\u2018rejection of\u2019 attempts to infer enforceable rights from \nSpending Clause statutes.\u201d 100 F.4th 767, 800 (7th Cir. \n2024) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (internal brackets and \ncitation omitted) (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 \nU.S. 273, 281, 284 (2002)). See also Midwest Foster \nCare & Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, 1202 \nn.8 (8th Cir. 2013) (\u201cThe dissent goes to great lengths \nto point out that Wilder remains good law. We agree of \ncourse, but we find Wilder to be distinguishable.\u201d \n(internal citation omitted)). \nFinally, in some cases, the courts treat Wilder, \nWright, and Blessing as good law. Some simply do not \n\n16 \n \naddress the tension those cases have with Gonzaga. \nSee, e.g., Anderson v. Ghaly, 930 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th \nCir. 2019); Burban v. City of Neptune Beach, Fla., 920 \nF.3d 1274, 1279 (11th Cir. 2019); Est. of Place v. \nAnderson, 398 F. Supp. 3d 816, 841 (D. Colo. 2019), \naff\u2019d sub nom. Est. of Angel Place v. Anderson, No. 19-\n1269, 2022 WL 1467645 (10th Cir. May 10, 2022). \nOthers compare the plain language of the statues they \nare asked to interprete to the statutes in Wilder and \nWright\u2014without noting that the Court in those cases \nlocated the rights in the implementing regulations and \nlegislative histories rather than the plain language of \nthe statutes. See, e.g., Poole, 922 F.3d at 82 (\u201cThis case \nis [] much closer to Wilder and Wright, where the \nSupreme Court found an enforceable right, than it is \nto Gonzaga and Blessing, where it did not.\u201d); Garnett \nv. Zeilinger, 323 F. Supp. 3d 58, 72 (D.D.C. 2018) (\u201cThe \nstatutory text at issue here strongly resembles those \nat issue in Wilder and Wright.\u201d). \nIV. \nKerr v. Planned Parenthood \nThe lower courts\u2019 confusion can best be summed \nup by the case at bar. In 2019 (at the preliminary \ninjunction stage), the Fourth Circuit applied the \nmultifactor Blessing test and found Medicaid\u2019s \nqualified-provider provision creates a private right of \naction enforceable against the State under \u00a7 1983. \nPlanned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Baker, 941 F.3d 687, 697, \n706 (4th Cir. 2019); see also Baker, 941 at 710 \n(Richardson, J., concurring) (\u201cToday, our opinion is \nguided by the three factors from Blessing.\u201d (internal \nbrackets and quotation marks omitted)). In so \ndeciding, the Fourth Circuit joined five other circuits \nthat reached the same result. See Planned Parenthood \nof Kansas v. Andersen, 882 F.3d 1205 (10th Cir. 2018); \n\n17 \n \nPlanned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 862 F.3d \n445 (5th Cir. 2017), overruled by Planned Parenthood \nof Greater Texas Fam. Plan. & Preventative Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347 (5th Cir. 2020); \nPlanned Parenthood Arizona Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d \n960 (9th Cir. 2013); Planned Parenthood of Indiana, \nInc. v. Comm\u2019r of Indiana State Dep\u2019t Health, 699 F.3d \n962 (7th Cir. 2012); Harris v. Olszewski, 442 F.3d 456 \n(6th Cir. 2006). At the time, only the Eighth Circuit \nhad reached the opposite conclusion. See Does v. \nGillespie, 867 F.3d 1034, 1046 (8th Cir. 2017). The \nState appealed, and this Court denied certiorari. \nBaker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 \n(2020). \nJudge Richardson concurred, but he questioned \nwhether \u201cWilder, specifically, and the Blessing factors, \ngenerally, [are] still good law?\u201d Baker, 941 F.3d at 709 \n(Richardson, J., concurring). Without an answer to \nthat question, \u201cthe proper framework for determining \nwhether a given statute creates a right that is \nprivately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d was uncertain. Id. \nat 708. However, \u201c[d]espite the \u2018confusion\u2019 and \n\u2018uncertainty,\u2019\u201d Judge Richardson concluded \u201cwe must \napply the law as we find it.\u201d Id. at 710. \nA year later, the en banc Fifth Circuit \nreconsidered its opinion in Gee and overruled it in \nKauffman. The Fifth Circuit held that Gonzaga and \nArmstrong \u201cplainly repudiate the ready implication of \na \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder exemplified.\u201d Kauffman, \n981 F.3d at 359. \nMedicaid\u2019s qualified-provider \nprovision did not create a private right of action \nbecause Congress did not \u201cunambiguously say that a \nbeneficiary may contest or otherwise challenge a \ndetermination that the provider of her choice is \n\n18 \n \nunqualified.\u201d Id. This decision created a 5-2 circuit \nsplit over whether the qualified-provider provision \ncreates a right of action privately enforceable under \n\u00a7 1983. \nIn 2022 (at the merits stage), the Fourth Circuit \nreached the same conclusion it had before. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr (Kerr I), 27 F.4th 945 (4th \nCir. 2022), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 143 S. Ct. \n2633 (2023). Once again, Judge Richardson noted in \nhis concurrence that \u201cthe caselaw on implied private \nrights of action remains plagued by confusion and \nuncertainty.\u201d Kerr I, 27 F.4th at 959 (Richardson, J., \nconcurring). This time, when the State appealed, this \nCourt granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and \nreversed so the Fourth Circuit could consider the \nquestion in light of Talevski. Kerr v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 143 S. Ct. 2633 (Mem) (2023). \nThis year, even with the benefit of Talevski, the \nFourth Circuit has reached the exact same conclusion \nit \ndid \nwhen \nit \nfirst \napplied \nthe\u2014potentially \ninapplicable\u2014Blessing \nbalancing \ntest. \nPlanned \nParenthood S. Atl. v. Kerr (Kerr II), 95 F.4th 152 (4th \nCir. 2024). Once again, Judge Richardson asked this \nCourt \u201cfor clarity on the precedential status of \n[Wilder]\u2014and, to a lesser extent, [Blessing].\u201d Kerr II, \n95 F.4th at 170 (Richardson, J., concurring). \u201c[E]ven \nafter [Talevski],\u201d he said, the lower courts \u201ccontinue to \nlack the guidance inferior judges need.\u201d Id. \n*** \n \nThe uncertainty regarding the statuses of \nWright, Wilder, and Blessing causes more than just \nheadaches for concurring judges. It has led to greater \n\n19 \n \nuncertainty for the States as well. When a State \naccepts money from the federal government, it accepts \nthe conditions attached to those funds. As the Court \nexplained in Pennhurst, the conditions attached to \nfederal funding must be clear and unambiguous. 451 \nU.S. at 17. This includes whether a State is subject to \nsuit\u2014especially, as here, where the State may be liable \nfor monetary damages and attorney\u2019s fees. But, \nbecause courts are uncertain about the law, there is no \nconsistency in determining whether a Spending \nClause statute confers an \u201cunambiguous\u201d individual \nright of action privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983. So, \nthe States cannot determine whether they can be sued \nby individuals under any given Spending Clause \nstatute. \nCONCLUSION \nThe factors first identified in Wright and Wilder, \nand compiled into a simple multi-factor test by \nblessing, arguably never gave States the required clear \nnotice of their obligations under the Spending Clause. \nRecognizing this, the Court has retreated from them, \neither by implying they have been overturned or by not \nmentioning them at all. \nThe lower courts have not revived the message, \nand are still subjecting States to suits under statutes \nwith no clear and unambiguous private right of action. \nThis case presents the appropriate vehicle for the \nCourt to expressly say Wright, Wilder, and Blessing \nare no longer good law and to restore State and federal \nbalance. The Court should, therefore, grant the \npetition. \n \n\n20 \n \nRespectfully submitted this the 5th day of July, \n2024,  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKRIS KOBACH \nAttorney General \n \n/s/ Anthony Powell \nANTHONY POWELL \nSolicitor General \nABHISHEK S.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal thought process, a meta-level reflection on the current state of my knowledge and information-gathering strategy. It does not introduce new substantive facts or legal arguments about the case itself. Instead, it confirms my existing model of the case and clarifies the most significant remaining uncertainty. Therefore, my previous beliefs are preserved and reinforced.\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (The Core Conflict & Petitioner's Strategy):** My understanding of the central legal conflict and the petitioner's refined arguments remains the core of my predictive model.\n    *   **The *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* Framework:** The case still hinges on whether the \"any qualified provider\" provision contains \"unambiguously conferred rights\" enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n    *   **Petitioner's Restrictive Test:** The petitioner's two-pronged test\u2014requiring either the explicit word \"right\" or constitutional-style phrasing (\"No person shall...\")\u2014remains the most significant offensive legal argument in the case. It offers the Court a clear, formalistic rule to limit private rights of action, which I continue to believe will be attractive to the current majority.\n    *   **Petitioner's Factual & Procedural Framing:** The petitioner's arguments that this case is about the state's power to define \"qualified\" and that the state's administrative process was the \"exclusive remedy\" are still key components of their case.\n\n2.  **Preserved Beliefs (Respondent's Foundational Arguments):** The respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) continues to serve as the foundation for their counter-narrative and legal position.\n    *   **Confirmed Textual Argument:** The respondent's primary argument remains a direct textual one based on the existing *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework. They argue that the phrase **\"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\"** is the quintessential \"individual-centric\" and \"rights-creating\" language that the Court has consistently recognized.\n    *   **Confirmed Factual Rebuttal to \"Qualified\" Argument:** The respondent's assertion that South Carolina **conceded** that Planned Parenthood was \"perfectly competent\" and terminated them for reasons extraneous to qualification (performing abortions) remains a powerful factual counterpoint. This argument seeks to render the petitioner's legal theory about defining \"qualified\" irrelevant to the actual facts.\n    *   **Confirmed Rebuttal to \"Alternative Remedy\" Argument:** The respondent's position, grounded in precedent like *Patsy v. Board of Regents*, that \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs need not exhaust state administrative remedies, remains their direct answer to the petitioner's procedural claims.\n    *   **Patient-Centric Framing:** The respondent's narrative focus on the concrete harm to individual patients remains a key strategic contrast to the petitioner's abstract, structural arguments.\n\n3.  **Synthesized Understanding & Refined Uncertainty (Confirmed by Observation):** The latest observation explicitly confirms that the central battle is over the future of the *Gonzaga* test itself.\n    *   **Petitioner's Goal:** To convince the Court to *add a new, formalistic gloss* to the *Gonzaga* test (the \"right\" or \"No person shall...\" rule).\n    *   **Respondent's Goal:** To convince the Court that the *existing Gonzaga/Talevski standard is sufficient* and that the statutory text plainly meets it.\n\n4.  **New Procedural Insight & Solidified Uncertainty:** The primary contribution of the latest observation is not new information, but a clarification of what information is missing and most critical.\n    *   **Identified Information Gap:** The observation formally identifies that the respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) predates the petitioner's merits brief. Therefore, it does not\u2014and cannot\u2014contain a direct rebuttal to the petitioner's novel two-pronged test.\n    *   **Heightened Importance of Respondent's Merits Brief:** My model now explicitly recognizes that the single most important piece of outstanding evidence is the **respondent's merits brief**. This document will reveal their specific strategy for dismantling the petitioner's proposed restrictive test. My uncertainty has shifted from a general question of *what* the respondent will argue to the highly specific question of *how* they will counter this particular test. This document is the key to determining whether the respondent's defense of the status quo has enough force to overcome the jurisprudential appeal of the petitioner's simple, bright-line rule.",

This coalition is not just arguing the case but actively trying to shift the legal landscape by proposing a spectrum of restrictive tests. The single greatest source of uncertainty, therefore, is the respondent's counter-argument. This action\u2014retrieving the respondent's merits brief\u2014is not just informative; it is the most crucial action possible to resolve the central question of the case. It will reveal how the respondent plans to defend the existing legal framework against this multi-front assault. The potential for a significant update to my posterior belief about the case outcome is maximal, making the Task EIG a 1.0. For Design EIG, this action provides a textbook example of the primacy of merits briefs in SCOTUS prediction and offers a valuable case study in how a respondent counters not just a petitioner but also an influential amicus coalition.

The information density is extremely high (0.95) given the detailed breakdown of legal tests, coalition dynamics, policy arguments, and strategic framing, reflecting a comprehensive and richly detailed belief state.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "My previous beliefs centered on the legal conflict between the petitioner's proposed restrictive two-pronged test for \u00a7 1983 rights and the respondent's defense of the existing *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework. The most significant uncertainty was how the respondent would counter the petitioner's novel test in their yet-to-be-seen merits brief. The new observation, an amicus brief from 18 states supporting the petitioner, does not fill that information gap but provides a powerful new signal that significantly refines my understanding of the petitioner's coalition and the broader stakes of the case.\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (Core Legal Conflict):** The fundamental legal question remains whether the \"any qualified provider\" provision contains an \"unambiguously conferred right\" enforceable under \u00a7 1983. The petitioner's two-pronged test (requiring the word \"right\" or \"No person shall...\" phrasing) and the respondent's reliance on the existing individual-centric language (\"any individual... may obtain\") are still the central legal arguments.\n\n2.  **Reinforced & Amplified Beliefs (Strength of Petitioner's Position):** The amicus brief from Kansas and 17 other states provides strong evidence of a coordinated effort by states to narrow \u00a7 1983 liability.\n    *   **Bolstered Support:** The petitioner is not acting alone. A significant coalition of states is actively lobbying the Court for a restrictive ruling, adding political and federalism-based weight to the petitioner's legal arguments.\n    *   **New Policy Arguments:** The amici introduce explicit policy arguments focused on the high costs of litigation and the sovereign harm to states caused by the current, uncertain legal standard. They frame the issue as one of unconstitutional lack of notice and fiscal burden, which are arguments likely to resonate with the Court's conservative majority.\n    *   **Strategic Framing:** The brief highlights the circuit split between the Fourth and Fifth Circuits as proof that the *Blessing*/*Gonzaga* framework is unworkable, labeling the Fourth Circuit's process a \"litigation carousel\" while praising the Fifth Circuit's restrictive approach as the \"constitutionally required result.\"\n\n3.  **New Insight (Introduction of a Maximalist Position):** The amicus brief introduces a legal test even more restrictive than the petitioner's.\n    *   **The \"Explicit Statement\" Test:** The states argue that \"nothing short of an explicit statement from Congress declaring that a Spending Clause statute contains a private right of action\" should suffice. This is a maximalist position that goes beyond the petitioner's more \"modest\" textual test.\n    *   **Shifting the Overton Window:** By proposing this extreme option, the amici may make the petitioner's two-pronged test appear as a more reasonable, centrist-conservative compromise. It gives the Court a spectrum of restrictive options, potentially making it easier for a justice like Roberts or Kavanaugh to join a majority opinion that adopts the petitioner's test as a middle ground, rather than taking the more radical step of explicitly requiring a \"magic words\" declaration from Congress.\n    *   **Raising the Stakes:** The amici explicitly call for the Court to \"declare that *Wright*, *Wilder*, and *Blessing* are no longer good law.\" This confirms that the petitioner's side sees this case as an opportunity not just to add a gloss to *Gonzaga*, but to fundamentally dismantle the precedents that *Gonzaga* sought to limit.\n\n4.  **Refined Uncertainty (Increased Pressure on Respondent):** The core uncertainty\u2014the content of the respondent's merits brief\u2014remains, but its importance is now magnified. The respondent's task is more challenging than previously understood. They must now defend the status quo not only against the petitioner's specific test but also against a broader, more aggressive assault on the entire legal framework, backed by a large coalition of states and their powerful federalism arguments. The respondent's brief will be the key piece of evidence to determine if the textual arguments for the existing framework can withstand this multi-front attack.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous beliefs were centered on the stark contrast between the petitioner's novel, restrictive two-pronged test for \u00a7 1983 rights and the anticipated defense of the existing *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework by the respondent. The amicus brief from 18 states had amplified the pressure on the respondent by introducing powerful federalism arguments and a maximalist \"explicit statement\" test, shifting the Overton window. The primary uncertainty was how the respondent would structure their defense against this multi-front assault. The observation of the respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) has now resolved this key uncertainty, providing a clear view of their legal strategy and fundamentally clarifying the central battleground of the case.\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (Core Legal Conflict & Petitioner's Coalition):** The fundamental legal dispute remains a clash between two competing visions for enforcing Spending Clause legislation. The petitioner, backed by a significant coalition of states, continues to advocate for a new, highly restrictive textual test (requiring \"magic words\" like \"right\" or \"No person shall...\") to limit state liability under \u00a7 1983. The policy arguments from the state amici regarding fiscal burdens and the \"litigation carousel\" of the current standard remain a powerful force likely to appeal to the Court's conservative wing.\n\n2.  **Resolved Uncertainty (Respondent's Defensive Strategy):** The BIO eliminates the major uncertainty about the respondent's strategy. They are not proposing a new test or a compromise. Instead, their strategy is a full-throated defense of the existing legal framework, anchored in the Court's most recent precedent on this very issue.\n    *   **Confirmation of Reliance on Existing Framework:** As anticipated, the respondent's argument rests entirely on the established *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* test. They argue that the Fourth Circuit \"faithfully apply[ed]\" this Court's precedents.\n    *   **Direct Textual Argument:** The respondent's case is built on a direct textual analysis of the free-choice-of-provider provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)). They contend that the phrase \"**any individual** eligible for medical assistance... **may obtain** such assistance\" is the quintessential \"rights-creating,\" \"individual-centric language\" with an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" that *Gonzaga* and *Talevski* require. This is their direct counterargument to the petitioner's demand for specific \"magic words.\"\n\n3.  **New & Refined Beliefs (The Centrality of *Talevski*):** The BIO elevates *Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski* from a relevant precedent to the central battleground of the entire case.\n    *   ***Talevski* as a Broad Reaffirmation:** The respondent frames *Talevski* not as a narrow holding limited to its specific facts (the FNHRA), but as the Court's definitive and recent reaffirmation of the *Gonzaga* \"established method for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\" of individual rights.\n    *   **A Test of *Stare Decisis*:** This framing creates a powerful *stare decisis* argument. The respondent is effectively arguing that the petitioner and their amici are asking the Court to dramatically narrow or functionally overrule a major precedent just one year after it was decided. This argument is designed to appeal to the Court's institutionalist wing, particularly Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, who were in the *Talevski* majority.\n    *   **Framing the Petitioner's Test as Radical:** By anchoring their position in very recent precedent, the respondent can portray the petitioner's two-pronged test (and the amici's even more restrictive version) as a radical departure from established law, rather than a modest clarification.\n\n4.  **Refined Uncertainty (Will the *Talevski* Framework Hold?):** The uncertainty has shifted. It is no longer *what* the respondent will argue, but *whether* their defense of the recently-reaffirmed status quo will persuade a majority. The core question for predicting the outcome is now:\n    *   How will the Court interpret its own GVR (Grant, Vacate, Remand) order? The respondent argues the Fourth Circuit correctly followed the GVR's instruction by applying *Talevski* and reaching the same conclusion. The petitioner must convince the Court that the Fourth Circuit misread *Talevski*'s implications.\n    *   Will the majority view this case as a straightforward application of *Talevski*'s logic, or will they see *Talevski* as a unique case and use this opportunity to draw the brighter, more restrictive line on \u00a7 1983 liability that the petitioner and state amici are demanding? The outcome will likely depend on whether justices like Roberts and Kavanaugh see a meaningful distinction between the statutory language here and the language in *Talevski*, or if they are persuaded by the federalism and fiscal arguments to create a new, narrower test despite their recent ruling.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal thought process, a reflection on the current state of knowledge and a plan for future information gathering. It did not contain new external evidence or legal arguments related to the case. Therefore, my previous beliefs remain stable and are reaffirmed as the current, most accurate model of the legal landscape.\n\n1.  **Preserved Beliefs (Core Legal Conflict & Petitioner's Coalition):** The fundamental legal dispute remains a clash between two competing visions for enforcing Spending Clause legislation. The petitioner, backed by a significant coalition of states, continues to advocate for a new, highly restrictive textual test (requiring \"magic words\" like \"right\" or \"No person shall...\") to limit state liability under \u00a7 1983. The policy arguments from the state amici regarding fiscal burdens and the \"litigation carousel\" of the current standard remain a powerful force likely to appeal to the Court's conservative wing.\n\n2.  **Resolved Uncertainty (Respondent's Defensive Strategy):** The Brief in Opposition (BIO) has eliminated the major uncertainty about the respondent's strategy. They are not proposing a new test or a compromise. Instead, their strategy is a full-throated defense of the existing legal framework, anchored in the Court's most recent precedent on this very issue.\n    *   **Confirmation of Reliance on Existing Framework:** The respondent's argument rests entirely on the established *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* test. They argue that the Fourth Circuit \"faithfully apply[ed]\" this Court's precedents.\n    *   **Direct Textual Argument:** The respondent's case is built on a direct textual analysis of the free-choice-of-provider provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)). They contend that the phrase \"**any individual** eligible for medical assistance... **may obtain** such assistance\" is the quintessential \"rights-creating,\" \"individual-centric language\" with an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" that *Gonzaga* and *Talevski* require. This is their direct counterargument to the petitioner's demand for specific \"magic words.\"\n\n3.  **New & Refined Beliefs (The Centrality of *Talevski*):** The BIO elevates *Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski* from a relevant precedent to the central battleground of the entire case.\n    *   ***Talevski* as a Broad Reaffirmation:** The respondent frames *Talevski* not as a narrow holding limited to its specific facts (the FNHRA), but as the Court's definitive and recent reaffirmation of the *Gonzaga* \"established method for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\" of individual rights.\n    *   **A Test of *Stare Decisis*:** This framing creates a powerful *stare decisis* argument. The respondent is effectively arguing that the petitioner and their amici are asking the Court to dramatically narrow or functionally overrule a major precedent just one year after it was decided. This argument is designed to appeal to the Court's institutionalist wing, particularly Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, who were in the *Talevski* majority.\n    *   **Framing the Petitioner's Test as Radical:** By anchoring their position in very recent precedent, the respondent can portray the petitioner's two-pronged test (and the amici's even more restrictive version) as a radical departure from established law, rather than a modest clarification.\n\n4.  **Refined Uncertainty (Will the *Talevski* Framework Hold?):** The uncertainty has shifted. It is no longer *what* the respondent will argue, but *whether* their defense of the recently-reaffirmed status quo will persuade a majority. The observation, while not providing new evidence, correctly identifies that the next critical data point will be the respondent's merits brief, which will contain their direct, point-by-point rebuttal to the petitioner's novel two-pronged test. The core question for predicting the outcome remains:\n    *   How will the Court interpret its own GVR (Grant, Vacate, Remand) order? The respondent argues the Fourth Circuit correctly followed the GVR's instruction by applying *Talevski* and reaching the same conclusion. The petitioner must convince the Court that the Fourth Circuit misread *Talevski*'s implications.\n    *   Will the majority view this case as a straightforward application of *Talevski*'s logic, or will they see *Talevski* as a unique case and use this opportunity to draw the brighter, more restrictive line on \u00a7 1983 liability that the petitioner and state amici are demanding? The outcome will likely depend on whether justices like Roberts and Kavanaugh see a meaningful distinction between the statutory language here and the language in *Talevski*, or if they are persuaded by the federalism and fiscal arguments to create a new, narrower test despite their recent ruling.",

The respondent's strategy, confirmed by their Brief in Opposition, is to argue that the free-choice-of-provider provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A))\u2014with its focus on \"**any individual**... **may obtain** such assistance\"\u2014is the exact type of \"rights-creating\" language the Court's precedents require.\n\n2.  **Preserved Beliefs (The Centrality of *Talevski*):** *Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski* remains the central battleground. The respondent's argument frames the petitioner's request as a demand for the Court to functionally overrule or dramatically narrow a major precedent just one year after it was decided, creating a powerful *stare decisis* challenge aimed at the Court's institutionalist wing.\n\n3.  **New & Refined Beliefs (Litigation Intensity and Counsel):** A new observation, a letter regarding a filing extension, provides two key signals about the nature of the case:\n    *   **Identification of Elite Counsel:** The letter confirms that respondents are represented by Nicole A. Saharsky of Mayer Brown. Saharsky is a highly respected and experienced Supreme Court advocate. The retention of such top-tier counsel is a strong signal of the case's perceived high stakes. It indicates that the respondents view this not as a simple statutory interpretation case, but as a fundamental threat to the enforcement of rights under Spending Clause legislation, warranting a maximum investment in legal resources.\n    *   **Assertive Procedural Posture:** The letter's content\u2014an opposition to a brief three-day extension for the petitioner's reply brief\u2014reveals an assertive and somewhat adversarial litigation strategy. While procedural, this refusal to consent to a routine request suggests the respondents' legal team is confident and aims to maintain maximum procedural pressure on the petitioner. It indicates the case is being fought vigorously on every front, complementing the understanding that the substantive legal stakes are immense.\n\n4.  **Stable Uncertainty (Will the *Talevski* Framework Hold?):** The new information, while contextually important, does not alter the core legal uncertainty. The central question remains whether a majority of the Court, particularly justices who were in the *Talevski* majority like Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, will see this case as a straightforward application of that recent precedent or will be persuaded by the petitioner's and state amici's federalism and fiscal arguments to create a new, more restrictive standard for \u00a7 1983 liability. The confirmation of elite counsel and the contentious procedural environment simply raises the temperature, underscoring that the Court's decision will be a landmark one for Spending Clause jurisprudence, regardless of the outcome.",
