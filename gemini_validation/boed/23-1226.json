    "facts_of_the_case": "True Health Chiropractic, Inc. and McLaughlin Chiropractic Associates, Inc. filed a class action lawsuit against McKesson Corporation and McKesson Technologies, Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited advertisements via fax. They claimed they neither invited nor gave permission to receive these faxes, and even if there was permission or an established business relationship, the faxes lacked the required opt-out notice.\n\nThe district court initially granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on McKesson's consent defenses. The court also decertified the proposed class and denied treble damages to the plaintiffs. McKesson appealed the summary judgment decision on their consent defenses. The plaintiffs cross-appealed the class decertification and denial of treble damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the summary judgment de novo, the decertification order for abuse of discretion, and the denial of treble damages for abuse of discretion, ultimately affirming all of the district court\u2019s decisions.",

The plan to start with the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the most logical and efficient first step to understand the petitioner's arguments and the core legal question. This significantly improves the 'understanding of how to predict' the outcome by structuring the subsequent, more informative actions. Therefore, it has a moderate Task EIG. The Design EIG is high because the articulated strategy\u2014'start with the Petition to understand the core arguments'\u2014is a fundamental and highly generalizable principle for analyzing any SCOTUS case.

This document is the single most important source of information at this stage. It will provide the petitioner's entire framing of the issue, the precedents they rely on, and their arguments for why the lower court erred. This will cause a massive update to my belief state, moving from a general understanding of the question to a specific understanding of one party's case, which is essential for prediction.

A majority \nof the Court, however, \u201cfound it difficult to answer this \nquestion\u201d because of \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that had \nbeen raised by the petitioner but had not been addressed \nby the court of appeals: (1) whether the FCC order at issue \nwas an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d such that it might not be subject \nto the Hobbs Act, and (2) whether the Hobbs Act failed to \nafford the petitioner \u201ca \u2018prior\u2019 and \u2018adequate\u2019 opportunity \nfor judicial review\u201d of the order such that the order might \nbe subject to review in an enforcement suit under section \n703 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Id. at 2055\u201356. \nDepending on how these questions might be answered, it \nwas at least possible that the FCC\u2019s interpretation could \nbe challenged in the district court without respect to the \nquestion presented. As a result, the Court remanded so \nthe lower court could consider these two issues in the first \ninstance and did not answer the question presented. \nFour members of the Court, by contrast, would have \nreached \u201cthe question that we granted certiorari to \ndecide.\u201d Id. at 2058 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). Speaking \non their behalf, Justice Kavanaugh wrote separately to \nexplain that the Hobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party in an \nenforcement suit \u201cfrom arguing that the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. That conclusion \nflowed, he observed, from a \u201cstraightforward\u201d analysis of \nthe text of the Hobbs Act. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean \nWater Act and Clean Air Act\u2014\u201cexpressly preclude \n\n- 2 - \n \njudicial review in subsequent enforcement actions\u201d and \ntherefore bar parties in those actions from arguing that \nthe agency misinterpreted the statute. Id. at 2059. But \nunlike those statutes, the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent about \nreview in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 2060. So \nthe \u201cgeneral rule of administrative law\u201d kicks in and \nallows a party to argue, and a district court to consider, \nthat the FCC\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong. In \nother words, the court is \u201cnot bound by the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation\u201d\u2014a reading of the statute that is \nreinforced by the \u201cserious constitutional issue[s]\u201d raised \nby a rule barring both a party and a district court in an \n\u201cas-applied enforcement action\u201d from entertaining \narguments \u201cabout the reach and authority of agency \nrules.\u201d Id. at 2062. Justice Kavanaugh noted that his \nanalysis of the Hobbs Act\u2019s proper interpretation \n\u201cremains available to other courts in the future.\u201d Id. at \n2058. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to resolve the \nquestion presented, but left undecided, in PDR Network. \nLike PDR Network, this case involves an enforcement \naction brought under the TCPA in a federal district court. \nAnd like PDR Network, a party to the action argued that \nan FCC order incorrectly interpreted the TCPA. Both \ncourts below held that such an argument was foreclosed \nby the Hobbs Act. The district court openly \u201cagree[d] with \n\u2026 Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR Network,\u201d \nPet. App. 39a n.7, but \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \nit to \u201ctreat [the FCC order] as authoritative\u201d because this \nCourt \u201cdid not resolve the central issue presented,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. The Ninth Circuit then refused to revisit its \nposition on appeal. Without even citing PDR Network, it \nheld that the district court was \u201cbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s \norder under the Hobbs Act. Pet. App. 7a. It then denied \n\n- 3 - \n \nen banc review. The case thus cleanly presents the same \nquestion as in PDR Network. \nUnlike in PDR Network, however, neither of the two \npreliminary issues that thwarted resolution of the central \nquestion pose a barrier to this Court\u2019s review. First, as the \ndistrict court recognized, it \u201cdoes not matter\u201d whether the \nFCC\u2019s order is properly characterized as an \u201cinterpretive \nrule\u201d or a \u201clegislative rule[]\u201d given Ninth Circuit \nprecedent on this question. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a & n.5. While \nother circuits have held that interpretive rules fall outside \nthe Hobbs Act, the Ninth Circuit has held the opposite. \nUnder its caselaw, both interpretive rules and legislative \nrules are subject to the Hobbs Act. So unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the court of appeals here has already spoken on \nthis preliminary issue.  \nSecond, the other preliminary issue poses no barrier \neither. In PDR Network, the petitioner argued that it did \nnot have an \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity under the Hobbs Act \nto challenge the FCC\u2019s order because the order was issued \nmany years before the enforcement action was filed. Were \nthat correct, as this Court noted, section 703 of the APA \nmight permit a later challenge in an enforcement action. \nBut that question is not present here. The petitioner did \nnot argue that it lacked a prior or adequate opportunity to \nseek review of the FCC\u2019s order under the Hobbs Act. \nInstead, the only question that was before the court of \nappeals\u2014and the one that is squarely presented by this \npetition\u2014is whether the Hobbs Act required the district \ncourt to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA. \nWith no obstacle to review, this Court should take this \ncase to decide the question that it intended to decide in \nPDR Network. Properly construed, the Hobbs Act does \nnot require district courts to give FCC orders \u201cabsolute \n\n- 4 - \n \ndeference\u201d in garden-variety enforcement actions. PDR \nNetwork, 139 S. Ct. at 2066 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary view should be reversed.  \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s unreported decision is available at \n2023 WL 7015279 and reproduced at Pet.

On \nMarch 13, 2024, this Court extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to May 17, 2024\u2014\n149 days from the date rehearing was denied. This Court\u2019s \njurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1), provides in \nrelevant part: \nThe court of appeals (other than the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) has \nexclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend \n(in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof\u2014 \n\n- 5 - \n \n(1) all final orders of the Federal Communication \nCommission made reviewable by section 402(a) of \ntitle 47. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 \n(TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, as amended \nby the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n21, 119 Stat. 359, is codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3) and \nprovides in relevant part: \nThe term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d means \nequipment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe \ntext or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or \nimages (or both) from an electronic signal received \nover a regular telephone line onto paper. \nSTATEMENT \nI.  Factual background \nA. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nprohibits the sending of unsolicited \nadvertisements via fax.  \nCongress passed the TCPA in response to the public\u2019s \n\u201coutrage[] over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance \ncalls.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227 note.1 As amended by the Junk Fax \nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 109-21, 119 Stat. 359, the law \ntargets \u201ca number of problems associated with junk \nfaxes.\u201d Imhoff Inv., LLC v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F.3d 627, \n633 (6th Cir. 2015). Junk faxes often force the recipient, \nfrequently small businesses, to incur significant costs in \n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all internal quotation marks, \nemphases, alterations, and citations are omitted from quotations \nthroughout. \n\n- 6 - \n \nthe form of \u201cpaper and ink\u201d and \u201ctied up\u201d fax lines, id., \nwhile also \u201cinterrupt[ing] the recipient\u2019s privacy\u201d and \nplacing unnecessary stress on the \u201crecipient\u2019s fax \nmachines.\u201d ER415.  \nFor these reasons, Congress made it unlawful \u201cto use \nany telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other \ndevice to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \nunsolicited advertisement.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). And \nit broadly defined the term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \nto include any \u201cequipment which has the capacity (A) to \ntranscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a regular \ntelephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or images (or both) \nfrom an electronic signal received over a regular \ntelephone line onto paper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3).  \nIn the years since the TCPA was amended to prohibit \nusing fax machines to send unsolicited advertisements, \nintrepid marketers have shifted much of their advertising \ncampaigns online. But as both the FCC and courts have \nlong explained, the TCPA\u2019s bar on unsolicited faxes \nextends to cover faxes sent from and to \u201ccomputerized\u201d \nfax machines, which qualify as a \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d under the statute. See In re Rules & Regs. \nImplementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 68 FR \n44144-01, \u00b6 143 (FCC July 25, 2003).  \nThat is because the TCPA \u201cbroadly applies to any \nequipment that has the capacity to send or receive text or \nimages,\u201d which \u201censure[s] that the prohibition on \nunsolicited faxing\u201d cannot be easily circumvented as \ntechnology changes. Id. at \u00b6 144 (emphasis added) (noting \nthat \u201cCongress could not have intended to allow easy \ncircumvention of its prohibition when faxes are . . . \ntransmitted to personal computers and fax servers, rather \n\n- 7 - \n \nthan traditional stand-alone facsimile machines\u201d); see also \nid. \u00b6 145 (noting that unsolicited faxes sent to a recipient\u2019s \n\u201cinbox\u201d still risk \u201cshift[ing] the advertising cost of paper \nand toner to the recipient\u201d and \u201cmay also tie up lines and \nprinters so that the recipients\u2019 requested faxes are not \ntimely received\u201d); see also Lyngaas v. Curaden AG, 992 \nF.3d 412, 426 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that the TCPA\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \u201cencompasses \nmore than traditional fax machines\u201d and includes any \n\u201cequipment that has the capacity to transcribe text or \nimages from or onto paper\u2014as long as the electronic \nsignal is transmitted or received over a telephone line\u201d); \nMeyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, \n1043 (9th Cir. 2012) (similar for \u201cautomatic telephone \ndialing system\u201d).   \nB. McKesson sends unsolicited advertisements via \nfax in violation of the TCPA.   \nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company \nwith hundreds of subsidiaries or affiliated companies and \nbusinesses that range from the sale of pharmaceuticals to \nbehavioral coaching and information technology. ER4. \nOne of its business units, Physician Practice Solutions, \nregularly engages in promotional fax campaigns designed \nto \u201cmarket its products and services\u201d to physician \npractices throughout the country. ER8. To carry out this \nmarketing, McKesson \u201cemployed a fax broadcasting \ncompany\u201d to transmit faxes. ER6.  \nMcLaughlin Chiropractic Associates is one of the \nphysician practices targeted by McKesson. ER4. In 2009 \nand 2010, it, along with many other small medical \npractices, received multiple unsolicited advertisements \nvia fax from McKesson. ER417. These advertisements\u2014\nsome of which were received on stand-alone fax machines \n\n- 8 - \n \nand some of which were received through online fax \nservices\u2014marketed certain software products that \nMcKesson sold. ER5.   \nMcKesson was not unaware that engaging in this type \nof advertising campaign risked violating the TCPA. A \nyear earlier, in 2008, it was warned by the FCC that it had \n\u201csent one or more unsolicited advertisements\u201d via fax \u201cin \nviolation of the TCPA.\u201d ER4\u20135. The FCC issued \nMcKesson an \u201cofficial CITATION\u201d and notified the \ncompany that, in the future, it would bear the burden to \nshow that it had complied with the TCPA in the event of \nany \u201ccomplaint or dispute.\u201d ER5.  \nII. Procedural background \nA. Having received the unlawful faxes, McLaughlin \nChiropractic \nand \nanother \npractice, \nTrue \nHealth \nChiropractic, Inc., sued McKesson on behalf of themselves \nand a proposed class for sending unsolicited fax \nadvertisements in violation of the TCPA, 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). ER450.  \nAfter several years of litigation and an appeal to the \nNinth Circuit from the denial of class certification, True \nHealth Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923 \n(9th Cir. 2018), the district court eventually certified a \nsingle class of all persons or entities whose fax numbers \nhad been previously identified and \u201cwho received faxes \nfrom McKesson from September 2, 2009, to May 11, 2010\u201d \noffering various promotional products and services \nwithout being notified of their right to opt out of future \nfaxes. ER71. It appointed McLaughlin Chiropractic\u2014the \npetitioner here\u2014to represent the class. Id. \nB. Shortly after the class was certified\u2014six years into \nthe litigation\u2014the FCC issued an order interpreting the \n\n- 9 - \n \ntext of the TCPA provision at issue here. See Pet. App. \n46a. In this so-called Amerifactors order, the FCC \nconstrued the TCPA to exclude an \u201conline fax service\u201d \nfrom the definition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 48a. In the FCC\u2019s view, an \u201conline fax service that \neffectively receives faxes sent as email over the Internet\u201d \nis \u201cnot itself equipment which has the capacity to \ntranscribe text or images (or both) from an electronic \nsignal received over a regular telephone line onto paper\u201d \nand so \u201cfalls outside the scope of the statutory \nprohibition.\u201d Id. The FCC further reasoned that, because \nan online fax service \u201ccannot itself print a fax,\u201d it did not \nimplicate the specific harms Congress addressed in the \nTCPA, namely \u201cadvertiser cost-shifting.\u201d Pet. App. 52a\u2013\n53a. An application for review of the order was filed before \nthe FCC in early 2020 by other entities. SER121. Four \nyears later, the FCC has yet to act on it.  \nC. The FCC\u2019s intervening order forced the district \ncourt to address what impact, if any, it had on this case. \nAlthough the court \u201cagree[d] with the reasoning of Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR,\u201d it recognized that \n\u201cthese questions are obviously for another day, and for a \nhigher court than this one.\u201d Pet. App. 39a n.7. That was \nbecause, \u201cunder Ninth Circuit precedent,\u201d the court was \nrequired to \u201ctreat Amerifactors as authoritative.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. \nIn reaching that conclusion, the district court rejected \nthe argument that the Amerifactors order was an \n\u201cinterpretive rule\u201d that falls outside the scope of the \nHobbs Act. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a. \u201cEven assuming (without \ndeciding)\u201d that this \u201ccharacterization of Amerifactors\u201d \nwas correct, the court wrote, it \u201cdoes not matter.\u201d Id. \nUnder controlling Ninth Circuit caselaw, so long as the \n\n- 10 - \n \nrelevant FCC order is \u201cfinal,\u201d the Hobbs Act applies \nregardless of whether the order is characterized as \n\u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cinterpretive.\u201d Id. (noting that the Ninth \nCircuit held, in U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Hamilton, 224 \nF.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000), that the Hobbs Act \n\u201ccontains no exception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case \nlaw does not create one\u201d). As a result, according to the \ndistrict court, the Amerifactors order was \u201ca final, binding \norder for purposes of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \nThe district court also held that it did not matter that \nan application for review of the Amerifactors order was \npending before the FCC. According to both FCC \nregulations and case law, reconsideration petitions do \u201cnot \naffect the order\u2019s finality as it applies to [a defendant\u2019s] \npotential liability under the TCPA.\u201d Id. (citing 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1.102(b)(1); Comm. To Save WEAM v. FCC, 808 F.2d \n113, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  \nUltimately, although the district court recognized the \nneed for \u201ccritical guidance\u201d on whether, in light of PDR \nNetwork, an FCC order like Amerifactors could bind \nfederal district courts in enforcement proceedings, it \nobserved that \u201cAmerifactors changed the landscape for \nTCPA litigation,\u201d and \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \ncourts to \u201cfollow the FCC\u2019s interpretation.\u201d Pet. App. 20a. \nThat meant two things for this case: First, because the \nFCC\u2019s Amerifactors order was \u201cdeterminative of the \nviability of this case,\u201d the court held that it was required \nto apply the order retroactively and to decertify the class \non that basis. Id. Second, it also required the entry of \nsummary judgment in favor of McKesson for those claims \ninvolving the receipt of faxes via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d \nER20\u201321.  \n\n- 11 - \n \nD. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Without citing or \ndiscussing PDR Network, it held that the district court \n\u201ccorrectly found that that it was bound by the [FCC\u2019s] \nAmerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined that \nthe TCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. That was so, in the Ninth \nCircuit\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc. 139 S. Ct. 2051, 2055 (2019). A majority \nof the Court, however, \u201cfound it difficult to answer this \nquestion\u201d because of \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that had \nbeen raised by the petitioner but had not been addressed \nby the court of appeals: (1) whether the FCC order at issue \nwas an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d such that it might not be subject \nto the Hobbs Act, and (2) whether the Hobbs Act failed to \nafford the petitioner \u201ca \u2018prior\u2019 and \u2018adequate\u2019 opportunity \nfor judicial review\u201d of the order such that the order might \nbe subject to review in an enforcement suit under section \n703 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Id. at 2055\u201356. \nDepending on how these questions might be answered, it \nwas at least possible that the FCC\u2019s interpretation could \nbe challenged in the district court without respect to the \nquestion presented. As a result, the Court remanded so \nthe lower court could consider these two issues in the first \ninstance and did not answer the question presented. \nFour members of the Court, by contrast, would have \nreached \u201cthe question that we granted certiorari to \ndecide.\u201d Id. at 2058 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). Speaking \non their behalf, Justice Kavanaugh wrote separately to \nexplain that the Hobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party in an \nenforcement suit \u201cfrom arguing that the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. That conclusion \nflowed, he observed, from a \u201cstraightforward\u201d analysis of \nthe text of the Hobbs Act. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean \nWater Act and Clean Air Act\u2014\u201cexpressly preclude \n\n- 2 - \n \njudicial review in subsequent enforcement actions\u201d and \ntherefore bar parties in those actions from arguing that \nthe agency misinterpreted the statute. Id. at 2059. But \nunlike those statutes, the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent about \nreview in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 2060. So \nthe \u201cgeneral rule of administrative law\u201d kicks in and \nallows a party to argue, and a district court to consider, \nthat the FCC\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong. In \nother words, the court is \u201cnot bound by the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation\u201d\u2014a reading of the statute that is \nreinforced by the \u201cserious constitutional issue[s]\u201d raised \nby a rule barring both a party and a district court in an \n\u201cas-applied enforcement action\u201d from entertaining \narguments \u201cabout the reach and authority of agency \nrules.\u201d Id. at 2062. Justice Kavanaugh noted that his \nanalysis of the Hobbs Act\u2019s proper interpretation \n\u201cremains available to other courts in the future.\u201d Id. at \n2058. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to resolve the \nquestion presented, but left undecided, in PDR Network. \nLike PDR Network, this case involves an enforcement \naction brought under the TCPA in a federal district court. \nAnd like PDR Network, a party to the action argued that \nan FCC order incorrectly interpreted the TCPA. Both \ncourts below held that such an argument was foreclosed \nby the Hobbs Act. The district court openly \u201cagree[d] with \n\u2026 Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR Network,\u201d \nPet. App. 39a n.7, but \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \nit to \u201ctreat [the FCC order] as authoritative\u201d because this \nCourt \u201cdid not resolve the central issue presented,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. The Ninth Circuit then refused to revisit its \nposition on appeal. Without even citing PDR Network, it \nheld that the district court was \u201cbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s \norder under the Hobbs Act. Pet. App. 7a. It then denied \n\n- 3 - \n \nen banc review. The case thus cleanly presents the same \nquestion as in PDR Network. \nUnlike in PDR Network, however, neither of the two \npreliminary issues that thwarted resolution of the central \nquestion pose a barrier to this Court\u2019s review. First, as the \ndistrict court recognized, it \u201cdoes not matter\u201d whether the \nFCC\u2019s order is properly characterized as an \u201cinterpretive \nrule\u201d or a \u201clegislative rule[]\u201d given Ninth Circuit \nprecedent on this question. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a & n.5. While \nother circuits have held that interpretive rules fall outside \nthe Hobbs Act, the Ninth Circuit has held the opposite. \nUnder its caselaw, both interpretive rules and legislative \nrules are subject to the Hobbs Act. So unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the court of appeals here has already spoken on \nthis preliminary issue.  \nSecond, the other preliminary issue poses no barrier \neither. In PDR Network, the petitioner argued that it did \nnot have an \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity under the Hobbs Act \nto challenge the FCC\u2019s order because the order was issued \nmany years before the enforcement action was filed. Were \nthat correct, as this Court noted, section 703 of the APA \nmight permit a later challenge in an enforcement action. \nBut that question is not present here. The petitioner did \nnot argue that it lacked a prior or adequate opportunity to \nseek review of the FCC\u2019s order under the Hobbs Act. \nInstead, the only question that was before the court of \nappeals\u2014and the one that is squarely presented by this \npetition\u2014is whether the Hobbs Act required the district \ncourt to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA. \nWith no obstacle to review, this Court should take this \ncase to decide the question that it intended to decide in \nPDR Network. Properly construed, the Hobbs Act does \nnot require district courts to give FCC orders \u201cabsolute \n\n- 4 - \n \ndeference\u201d in garden-variety enforcement actions. PDR \nNetwork, 139 S. Ct. at 2066 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary view should be reversed.  \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s unreported decision is available at \n2023 WL 7015279 and reproduced at Pet.

No. 109-\n21, 119 Stat. 359, is codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3) and \nprovides in relevant part: \nThe term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d means \nequipment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe \ntext or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or \nimages (or both) from an electronic signal received \nover a regular telephone line onto paper. \nSTATEMENT \nI.  Factual background \nA. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nprohibits the sending of unsolicited \nadvertisements via fax.  \nCongress passed the TCPA in response to the public\u2019s \n\u201coutrage[] over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance \ncalls.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227 note.1 As amended by the Junk Fax \nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 109-21, 119 Stat. 359, the law \ntargets \u201ca number of problems associated with junk \nfaxes.\u201d Imhoff Inv., LLC v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F.3d 627, \n633 (6th Cir. 2015). Junk faxes often force the recipient, \nfrequently small businesses, to incur significant costs in \n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all internal quotation marks, \nemphases, alterations, and citations are omitted from quotations \nthroughout. \n\n- 6 - \n \nthe form of \u201cpaper and ink\u201d and \u201ctied up\u201d fax lines, id., \nwhile also \u201cinterrupt[ing] the recipient\u2019s privacy\u201d and \nplacing unnecessary stress on the \u201crecipient\u2019s fax \nmachines.\u201d ER415.  \nFor these reasons, Congress made it unlawful \u201cto use \nany telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other \ndevice to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \nunsolicited advertisement.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). And \nit broadly defined the term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \nto include any \u201cequipment which has the capacity (A) to \ntranscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a regular \ntelephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or images (or both) \nfrom an electronic signal received over a regular \ntelephone line onto paper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3).  \nIn the years since the TCPA was amended to prohibit \nusing fax machines to send unsolicited advertisements, \nintrepid marketers have shifted much of their advertising \ncampaigns online. But as both the FCC and courts have \nlong explained, the TCPA\u2019s bar on unsolicited faxes \nextends to cover faxes sent from and to \u201ccomputerized\u201d \nfax machines, which qualify as a \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d under the statute. See In re Rules & Regs. \nImplementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 68 FR \n44144-01, \u00b6 143 (FCC July 25, 2003).  \nThat is because the TCPA \u201cbroadly applies to any \nequipment that has the capacity to send or receive text or \nimages,\u201d which \u201censure[s] that the prohibition on \nunsolicited faxing\u201d cannot be easily circumvented as \ntechnology changes. Id. at \u00b6 144 (emphasis added) (noting \nthat \u201cCongress could not have intended to allow easy \ncircumvention of its prohibition when faxes are . . . \ntransmitted to personal computers and fax servers, rather \n\n- 7 - \n \nthan traditional stand-alone facsimile machines\u201d); see also \nid. \u00b6 145 (noting that unsolicited faxes sent to a recipient\u2019s \n\u201cinbox\u201d still risk \u201cshift[ing] the advertising cost of paper \nand toner to the recipient\u201d and \u201cmay also tie up lines and \nprinters so that the recipients\u2019 requested faxes are not \ntimely received\u201d); see also Lyngaas v. Curaden AG, 992 \nF.3d 412, 426 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that the TCPA\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \u201cencompasses \nmore than traditional fax machines\u201d and includes any \n\u201cequipment that has the capacity to transcribe text or \nimages from or onto paper\u2014as long as the electronic \nsignal is transmitted or received over a telephone line\u201d); \nMeyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, \n1043 (9th Cir. 2012) (similar for \u201cautomatic telephone \ndialing system\u201d).   \nB. McKesson sends unsolicited advertisements via \nfax in violation of the TCPA.   \nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company \nwith hundreds of subsidiaries or affiliated companies and \nbusinesses that range from the sale of pharmaceuticals to \nbehavioral coaching and information technology. ER4. \nOne of its business units, Physician Practice Solutions, \nregularly engages in promotional fax campaigns designed \nto \u201cmarket its products and services\u201d to physician \npractices throughout the country. ER8. To carry out this \nmarketing, McKesson \u201cemployed a fax broadcasting \ncompany\u201d to transmit faxes. ER6.  \nMcLaughlin Chiropractic Associates is one of the \nphysician practices targeted by McKesson. ER4. In 2009 \nand 2010, it, along with many other small medical \npractices, received multiple unsolicited advertisements \nvia fax from McKesson. ER417. These advertisements\u2014\nsome of which were received on stand-alone fax machines \n\n- 8 - \n \nand some of which were received through online fax \nservices\u2014marketed certain software products that \nMcKesson sold. ER5.   \nMcKesson was not unaware that engaging in this type \nof advertising campaign risked violating the TCPA. A \nyear earlier, in 2008, it was warned by the FCC that it had \n\u201csent one or more unsolicited advertisements\u201d via fax \u201cin \nviolation of the TCPA.\u201d ER4\u20135. The FCC issued \nMcKesson an \u201cofficial CITATION\u201d and notified the \ncompany that, in the future, it would bear the burden to \nshow that it had complied with the TCPA in the event of \nany \u201ccomplaint or dispute.\u201d ER5.  \nII. Procedural background \nA. Having received the unlawful faxes, McLaughlin \nChiropractic \nand \nanother \npractice, \nTrue \nHealth \nChiropractic, Inc., sued McKesson on behalf of themselves \nand a proposed class for sending unsolicited fax \nadvertisements in violation of the TCPA, 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). ER450.  \nAfter several years of litigation and an appeal to the \nNinth Circuit from the denial of class certification, True \nHealth Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923 \n(9th Cir. 2018), the district court eventually certified a \nsingle class of all persons or entities whose fax numbers \nhad been previously identified and \u201cwho received faxes \nfrom McKesson from September 2, 2009, to May 11, 2010\u201d \noffering various promotional products and services \nwithout being notified of their right to opt out of future \nfaxes. ER71. It appointed McLaughlin Chiropractic\u2014the \npetitioner here\u2014to represent the class. Id. \nB. Shortly after the class was certified\u2014six years into \nthe litigation\u2014the FCC issued an order interpreting the \n\n- 9 - \n \ntext of the TCPA provision at issue here. See Pet. App. \n46a. In this so-called Amerifactors order, the FCC \nconstrued the TCPA to exclude an \u201conline fax service\u201d \nfrom the definition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 48a. In the FCC\u2019s view, an \u201conline fax service that \neffectively receives faxes sent as email over the Internet\u201d \nis \u201cnot itself equipment which has the capacity to \ntranscribe text or images (or both) from an electronic \nsignal received over a regular telephone line onto paper\u201d \nand so \u201cfalls outside the scope of the statutory \nprohibition.\u201d Id. The FCC further reasoned that, because \nan online fax service \u201ccannot itself print a fax,\u201d it did not \nimplicate the specific harms Congress addressed in the \nTCPA, namely \u201cadvertiser cost-shifting.\u201d Pet. App. 52a\u2013\n53a. An application for review of the order was filed before \nthe FCC in early 2020 by other entities. SER121. Four \nyears later, the FCC has yet to act on it.  \nC. The FCC\u2019s intervening order forced the district \ncourt to address what impact, if any, it had on this case. \nAlthough the court \u201cagree[d] with the reasoning of Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR,\u201d it recognized that \n\u201cthese questions are obviously for another day, and for a \nhigher court than this one.\u201d Pet. App. 39a n.7. That was \nbecause, \u201cunder Ninth Circuit precedent,\u201d the court was \nrequired to \u201ctreat Amerifactors as authoritative.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. \nIn reaching that conclusion, the district court rejected \nthe argument that the Amerifactors order was an \n\u201cinterpretive rule\u201d that falls outside the scope of the \nHobbs Act. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a. \u201cEven assuming (without \ndeciding)\u201d that this \u201ccharacterization of Amerifactors\u201d \nwas correct, the court wrote, it \u201cdoes not matter.\u201d Id. \nUnder controlling Ninth Circuit caselaw, so long as the \n\n- 10 - \n \nrelevant FCC order is \u201cfinal,\u201d the Hobbs Act applies \nregardless of whether the order is characterized as \n\u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cinterpretive.\u201d Id. (noting that the Ninth \nCircuit held, in U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Hamilton, 224 \nF.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000), that the Hobbs Act \n\u201ccontains no exception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case \nlaw does not create one\u201d). As a result, according to the \ndistrict court, the Amerifactors order was \u201ca final, binding \norder for purposes of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \nThe district court also held that it did not matter that \nan application for review of the Amerifactors order was \npending before the FCC. According to both FCC \nregulations and case law, reconsideration petitions do \u201cnot \naffect the order\u2019s finality as it applies to [a defendant\u2019s] \npotential liability under the TCPA.\u201d Id. (citing 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1.102(b)(1); Comm. To Save WEAM v. FCC, 808 F.2d \n113, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  \nUltimately, although the district court recognized the \nneed for \u201ccritical guidance\u201d on whether, in light of PDR \nNetwork, an FCC order like Amerifactors could bind \nfederal district courts in enforcement proceedings, it \nobserved that \u201cAmerifactors changed the landscape for \nTCPA litigation,\u201d and \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \ncourts to \u201cfollow the FCC\u2019s interpretation.\u201d Pet. App. 20a. \nThat meant two things for this case: First, because the \nFCC\u2019s Amerifactors order was \u201cdeterminative of the \nviability of this case,\u201d the court held that it was required \nto apply the order retroactively and to decertify the class \non that basis. Id. Second, it also required the entry of \nsummary judgment in favor of McKesson for those claims \ninvolving the receipt of faxes via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d \nER20\u201321.  \n\n- 11 - \n \nD. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Without citing or \ndiscussing PDR Network, it held that the district court \n\u201ccorrectly found that that it was bound by the [FCC\u2019s] \nAmerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined that \nthe TCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. That was so, in the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s view, because the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusive-\njurisdiction \nprovision\u2014which \n\u201cencompasses \n\u2018any \nproceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any \norder\u2019\u201d of the FCC\u2014forecloses a district court in any \nenforcement action from even considering whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA is wrong. Pet. App. \n7a. The Ninth Circuit also confirmed that the FCC\u2019s \nAmerifactors decision was both an \u201corder\u201d of the FCC and \n\u201cfinal.\u201d Pet. App. 7a\u20139a. And the Ninth Circuit refused to \nrevisit its prior caselaw; despite the availability of Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s analysis in PDR Network, it denied without \ncomment a petition for rehearing en banc. Pet. App. 2a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nAs the district court in this case correctly recognized, \nwhether the Hobbs Act requires federal courts to treat an \nagency\u2019s legal interpretation of a federal statute as \n\u201cinvariably binding\u201d is a question that is in dire need of \n\u201ccritical guidance\u201d from a \u201chigher court.\u201d Pet. App. 20a, \n39a n.7. Five years ago, this Court planned to do just that \nwhen it granted review in PDR Network. But two \n\u201cpreliminary issues\u201d frustrated that plan, and the full \nCourt never reached the question. Since then, the \ndisagreement among the circuits over whether the Hobbs \nAct binds districts courts to FCC interpretations of the \nTCPA shows no sign of letting up, leading some judges to \ncall for a definitive resolution in \u201cthe earliest appropriate \n\n- 12 - \n \ncase.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., LP, 931 F.3d \n1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., concurring). \nThis is that case. The question presented here is \nidentical to the one this Court granted certiorari to decide \nin PDR Network but did not ultimately resolve. It was \nsquarely raised and passed on below, with the district \ncourt even acknowledging that its resolution was \n\u201cdeterminative of the viability of this case.\u201d Pet. App. 20. \nAnd, perhaps most importantly, neither of the two \nthreshold issues this Court identified in PDR Network \nposes an obstacle to review. In the Ninth Circuit, even \ninterpretive rules fall within the scope of the Hobbs Act, \nthus binding a district court, and the prior adequacy of \nHobbs Act review is not at issue in this appeal. This Court \nshould grant review to decide the question it did not reach \nin PDR Network.   \nI. \nThe question the Court granted certiorari to \ndecide in PDR Network remains certworthy.   \nThe five years since this Court granted certiorari in \nPDR Network have done nothing but increase the need for \nreview of the question presented.  \nA. At the time this Court granted review in PDR \nNetwork, the circuits were already split over whether the \nHobbs Act requires district courts adjudicating cases \nwithin their ordinary jurisdiction to treat FCC orders that \ninterpret the TCPA as binding precedent.  \nOn one side, the Fourth Circuit, Ninth Circuit, and \nEleventh Circuit all interpreted the Hobbs Act as \n\u201cunambiguously depriv[ing]\u201d the federal district courts of \nthe authority to question FCC orders even in private \nenforce proceedings. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc. \nv. PDR Network, LLC, 883 F.3d 459, 469 (4th Cir. 2018) \n\n- 13 - \n \n(stating that \u201cthe Hobbs Act requires a district court to \nfollow FCC interpretations of the TCPA\u201d); see also \nWilson v. A.H. Belo Cop., 87 F.3d 393, 400 (9th Cir. 1996) \n(holding that the Hobbs Act forecloses a district court \nfrom \u201cdisagree[ing]\u201d with any FCC order in a private \nTCPA enforcement action); Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection \nBureau, 768 F.3d 1110, 1120 (11th Cir. 2014) (ruling that \na district court \u201cexceed[s] its jurisdiction\u201d if it decides that \nan FCC order is \u201cinconsistent with the TCPA\u201d \n\u201c[r]egardless of which party invoke[s]\u201d the order or if the \nchallenge \u201carises in a dispute between private parties\u201d). \nOn the other side, the Second Circuit, Sixth Circuit, \nand Seventh Circuits all recognize that parties in a private \nenforcement action may challenge FCC interpretations of \nthe TCPA. In these circuits, federal courts remain free to \nconsider such challenges under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to \nthe agency\u2019s interpretation. See Physicians Healthsource, \nInc. v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharms., Inc., 847 F.3d 92, \n95 (2d Cir. 2017) (determining whether an FCC rule \n\u201ccomports with the [TCPA]\u201d before concluding what \neffect it should have in a private enforcement action); \nSandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. Medco Health Sols., Inc., \n788 F.3d 218, 223 (6th Cir. 2015) (recognizing a \u201ccircuit \nsplit\u201d on \u201cwhether to defer\u201d to the FCC\u2019s interpretation of \nthe TCPA in a private enforcement action and choosing to \n\u201cnot defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation\u201d); Ira Holtzman, \nC.P.A. v. Turza, 728 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir. 2013) \n(rejecting an FCC interpretation of the TCPA in a private \nenforcement action).  \nThat even split justified the Court\u2019s grant of certiorari \nof the question five years ago in PDR Network.   \n\n- 14 - \n \nB. Since then, the disagreement among the circuits has \nonly grown. Not only does the original split remain, but \nthe circuits have now taken different views on whether the \nHobbs Act extends even to FCC interpretative rules.   \nThe Fourth Circuit was the first to weigh in. On \nremand in PDR Network, the court focused on the first \n\u201cpreliminary issue[]\u201d flagged in this Court\u2019s opinion and \nheld that the FCC rule at issue in the case was \n\u201cinterpretive,\u201d rather than \u201clegislative.\u201d Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc. v. PDR Network, LLC, 982 F.3d 258, \n262\u201363 (4th Cir. 2020). And because interpretive rules \u201cdo \nnot have the force and effect of law and are not accorded \nthat weight in the adjudicatory process,\u201d the Fourth \nCircuit held that they therefore fall outside the scope of \nthe Hobbs Act and cannot bind district courts in private \nenforcement proceedings. Id. at 264 (holding that, because \nthe \u201cFCC Rule is interpretive,\u201d the \u201cdistrict court wasn\u2019t \nbound by it\u201d). \nSeveral other circuits have followed suit. For example, \nafter recognizing that this Court in PDR Network \n\u201csuggested that the FCC\u2019s interpretive rulings may not \nbind courts when they construe the TCPA,\u201d the Third \nCircuit refused to treat such rulings as binding authority. \nPanzarella v. Navient Sols., Inc., 37 F.4th 867, 873 n.7 (3d \nCir. 2022). The Second and Eighth Circuits have done the \nsame. See Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 End, Inc., 997 F.3d \n470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021) (finding the FCC\u2019s \ninterpretation \u201cpersuasive\u201d only after independently \ninterpreting the statutory text); Golan v. FreeEats.com, \nInc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019) (\u201cWe agree with \nthe FCC not because we believe we are bound to do so but \nbecause we find this portion of their interpretation of the \nstatute to be persuasive.\u201d). And the Seventh Circuit, for \n\n- 15 - \n \nits part, has held that it does not matter whether an FCC \norder \u201cis interpretive guidance or a legislative rule\u201d \nbecause, regardless, a court remains free to reject it when \n\u201cit conflicts with the statutory text\u201d of the TCPA. \nAmbassador Animal Hosp., Ltd. v. Elanco Animal \nHealth Inc., 74 F.4th 829, 832 (7th Cir. 2023).  \nBut the Ninth Circuit has taken the opposite view. It \nhas squarely rejected the argument that the Hobbs Act \n\u201cdoes not apply\u201d to FCC action that is \u201cinterpretive rather \nthan [] legislative,\u201d Hamilton, 224 F.3d at 1055. \u201cEven \nassuming that [an FCC order] is an interpretive rule,\u201d the \ncourt held, there is \u201cno support for the proposition that it \ntherefore falls outside the ambit of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \nInstead, according to the Ninth Circuit, because the \nHobbs Act \u201citself contains no exception for interpretive \nrules,\u201d it covers \u201cboth interpretive and legislative orders.\u201d \nId.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has adhered to that view ever \nsince\u2014even after PDR Network. In this very case, the \nNinth Circuit applied its binding circuit precedent and \ndetermined that the district court \u201ccorrectly found\u201d that it \nwas bound by an FCC interpretation even assuming it was \ninterpretive. It then denied an en banc call to boot. Pet. \nApp. 7a; see also Comcast of Or. II, Inc. v. City of \nBeaverton, 609 F. Supp. 3d 1136, 1150 (D. Or. 2022) \n(recognizing that, even after PDR Network, in the Ninth \nCircuit the Hobbs Act \u201capplies to final agency orders \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthey \nare \ninterpretive \nor \nlegislative\u201d).  \n\n- 16 - \n \nII. The Court has already recognized that this issue \nis worthy of review, and this case presents an \nideal vehicle. \nThe Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in PDR Network \ndemonstrates the importance of definitively resolving \nwhether the Hobbs Act requires federal district courts in \nprivate enforcement actions to categorically accept the \nFCC\u2019s legal interpretations of the TCPA. But although \ntwo preliminary issues interfered with that effort in PDR \nNetwork, the question\u2019s importance has not subsided. The \ndistrict court in this case recognized the need for \u201ccritical \nguidance\u201d on this issue, Pet. App. 20a, and judges\u2014even \nwithin circuits that have already weighed in\u2014have called \nfor a course correction in \u201cthe earliest appropriate case.\u201d \nGorss Motels, 931 F.3d at 1106 (Pryor, J., concurring). \nThis case presents the Court with just such an \nopportunity. The question is squarely teed up. And neither \nof the two preliminary issues that derailed resolution of \nthe question in PDR Network stands as an obstacle to \nreview in this case. This Court should take the opportunity \nand resolve this question once and for all. \nA. The question presented is important.   \nAs the growing circuit conflicts demonstrate, the need \nfor this Court\u2019s review has only intensified in the five \nyears since it granted certiorari in PDR Network. During \nthat short time, the Hobbs Act\u2019s applicability to FCC \ninterpretations of the TCPA has determined the outcome \nin numerous private enforcement actions. See, e.g., Tessu \nv. AdaptHealth, LLC, 2023 WL 5337121, at *5 (D. Md. \nAug, 17, 2023) (holding that the Hobbs Act bars any \nconsideration of a challenge to an FCC order in a private \nenforcement proceeding and noting that such an approach \nis consistent with \u201cthe majority of courts\u201d); Weister v. \n\n- 17 - \n \nVantage Point AI, LLC, 2022 WL 7026495, at *2 (M.D. \nFla. Oct. 12, 2022) (adhering to \u201cbinding circuit precedent\u201d \nthat \u201cthe Hobbs Act precludes a district court from \nconsidering a challenge to an FCC rule\u201d); Comcast of Or. \nII, 609 F. Supp. 3d at 1150 (refusing to \u201cspeculate as to \nhow the Supreme Court ultimately will resolve\u201d the \nquestion and holding that an FCC order is \u201cbinding on this \nCourt\u201d under the Hobbs Act).  \nRecognizing the importance of this issue, several \ncircuit judges have independently called for a definitive \nresolution of this issue. Last year, for instance, Judge \nPhipps lamented that the Third Circuit has repeatedly \n\u201cdeclined to resolve\u201d whether the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction\u201d provision bars a district court from \u201cany \nconsideration\u201d of the merits an FCC legal interpretation. \nRobert W. Mauthe MD PC v. Millenium Health LLC, 58 \nF.4th 93, 97\u201399 (3d Cir. 2023) (Phipps, J., concurring); see \nalso, e.g., Mauthe v. Nat\u2019l Imaging Assocs., Inc., 767 F. \nApp\u2019x 246, 250 n.5 (3d Cir. 2019) (\u201cIt is unclear if we must \nfollow the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u201d).   \nJudge William Pryor has likewise written separately \n\u201cto explain that [the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s] precedents\u201d\u2014\nwhich align with the Ninth Circuit precedent applied in \nthis case\u2014have \u201cmisconstrued\u201d the Hobbs Act\u2019s grant of \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction.\u201d Gorss Motels, 931 F.3d at 1106 \n(Pryor, J., concurring). As Judge Pryor recognized, an \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act that bars district courts \nfrom \u201cso much as considering any argument\u2014by any \nparty, in any case\u2014that an agency order misinterpreted \nthe law, no matter how wrong the agency\u2019s interpretation \nmight be,\u201d \u201cignores the statutory context, generates \nabsurd results, and raises serious constitutional doubts.\u201d \n\n- 18 - \n \nId. As a result, he urged that such a mistaken view should \nbe corrected \u201c[i]n the earliest appropriate case.\u201d Id.  \nThe harmful consequences of a rule depriving district \ncourts of the ability to even consider an argument that an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong is reason \nenough to grant review. But the lingering uncertainty for \nparties in other circuits that have not yet decided whether, \nand to what extent, the Hobbs Act applies is just as \nuntenable. In those jurisdictions, litigants are forced to \nguess whether their challenge to an FCC interpretation \nwill be categorically denied\u2014making their claims or \ndefenses unilaterally subject to whatever position the \nFCC has taken, no matter how wrong.   \nThe passage of time has also reinforced that further \npercolation would serve no purpose and only exacerbate \nthe harms caused by the present circuit conflict. Judge \nPryor\u2019s call for his own court to correct the mistake five \nyears ago has gone nowhere. And the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndenial of en banc review in this case shows that it, too, has \nlittle interest in reconsidering its position.  \nB. Neither of the two \u201cpreliminary issues\u201d \nidentified in PDR Network pose a barrier to \nanswering the question presented here. \nThis case is also a good vehicle. For starters, the facts \nof the case squarely present the core question. As the \ndistrict court explained, treating the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors \norder as authoritative\u2014which it was required to do under \ncontrolling Ninth Circuit caselaw\u2014was \u201cdeterminative of \nthe viability of this case.\u201d Pet. App. 20a. After holding that \nit was bound by the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order, the district \ncourt decertified the class and sua sponte granted \nsummary judgment to McKesson. Pet. App. 20a, 22a. And \nwhen the Ninth Circuit affirmed, it explicitly held that the \n\n- 19 - \n \ndistrict court had \u201ccorrectly found that it was bound by \nthe [FCC\u2019s] Amerifactors declaratory ruling.\u201d Pet. App. \n7a.  \nBeyond that, neither of the two \u201cpreliminary issues\u201d \nthat this Court identified in PDR Network stands as an \nobstacle to reaching the question presented here.   \nStart with the possibility that the FCC order is \u201cthe \nequivalent of an interpretive rule\u201d and so \u201cmay not be \nbinding on a district court.\u201d PDR Network, 139 S. Ct. at \n2055. In the Ninth Circuit, that distinction is irrelevant: \nBoth legislative and interpretive rules are binding on a \ndistrict court. Hamilton, 224 F.3d at 1055. That is why, \nwhen the district court here explicitly considered this \nquestion, it recognized that any \u201cpotential distinction \nbetween legislative and interpretive rules does not \nmatter.\u201d Pet. App. 37a. It therefore held that, \u201c[e]ven \nassuming\u201d that the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order was merely \ninterpretive, a district court was still bound to follow it. Id. \nSo, in stark contrast to PDR Network, where the lower \ncourt had not addressed the issue, there would be no basis \nto vacate and remand for consideration of this issue here. \nNor is the prior adequacy of Hobbs Act review under \nsection 703 of the APA an impediment to review here. In \nPDR Network, the petitioner argued in its merits brief to \nthis Court that it did not have a prior or adequate \nopportunity under the Hobbs Act to challenge the FCC\u2019s \norder. Brief for Petitioners at 15\u201316, PDR Network, LLC \nv. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc. (No. 17-705) (Jan. \n8, 2019). That argument had potential merit because the \nrelevant FCC order was issued years before the petitioner \nwas sued for violating the TCPA. And if the argument \nwere correct, as this Court noted in its opinion, \u201cit may be\u201d \nthat section 703 would \u201cpermit[]\u201d a \u201cchallenge [to] the \n\n- 20 - \n \nvalidity of the Order in th[e] enforcement proceeding.\u201d 139 \nS. Ct at 2056. But that question is not present in this case. \nThe petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \u201cprior\u201d \nor \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct. So the only relevant question that was before the \ncourt of appeals is the question that is squarely presented \nby the petition: whether the Hobbs Act required the \ndistrict court to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the \nTCPA, regardless of whether the FCC\u2019s interpretation is \ncorrect. And, in any event, unlike the order at issue in \nPDR Network, which raised adequate-notice concerns, \nthe relevant order in this case was issued six years after \nthis case was filed, and while it was still pending.  \n* \n* \n* \nThe lower courts are no less divided over the question \npresented now than they were when this Court granted \nreview in PDR Network. If anything, the more recent \ncases just reinforce the need for this Court\u2019s guidance. By \ngranting review here, this Court can provide much-needed \nclarity on whether the Hobbs Act requires district court \nto accept an FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA even \nin run-of-the-mill private enforcement actions.  \nIII. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule that, under the Hobbs \nAct, a district court in a private enforcement \nproceeding is bound by an FCC interpretation of \nthe TCPA is wrong. \nThe Court should grant certiorari for an additional \nreason: As Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR \nNetwork makes clear, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \nthe Hobbs Act is wrong. The Act\u2019s grant of exclusive \njurisdiction means that a district court may not entertain \na petition for review of an FCC order subject to the Act. \nBut it does not mandate that a district court must follow \n\n- 21 - \n \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA every time a case \nwithin its jurisdiction presents a question of federal law \nthat the agency has addressed in an order. Such a rule \nignores the plain meaning of the statutory text, leads to \nabsurd results, and raises serious constitutional concerns. \nAnd even if the Hobbs Act mandated this result for those \nlegislative rules that have the force and effect of law, the \nNinth Circuit is wrong that the Act applies as well even to \nan agency\u2019s interpretive guidance documents.   \nA. The analysis begins with the text of the Hobbs Act. \nIt says that the circuit courts have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d \n\u201cto enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to \ndetermine the validity of\u201d certain agency orders. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2342. This grant of exclusive jurisdiction \u201cforce[s] \nparties who want to challenge agency orders via facial, \npre-enforcement challenges to do so promptly and to do so \nin a court of appeals.\u201d PDR Network, 139 S. Ct. at 2059 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). And the statute\u2019s reference \nto the authority to \u201cenjoin, set aside, suspend,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d an order \u201caffords the court of \nappeals exclusive jurisdiction to issue an injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment regarding the agency\u2019s order.\u201d Id. \nat 2063 (noting that the relevant question \u201cis \u2018exclusive \njurisdiction\u2019 to do what?\u201d and that \u201cif a district court in an \nenforcement \naction \ndisagrees \nwith \nthe \nagency \ninterpretation, the district court does not issue a \ndeclaratory judgment or an injunction against the \nagency\u201d). \nBut just as significant is what the Hobbs Act doesn\u2019t \nsay. As Justice Kavanaugh explained, Congress has \nenacted several statutes designed to channel both facial, \ndirect-review challenges of agency orders, along with as-\napplied enforcement actions, exclusively to the courts of \n\n- 22 - \n \nappeals. See id. at 2062 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) \n(noting prominent examples that include the Clean Water \nAct, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act). In addition to \nusing similar language providing for facial, pre-\nenforcement review of certain agency orders in a court of \nappeals, these statutes all say something like agency \norders \u201cshall not be subject to judicial review in any civil \nor criminal proceeding for enforcement.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting the \nClean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)). The Hobbs Act, by \ncontrast, contains no similar prescription. \u201cThe fact that \nCongress has expressly precluded judicial review\u201d in \nsimilar statutes \u201csuggests that Congress\u2019 silence in the \nHobbs Act should not be read to preclude judicial review.\u201d \nId. at 2061.  \nB. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s view also leads to absurd \nresults. If correct, it would mean that a plaintiff with a \nviable claim under the TCPA\u2014a federal law enacted by \nCongress\u2014would be unable to pursue it based solely on \nthe fact that the FCC has misinterpreted the statute in an \norder to which the plaintiff was not a party. And a \ndefendant haled into court to defend against a claim that \nit violated the TCPA would likewise be disabled from even \narguing that an FCC order being enforced against it was \nwrong. Under such an interpretation, \u201cthe Hobbs Act \nestops vast numbers\u201d of parties who \u201cmight wish to \nadvance a view of the law different from that of the \nagency.\u201d Gorss Motels, 931 F.3d at 1110 (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But \u201c[r]equiring all those potentially affected \nparties to bring a facial, pre-enforcement challenge within \n60 days or otherwise forfeit their right to challenge an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute borders on the \nabsurd.\u201d PDR Network, 139 S. Ct. at 2061\u201362 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (noting that such a \n\n- 23 - \n \nrequirement would be \u201cwholly impractical\u201d and \u201ca huge \nwaste of resources\u201d).   \nC. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s understanding also raises \nserious constitutional concerns. If a district court \u201ccould \nnever second-guess agency interpretations in orders \nsubject to the Hobbs Act,\u201d Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1110\u201311, \nthen the Hobbs Act likely intrudes \u201cupon Article III\u2019s \nvesting of the \u2018judicial Power\u2019 in the courts.\u201d PDR \nNetwork, 139 S. Ct. at 2057 (Thomas, J., concurring). As \nJustice Thomas explained in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, the judicial power \u201cas originally understood\u201d \nrequires a court to \u201cexercise its independent judgment in \ninterpreting and expounding upon the laws,\u201d and that \nduty \u201cnecessarily entails identifying and applying [] \ngoverning law.\u201d Id. Of course, in the appropriate \ncircumstance, a court must sometimes defer to agency \ninterpretations of statutes, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Hobbs-\nAct interpretation transforms deference into something \nelse entirely\u2014\u201cabdication\u201d of the judicial power to \ndetermine what law governs a case. Id. at 2066 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (noting that, under such an \ninterpretation, a district court \u201cwould have to afford the \nagency not mere Skidmore deference or Chevron \ndeference, but absolute deference\u201d).  \nAt a minimum, even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act is plausible, the \nconstitutional-doubt canon should compel an alternative \nreading of the Act that avoids these constitutional \nconcerns. See Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1106 (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). And as Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence has \nrecognized, that alternative reading\u2014which recognizes \nthat \ndistrict \ncourts \nadjudicating \ngarden-variety \n\n- 24 - \n \nenforcement actions are not required to treat FCC orders \nas binding\u2014is not just plausible, but compelling. \nD. Finally, even if the Ninth Circuit is correct that the \nHobbs Act\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d language precludes \nas-applied judicial review of an agency\u2019s legislative rules \nin an enforcement proceeding, it cannot be the case that \nthe same is true for an agency\u2019s interpretive guidance. As \nthis Court has explained, legislative rules are typically \nissued through the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment process \nand, as a result, have the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d Perez \nv. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96\u201397 (2015). But \ninterpretive rules are those that an agency issues without \nfollowing the formal notice-and-comment process\u2014\nincluding those that are \u201cissued by an agency to advise the \npublic of the agency\u2019s construction of the statutes and \nrules which it administers.\u201d Id. That convenience, \nhowever, \u201ccomes at a price: Interpretive rules do not have \nthe force and effect of law and are not accorded that \nweight in the adjudicatory process.\u201d PDR Network, 982 \nF.3d at 263\u201364. So, as even the United States has \nacknowledged, because courts are not required to give \neffect to interpretive rules, they are not binding on a \ndistrict court under the Hobbs Act. See id. (noting the \ngovernment\u2019s agreement on remand in PDR Network \nthat, because \u201cthe relevant portions of the 2006 FCC Rule \nare interpretive, rather than legislative,\u201d \u201cthe district \ncourt was not bound to follow it\u201d). Against this \n\u201cconsensus\u201d view, only the Ninth Circuit disagrees.

I now recognize that the core of this case is not about the underlying TCPA violation (unsolicited faxes) but is a question of administrative and procedural law.\n\nThe central legal question presented to the Supreme Court is: **Does the Hobbs Act require a federal district court to accept the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC) legal interpretation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)?**\n\nThis reframes the problem. The key conflict is between two legal frameworks:\n1.  **The Hobbs Act:** This statute provides a specific and exclusive pathway for challenging agency orders, typically requiring a direct appeal to a court of appeals within a set timeframe.\n2.  **Private Right of Action under the TCPA:** This allows individuals or entities (like the plaintiffs here) to sue for violations in federal district court.\n\nThe tension arises when a defendant in a TCPA lawsuit (like McKesson) wants to challenge an underlying FCC interpretation that is unfavorable to them. The Ninth Circuit's ruling, which the Supreme Court is being asked to review, implies that because McKesson did not challenge the FCC's interpretation through the Hobbs Act's exclusive review process, the district court is bound to accept that interpretation as law.\n\nMy understanding is now focused on this jurisdictional and procedural issue. To predict the outcome, I must investigate precedents concerning the exclusivity of the Hobbs Act, the nature of the specific FCC interpretation at issue, and whether that interpretation qualifies as an \"order\" that triggers the Hobbs Act's review requirements. My next step will be to analyze the petitioner's arguments in the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to understand why they believe the lower court's application of the Hobbs Act was incorrect.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be that the central legal question is whether the Hobbs Act compels a federal district court to accept the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC) legal interpretations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) as binding. My prior belief was that this created a jurisdictional tension between the Hobbs Act's exclusive review process in the courts of appeals and the TCPA's private right of action in district courts.\n\nThe new observation, the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, has substantially deepened my understanding by providing the petitioner's specific legal arguments and strategic framing.\n\nMy beliefs have been updated and refined as follows:\n\n*   **Central Precedent Identified:** The petitioner's entire case is framed in relation to a key Supreme Court case: ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.***, 139 S. Ct. 2051 (2019). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on this exact same question in that case but ultimately remanded without a decision.\n\n*   **Rationale for *PDR Network*'s Remand:** I now understand *why* the Court did not resolve the issue in *PDR Network*. The majority identified two \"preliminary issues\" that had not been addressed by the lower court, making it difficult to reach the main question:\n    1.  Whether the FCC order was an \"interpretive rule\" versus a \"legislative rule,\" as interpretive rules might not be subject to the Hobbs Act's exclusive review provisions.\n    2.  Whether the petitioner lacked a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity for judicial review under the Hobbs Act, which might permit a challenge in a later enforcement action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\n*   **Petitioner's \"Ideal Vehicle\" Argument:** The petitioner's core strategy is to present this case as the \"ideal vehicle\" to finally resolve the question left open in *PDR Network*. They argue that neither of the two preliminary issues is a barrier here:\n    1.  The interpretive/legislative rule distinction is irrelevant because controlling Ninth Circuit precedent (*U.S. West Commc'ns, Inc. v. Hamilton*) holds that the Hobbs Act applies to *both* types of rules. The lower court has already spoken on this.\n    2.  The \"adequate opportunity for review\" issue is not present because the petitioner never argued that it lacked such an opportunity. The case was decided purely on the binding effect of the Hobbs Act.\n\n*   **The Specific FCC Interpretation:** The FCC rule at the heart of this dispute is the 2019 ***Amerifactors*** **declaratory ruling**. This ruling interpreted the TCPA's definition of \"telephone facsimile machine\" to *exclude* online fax services. Because the district court felt bound by this ruling, it was forced to decertify the class and grant summary judgment against claims involving those services.\n\n*   **Signal from Justice Kavanaugh's Concurrence:** A crucial piece of evidence is the petitioner's heavy reliance on Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network* (joined by three other justices). This concurrence would have decided the question, arguing that the Hobbs Act is \"silent about review in subsequent enforcement actions.\" Unlike statutes like the Clean Water Act which have express preclusion clauses, the Hobbs Act does not. Therefore, the \"general rule of administrative law\" should apply, allowing a defendant in a district court enforcement action to argue that the agency's interpretation is wrong. The district court in this case even explicitly stated it \"agree[d] with the reasoning of Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence\" but was bound by circuit precedent. This provides a strong signal that at least four justices may be inclined to rule for the petitioner.\n\nMy predictive model is now much more specific. Instead of just weighing the Hobbs Act vs. the TCPA, I must now weigh the likelihood that the current Court will adopt the reasoning laid out in Justice Kavanaugh's *PDR Network* concurrence, especially given a case that appears to be procedurally \"cleaner\" than *PDR Network* was. The petitioner has clearly laid out a roadmap for the Court to adopt that reasoning and reverse the Ninth Circuit.",

The brief could reveal procedural flaws that undermine the petitioner's 'ideal vehicle' narrative, which would drastically alter my prediction. Alternatively, it could focus on the merits, allowing me to build a much more robust model of the legal arguments the Court will weigh. Therefore, the Task EIG is near-maximal. For Design EIG, this action is a textbook example of a crucial strategy: after absorbing one party's framing (from the petition), immediately seek the opposing viewpoint to de-bias and complete the information landscape.

It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).  Plaintiffs may seek actual damages or \n$500 in statutory damages \u201cfor each such violation.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 227(b)(3)(B).  \n\n5\n2. \nFCC authority and judicial review\nCongress authorized the FCC to \u201cprescribe regula-\ntions to implement the requirements\u201d of the TCPA.  Id. \n\u00a7 227(b)(2).  Like other agencies, the FCC also has adju-\ndicatory authority to \u201cissue a declaratory order\u201d to \u201cter-\nminate a controversy or remove uncertainty\u201d in the laws \nit administers.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).\nThis case involves a declaratory order issued by an FCC \ncomponent on delegated authority.  Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

But unless and until \nreversed by the FCC, any \u201caction made or taken pursu-\nant to any such delegation * * * shall have the same force \nand effect, and shall be made, evidenced, and enforced in \nthe same manner, as orders, decisions, reports, or other \nactions of the Commission.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 155(c)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1.102(b)(1); 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.102(b)(3) (absent a stay from \nWKH\u0003)&&\u000f\u0003\u00c0OLQJ\u0003DQ\u0003DSSOLFDWLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003UHYLHZ\u0003GRHV\u0003QRW\u0003OLPLW\u0003WKH\u0003\neffectiveness of an action taken on delegated authority).\nA decision by the full FCC is a \u201ccondition precedent to \njudicial review\u201d of any action taken by an FCC component \non delegated authority.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).

(footnote omitted).\nActing on delegated authority, the FCC\u2019s Consumer \nand Governmental Affairs Bureau decided the petition \nafter notice and comment.  Pet. App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 48a (citing Rules & Reguls. Implementing \nthe Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, \n14133 \u00b6200 (2003)).\nThe Bureau\u2019s plain reading of the text was reinforced \nby the TCPA\u2019s purposes.

KIM\nMORRISON & FOERSTER LLP\n755 Page Mill Road\nPalo Alto, CA 94304\nCounsel for Respondents McKesson Corporation \nand McKesson Technologies, Inc.\nAUGUST 5, 2024\n\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nIn 2019, a Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) bureau issued a declaratory order clarifying \nthat online fax services, whose users essentially receive \nfaxes as email attachments, are not \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine[s]\u201d under the Telephone Consumer Protection \nAct (TCPA).  It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.  In 2018, McKesson \nTechnologies LLC was acquired by Change Healthcare. \nAs part of the sale agreement, McKesson Corporation \nretained responsibility for McKesson Technologies LLC\u2019s \nobligations related to this suit.  McKesson Corporation \ncurrently has no ownership or direct or indirect voting \ninterest in either Change Healthcare or McKesson \nTechnologies LLC.\n\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTION PRESENTED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi\nINTRODUCTION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\nSTATEMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\nA.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Id. \n\u00a7 227(b)(2).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 48a (citing Rules & Reguls. Implementing \nthe Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, \n14133 \u00b6200 (2003)).\nThe Bureau\u2019s plain reading of the text was reinforced \nby the TCPA\u2019s purposes.

There is no such split, \nand, even if there were, it would not be presented here.\nAs petitioner notes, before PDR Network, the Ninth \nCircuit held that the Hobbs Act applies to interpretive \nas well as legislative rules.

The Ninth Circuit \ndid not characterize Amerifactors as an interpretive \nrule\u2014or any rule at all.  Instead, the court treated the \nAmerifactors order as an adjudication.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIt noted that the FCC Bureau had acted pursuant to 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).  Pet. App. 9a.  That provision authorizes \nthe Bureau to \u201cissue a declaratory ruling terminating a \ncontroversy or removing uncertainty.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a). \nThe court further observed that the APA characterizes \ndeclaratory rulings as adjudications.  Pet. App. 9a (citing \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e)); see Central Texas Tel. Co-op., Inc. v. \nFCC, 402 F.3d 205, 210 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (FCC declaratory \norder proceedings are adjudications).

Here, as the Ninth Circuit held \n(Pet. App. 9a), the FCC proceeded through adjudication.\nPetitioner cites no post-PDR Network court of appeals \ndecision accepting a collateral attack on an FCC adjudica-\ntive ruling, much less a split on that question.  Nor could \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision here be part of any such \nsplit, given that it is non-precedential (and does not even \ncite PDR Network).  \nB. Regardless, Revisiting The Hobbs Act Question \nWould Be Premature\nAlthough PDR Network did not resolve the question \npresented there, the Court\u2014in both the majority opinion \nand Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence\u2014provided guid-\nance for lower courts about what factors may be relevant \nand how to approach the Hobbs Act question.  Given the \nrecency of that decision and the relatively small number \nof cases that present the question, the courts of appeals \nhave just begun to react to and apply that guidance.  Cer-\nWLRUDUL\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003SUHPDWXUH\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003JLYLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXUWV\u0003\nof appeals an opportunity to fully consider PDR Network.\nThe cases petitioner cites for its supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split illustrate this prematurity.  Three of those \ncases make passing references to PDR Network only \nin a footnote.  Panzarella v. Navient Sol., Inc., 37 F.4th \n867, 873 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022); Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 \nEnd, Inc., 997 F.3d 470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021); Golan v. \nFreeEats.com, Inc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019). \nIt is unsurprising that these courts did not meaningfully \nengage with the Hobbs Act question or the guidance in \n\n16\nPDR Network because the issue would not have been \noutcome-determinative in any of those cases.  All three \ncourts agreed with the FCC\u2019s interpretation, so it did not \nmatter whether they were bound by it.  See, e.g., Golan, \n930 F.3d at 960 n.8 (\u201cOur decision is not implicated by the \nrecent Supreme Court opinion in PDR Network.\u201d).  In fact, \nfar from adopting the rule petitioner claims, the Second \nCircuit expressly stated that the status of FCC orders \nremained \u201can open question\u201d and that it \u201cneed not decide \nthat question here.\u201d  Gorss Motels, 997 F.3d at 477 n.4.\nIf the Court wants to revisit PDR Network, it should \nat least wait for the courts of appeals to digest and act on \nits prior guidance, so it can reconsider the question with \nWKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003WKRVH\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003GHFLVLRQV\u0011\u0003\u0003\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 DECISION WAS \nCORRECT\nThe court of appeals correctly held that a plaintiff \nin a TCPA case cannot impose liability on a defendant \nbased on a reading of the statute the FCC has rejected \nin still-pending proceedings.

The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held Petitioner \nCould Not Collaterally Attack The FCC Bureau\u2019s \nOrder\n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the district \ncourt \u201cwas bound by the Federal Communication Commis-\nsion\u2019s Amerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined \nthat the TCPA does not apply to faxes received through \n\n17\nan online fax service.\u201d  Pet.

To \u201cdeter-\nmine the validity\u201d of an agency order is to \u201csettle a ques-\ntion or controversy about\u201d whether it is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d \nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 711 (2d ed. 1958) (determine); id. at 2813 (valid). \n7KDW\u0003EURDG\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003LQFOXGHV\u0003FROODWHUDO\u0003DWWDFNV\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003 \norder that require a court to determine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nwhen, as here, an FCC component issues an order on \ndelegated authority, the full FCC\u2019s resolution of an appli-\ncation for review of the order is a \u201ccondition precedent to \njudicial review.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).\nCongress thus laid down one exclusive path for courts \nto determine whether Amerifactors correctly interpreted \nWKH\u00037&3$\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003VWRS\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003D\u0003GHFLVLRQ\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003IXOO\u0003\nFCC on the pending application for review.  The second \nwould be review by a court of appeals on a petition for \nreview under the Hobbs Act.  A plaintiff whose claims \ndepend on a determination that the FCC\u2019s interpretation \nof the statute is wrong may not circumvent that exclusive \npath by inviting a district court to make its own deter-\nmination.\n2. In support of petitioner\u2019s position on the merits, it \nrepeatedly invokes PDR Network and Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s \nopinion concurring in the judgment.  E.g., Pet. 1, 2, 20.  But \nit fails to acknowledge that case\u2019s fundamental difference. \nThere, a TCPA defendant argued that, notwithstand-\ning the Hobbs Act, it had a right to defend itself from \nliability under an erroneous interpretation of a statute. \n\n18\nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 6.  Here, by contrast, the agency \nentrusted by Congress to interpret and enforce the TCPA \nhas said that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is correct.  It \nis the TCPA plaintiff that seeks to circumvent Hobbs Act \nreview of that determination to expand the defendants\u2019 \nliability.\n7KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003OLQH\u0003RI\u0003-XVWLFH\u0003.DYDQDXJK\u00b7V\u0003VHSDUDWH\u0003RSLQLRQ\u0003\nLGHQWL\u00c0HG\u0003WKH\u0003LVVXH\u0003KH\u0003ZDV\u0003DGGUHVVLQJ\u001d\u0003\u0003\u00b40D\\\u0003defendants in \ncivil enforcement actions under the Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act contest the Federal Communications Com-\nmission\u2019s interpretation of the Act?\u201d  Id. at 10-11 (empha-\nsis added).  And his opinion repeatedly emphasized the \ndefendant-centered question before the Court.  See, e.g., \nid. at 12 (\u201cI would conclude that the Hobbs Act does not \nbar a defendant in an enforcement action from arguing \nthat the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d); \nid. at 12 (\u201cThe general rule of administrative law is that \nin an enforcement action, a defendant may argue that \nan agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong, at least \nunless Congress has expressly precluded the defendant \nfrom advancing such an argument.\u201d); id. at 14 (\u201cThe ques-\ntion for us is whether the Hobbs Act bars defendants in \nthose enforcement actions from arguing that the agency \nincorrectly interpreted the statute.

That background principle formed the \nbasis of the \u201cdefault rule\u201d that he applied to statutes he \ncategorized as \u201csilent about review in subsequent enforce-\nment actions\u201d:  \u201cIn those enforcement actions, the defen-\ndant may argue that the agency\u2019s interpretation is wrong.\u201d \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 15.  But neither he nor the PDR \nNetwork majority cited any such principle under which a \nplaintiff in such an enforcement action may do the same. \nJustice Kavanaugh\u2019s emphasis on defendants\u2019 rights \nalso implicated a \u201cconstitutional issue\u201d:  \u201cBarring defen-\ndants in as-applied enforcement actions from raising \narguments about the reach and authority of agency rules \nHQIRUFHG\u0003DJDLQVW\u0003WKHP\u0003UDLVHV\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHVWLRQV\u0003XQGHU\u0003\nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.  He explained that this \nconstitutional concern counseled in favor of \u201cthe default \nrule\u201d allowing defendants to make such arguments.  Ibid.\n\n20\nIn contrast, allowing plaintiffs to challenge an agen-\ncy\u2019s interpretation that limits liability for defendants \nwould disrupt the statutory scheme.  Congress provided \nfor both FCC and private enforcement of the TCPA.  See \nMims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n374 n.4 (2012) (noting that FCC may initiate civil actions \nand impose forfeitures for violations of the statute and \nits regulations).  In such FCC enforcement actions, the \nagency would not be permitted to impose liability based \non an interpretation of the statute the agency had ex-\npressly rejected. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n567 U.S. 239, 253-254 (2012) (penalizing regulated entity \nfor non-compliance with new, more expansive interpreta-\ntion of prohibited conduct violates due process).  It makes \nsense that an enforcement action brought by a private \nindividual would be subject to the same limitation.5\nB. The TCPA Does Not Prohibit Fax Advertisements \nSent To Online Fax Services\nWhether or not Amerifactors is binding, it is correct. \nAs the Fourth Circuit recently held, the TCPA\u2019s plain \n5.  Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), \ncasts no doubt on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding.  Loper Bright \ninvolved the standard that courts apply when reviewing an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute\u2014not which court is the proper \none to conduct such review.  Loper Bright held that \u201ccourts need \nnot and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of \nthe law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d  Id. at 2273.  Should \nthe full FCC decide the Amerifactors application for review and \nshould a party challenge that decision in a court of appeals under \nthe Hobbs Act, Loper Bright will control that court\u2019s review.  This \ncase involves the different question of whether a TCPA plaintiff \ncan circumvent the Hobbs Act by effectively seeking such review \nin a district court.\n\n21\nlanguage shows that Congress did not extend the statu-\ntory prohibition to advertisements sent to online fax \nservices.

THIS CASE IS A POOR VEHICLE FOR \nRESOLVING THE QUESTION PRESENTED\nPetitioner pitches this case as the \u201cideal vehicle to \nresolve the question presented, but left undecided, in \nPDR Network.\u201d  Pet. 2.  But this case is different from \nPDR Network for multiple reasons, and each one poses a \nVLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003SUREOHP\u0011\u0003\u0003,I\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003ZDQWV\u0003WR\u0003UHYLVLW\u0003\nthe question presented in PDR Network, it should wait \nfor another case to do so. \nA. The Due Process Concerns Present In PDR \nNetwork Are Absent Here\nAs noted above, there is a fundamental differ-\nence between PDR Network and this case.  See supra \npp. 17-20.  In PDR Network, the plaintiff invoked a favor-\nable FCC order and argued the defendant could not chal-\nlenge it.  This case presents the opposite situation.  It is \nthe defendants who invoke a favorable FCC order and \nargue it is binding.\nThat difference means that the reasoning and con-\ncerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence \nin PDR Network are inapplicable here.  PDR Network \nimplicated the traditional principle that a defendant can \ntypically defend itself in an enforcement action by con-\ntending that a regulation is invalid.  To hold otherwise, \nJustice Kavanaugh wrote, would raise serious due process \nconcerns.  See supra pp. 19-20.  Petitioner points to no \ncomparable traditional principle that allows plaintiffs to \nattack an agency determination to expand the scope of \ndefendants\u2019 liability.  Limiting plaintiffs\u2019 ability to do so \nimplicates none of the due process concerns Justice Ka-\nvanaugh expressed.\n\n28\nTo answer the question that was presented in PDR \nNetwork, the Court should await a case where the plain-\ntiff invokes the Hobbs Act to prevent a defendant from \nchallenging an FCC order that the defendant contends \nexpands its liability beyond what the statute allows.\nB. The FCC Proceeding At Issue Is Ongoing \nThe FCC order here was issued by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau on delegated \nauthority.  Pet. App. 57a.  An application for review of that \norder remains pending with the full FCC.  Pet. App. 8a \nn.1.  When the FCC decides that application for review, its \ndecision will then be reviewable under the Hobbs Act in a \ncourt of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).\nThe ongoing FCC proceedings make this case differ-\nent from PDR Network, where the relevant FCC order \n(by the full Commission) had issued many years before \nthe relevant private-party litigation.  588 U.S. at 3.  The \nprovisional nature of the FCC order here poses several \nproblems for review.\n1. \nA decision by the FCC while this case \nis pending could prevent the Court from \nreaching the question presented\nBecause FCC proceedings are ongoing, the Commis-\nsion could decide the pending application for review before \nthis Court issued its decision on the merits.  And which-\never side lost before the full Commission could then seek \nHobbs Act review of that decision in a court of appeals.\n\n29\nThe outcome of those further administrative (and \npossibly judicial) proceedings could fundamentally change \nthe nature of this case and hinder this Court\u2019s ability to \nanswer the question presented.  For example, it is not \nclear what would happen if the full Commission were to \ngrant the application for review and reverse the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order.  Under those circumstances, the FCC \norder on which respondents and the court of appeals relied \nwould no longer be in force, but a new order favoring \npetitioner would be.  \nOr if a court of appeals sets aside the full FCC\u2019s order \nduring the pendency of this case in this Court, there \nwould then be no FCC order at issue.  And a different \nquestion\u2014decided by the Ninth Circuit in an appeal ear-\nlier in this case\u2014could be presented:  is the decision of a \nHobbs Act court setting aside an FCC order binding on \nanother court deciding a dispute between private parties? \nSee True Health Chiropractic, 896 F.3d at 930 (answering \nyes); accord Gorss Motels, Inc. v. FCC, 20 F.4th 87, 96 (2d \nCir. 2021); Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. ASD Specialty \nHealthcare, Inc., 863 F.3d 460, 467-468 (6th Cir. 2017).\nThese and other scenarios made possible by Ameri-\nfactors\u2019 pendency greatly increase the risk of a dismissal \nRI\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003LPSURYLGHQWO\\\u0003JUDQWHG\u000f\u0003D\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003RI\u0003\nmootness, or a remand to the Ninth Circuit based solely \non Amerifactors-related developments.  Any of those out-\ncomes would prevent the Court from reaching the question \npresented.  This risk can be eliminated if the Court waits \nto revisit the PDR Network question in a case in which \nthe FCC order was issued by the full Commission and is \nno longer subject to judicial review.\n\n30\n2. \nStrategic decisions by petitioner and its \ncounsel in the FCC proceedings could \npreclude challenging the FCC\u2019s order, \nindependent of the Hobbs Act \nPetitioner made a strategic choice not to participate \nin the administrative proceeding whose (interim) outcome \nit now complains about.  But its attorneys in their own \nnames are participating in a related FCC proceeding pre-\nsenting the same question.  See supra pp. 8-9 (discussing \nRyerson).  Both those circumstances distinguish this case \nfrom PDR Network and render it an unappealing vehicle \nfor consideration of the question presented.\nIn PDR Network, the relevant FCC decision came \nseven years before the fax advertisements at issue.  588 \nU.S. at 3.  This Court noted that the APA \u201cprovides that \n\u2018agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement\u2019 except \u2018to \nthe extent that [a] prior, adequate, and exclusive oppor-\ntunity for judicial review is provided by law.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 7 \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703) (emphasis by Court).

In PDR Network, \nJustice Kavanaugh noted that a party that \u201cchallenges \n6.

To be sure, petitioner here has not par-\nticipated in Ryerson.  But its counsel has\u2014not on behalf \nof some other client, but in counsel\u2019s own name.  And it did \nso for a stated representational reason:   counsel advised \nthe FCC that it \u201crepresents clients across the country in \nprivate litigation\u201d in TCPA cases and that the FCC\u2019s deci-\nsion could impact them.

And all of counsel\u2019s Ryerson\u0003\u00c0OLQJV\u0003RFFXUUHG\u0003\nconcurrently with the district court litigation here; indeed, \nFRXQVHO\u0003\u00c0OHG\u0003LWV\u0003Ryerson application for review arguing \nthat Amerifactors was wrongly decided while respondents\u2019 \nmotion to decertify the class based on Amerifactors was \npending.  See supra pp. 8-9.\nA prior decision can be the basis for issue preclusion \neven as to non-parties in a variety of circumstances, \nincluding when there is a \u201cpre-existing substantive legal \nrelationship between the person to be bound and a party \nto the judgment\u201d and where the nonparty was \u201cadequately \nrepresented by someone with the same interests who \nwas a party.\u201d  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 894 (2008) \n(quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Here, counsel \nand petitioner had a preexisting legal relationship and \ncounsel adequately represented petitioner\u2019s interests \nas to the online-fax-service issue when it participated in \nRyerson.  It is thus possible that normal preclusion prin-\nciples would bind petitioner to the result in Ryerson.  See \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring); cf. Ferris v. Cuevas, 118 F.3d 122, 127, 130 (2d Cir. \n\u0014\u001c\u001c\u001a\f\u0003\u000bDSSO\\LQJ\u00031HZ\u0003<RUN\u0003ODZ\u0003DQG\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003UHV\u0003MXGLFDWD\u0003EDU\u0003\nbecause, among other reasons, attorneys in second case \nKDG\u0003DSSHDUHG\u0003LQ\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003FDVH\u0003LQ\u0003WKHLU\u0003RZQ\u0003QDPHV\f\u0011\n\n33\nAt the very least, both of these issues would likely \ncomplicate the Court\u2019s review of the Hobbs Act question.7\nC. There Is A Mismatch Between The Question \nPresented And The Decision Below\nPetitioner\u2019s principal argument in the district court \nand court of appeals was that Amerifactors was not binding \nunder the Hobbs Act because it was a bureau-level deci-\nsion.  Pet. CA Principal & Resp. Br. 30-33.  It limited the \nbroader argument it now makes to a footnote in its merits \nbrief and to its rehearing petition.  Pet. CA Principal & \nResp. Br. 32 n.4; Pet. CA Reh\u2019g Pet.  This would impede the \nCourt\u2019s review of the question now presented in two ways.\nFirst, as a result of how petitioner briefed the case \nbelow, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s unpublished memorandum did \nnot engage on the broader question or even cite PDR \nNetwork.  Instead, it addressed only the argument it \nunderstood petitioner to be making\u2014that the Bureau\u2019s \nRUGHU\u0003ZDV\u0003QRW\u0003D\u0003\u00b4\u00c0QDO\u0003RUGHU\u00b5\u0003IRU\u0003SXUSRVHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003+REEV\u0003\nAct.  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet petitioner does not seek review of \nthat question, so there is a mismatch between the deci-\nsion below and the question petitioner wants this Court to \nGHFLGH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003GHQLHV\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003WKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003\ndecision to review that addresses the question in light \nof PDR Network.  The Court generally does not grant \ncertiorari in that situation.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 \nU.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not \nRI\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003YLHZ\u0011\u00b5\f\u0011\n7.  Respondents had no reason to raise these complications \nbelow because petitioner did not make the argument it is pressing \nhere, and no decision has yet triggered preclusion.  See infra Part \nIII.C.\n\n34\nSecond, petitioner nowhere disclaims the argument it \nmade to the court of appeals.  If petitioner\u2019s merits brief \nwere to revive that argument involving the bureau-level \nnature of the FCC order, the case could end up focused on \nthat idiosyncrasy.  Again, this possibility for distraction \nmakes this a poor vehicle for review.\n'\u0011\u0003 $Q\u0003$OWHUQDWLYH\u0003*URXQG\u0003)RU\u0003$I\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003%DVHG\u0003\nOn The Plain Statutory Text Makes This A \nPoor Vehicle\n$Q\u0003REYLRXV\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u00b3WKH\u0003\nFCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute is plainly correct as a \nde novo matter\u2014could prevent the Court from deciding \nthe question presented.  \nAs discussed above, respondents have argued all \nalong that the statute plainly does not cover online fax \nservices, and they would make that argument again as \nDQ\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003LI\u0003FHUWLRUDUL\u0003ZHUH\u0003\ngranted.

Petitioner argued below that the Sixth Circuit in Lyngaas \nv. Ag, 992 F.3d 412 (2021), supports its statutory argument that \nthe TCPA applies to online fax services.  But as the Fourth Circuit \nhas explained, that is incorrect.

The district \ncourt there found Amerifactors binding under the Hobbs \nAct.  See Career Counseling, Inc. v. Amerifactors Finan-\ncial Group, LLC, No. 3:16-cv-03013, 2021 WL 3022677, \nat *8-*10 (D.S.C. July 16, 2021).  On appeal, the plaintiff \n\u201cargue[d] that the district court committed legal error \nin according Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC Ruling that an online fax service does not qualify as \na \u2018telephone facsimile machine\u2019 under the TCPA.\u201d  Career \nCounseling, 91 F.4th at 208.  \nBut the Fourth Circuit concluded that it \u201cneed not \nassess or determine whether the district court erred in \naccording Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC ruling.\u201d  Id. at 209.  That was so because it was \n\u00b4VDWLV\u00c0HG\u0003WR\u0003UXOH\u00b3GH\u0003QRYR\u00b3WKDW\u0003SXUVXDQW\u0003WR\u0003LWV\u0003SODLQ\u0003\nstatutory language, the TCPA prohibits the sending of \nunsolicited advertisements to what the district court \nlabelled as \u2018stand-alone fax machines,\u2019 but not to what the \ncourt accepted to be \u2018online fax services.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  That \nsame path of least resistance is present here.  \nAnd were this Court to disregard the statutory ques-\ntion and reverse the Ninth Circuit on the Hobbs Act, \nthat court on remand would then likely come to the same \nconclusion based on the plain statutory text.  If the Court \nwants to address the Hobbs Act question, it should await \na case where it might matter to the ultimate outcome.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nRespectfully submittted,\nDEANNE E.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been progressively refined, focusing on the central legal question of whether the Hobbs Act compels federal district courts to accept the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC) legal interpretations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).\n\nMy beliefs, built cumulatively, are as follows:\n\n*   **Core Precedent and Unresolved Question:** The entire case is structured as a direct follow-up to ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.***, 139 S. Ct. 2051 (2019). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on this exact question in that case but ultimately remanded without a decision, creating a clear signal of the Court's interest in the issue.\n\n*   **Procedural Hurdles in *PDR Network*:** I now understand the specific reasons for the remand in *PDR Network*. The majority identified two \"preliminary issues\" that prevented them from reaching the merits: (1) whether the FCC order was an \"interpretive\" vs. a \"legislative\" rule, and (2) whether the petitioner had a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity for judicial review under the Hobbs Act.\n\n*   **Petitioner's \"Ideal Vehicle\" Strategy:** The petitioner's primary argument is that this case is the \"ideal vehicle\" to finally resolve the question left open in *PDR Network*. They contend that the procedural hurdles from that case are absent here because: (1) controlling Ninth Circuit precedent (*U.S. West Commc'ns, Inc. v. Hamilton*) already holds that the Hobbs Act applies to both interpretive and legislative rules, and (2) the petitioner has not raised the \"adequate opportunity for review\" defense, meaning the lower court's decision rested purely on the binding effect of the Hobbs Act.\n\n*   **The Specific FCC Ruling at Issue:** The substantive dispute stems from the 2019 ***Amerifactors*** **declaratory ruling**, which interpreted the TCPA's definition of \"telephone facsimile machine\" to exclude online fax services. The district court's belief that it was bound by this ruling led directly to the decertification of the class.\n\n*   **Strong Signal from *PDR Network* Concurrence:** A critical piece of evidence shaping my predictive model is the petitioner's reliance on Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network*, which was joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch. This concurrence argued that the Hobbs Act, unlike other statutes, lacks an express preclusion clause and therefore does not prevent a defendant in a district court enforcement action from challenging an agency's legal interpretation. The fact that the district court in this very case expressed agreement with Kavanaugh's reasoning while feeling bound by circuit precedent provides a powerful signal that at least four justices are predisposed to favor the petitioner's argument.\n\n*   **Acknowledging One-Sided Information:** My most recent observation, an internal reasoning step, has critically updated my understanding of my own knowledge state. I now recognize that my beliefs are based almost entirely on the petitioner's framing of the case. While this provides a clear roadmap for a potential Supreme Court reversal, it is an incomplete picture. The primary source of uncertainty for my prediction is the absence of the respondent's (McKesson's) counterarguments. My predictive model must now account for the high probability that the respondent will directly attack the petitioner's \"ideal vehicle\" narrative. The key missing evidence is the respondent's \"Brief in Opposition,\" which will reveal whether they will argue that this case has its own procedural defects, defend the Ninth Circuit's precedent on its merits, or otherwise challenge the premise that this is a \"clean\" case for resolving the *PDR Network* question. My prediction now hinges not just on the strength of Kavanaugh's concurrence, but on how the respondent's forthcoming arguments might undermine the petitioner's carefully constructed procedural narrative.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been progressively refined, focusing on the central legal question of whether the Hobbs Act compels federal district courts to accept the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC) legal interpretations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The receipt of the respondent's Brief in Opposition has critically balanced my perspective, introducing significant counterarguments to the petitioner's narrative.\n\nMy beliefs, built cumulatively, are as follows:\n\n*   **Core Precedent and Unresolved Question:** The case remains fundamentally a vehicle to address the question the Supreme Court granted certiorari on but left unanswered in ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.***, 139 S. Ct. 2051 (2019): whether the Hobbs Act's exclusive review scheme prevents a party in a district court TCPA case from challenging an FCC order's legal interpretation.\n\n*   **Procedural Hurdles in *PDR Network*:** I maintain my understanding that the remand in *PDR Network* was due to two \"preliminary issues\": (1) whether the FCC order was an \"interpretive\" vs. a \"legislative\" rule, and (2) whether the petitioner had a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity for judicial review under the Hobbs Act.\n\n*   **Petitioner's \"Ideal Vehicle\" Strategy:** The petitioner's core strategy is to present this case as the \"ideal vehicle\" to resolve the *PDR Network* question, arguing that the procedural hurdles from that case are absent here.\n\n*   **Respondent's Counter-Narrative: The \"Poor Vehicle\" Argument:** The Brief in Opposition directly attacks the petitioner's strategy by arguing this is a \"poor vehicle\" for several reasons, which now form a major part of my predictive model:\n    *   **Flipping the Due Process Concern:** The respondent, McKesson, argues that the due process concerns from Justice Kavanaugh's *PDR Network* concurrence are absent here. In *PDR*, a *defendant* was being prevented from raising a defense. Here, the *plaintiff* (petitioner) is seeking to collaterally attack an FCC order to *expand* a defendant's liability. McKesson contends this role reversal negates the constitutional avoidance issue that animated the four-justice concurrence.\n    *   **Ongoing FCC Proceedings:** A critical new fact is that the FCC order at issue (*Amerifactors*) was issued by an FCC *bureau* on delegated authority, and an application for review by the *full Commission* remains pending. This introduces two significant vehicle problems: (1) the full FCC could act at any time, potentially altering or mooting the question before the Court; and (2) it resurrects the \"adequate opportunity for review\" issue from *PDR*, as McKesson argues the petitioner had a clear path to challenge the order through the administrative process and the Hobbs Act, but strategically chose not to.\n    *   **Alternative Grounds for Affirmance:** McKesson provides the Court with a clear \"off-ramp\" to avoid the Hobbs Act question. They argue the Ninth Circuit's decision is correct on the merits based on the TCPA's plain text, which they contend unambiguously excludes online fax services. They bolster this by citing a recent Fourth Circuit decision, ***Career Counseling, Inc. v. AmeriFactors Financial Grp., LLC***, 91 F.4th 202 (4th Cir. 2024), which reached the same conclusion on the statute's text. This makes it less likely the Court would grant review just to decide a procedural issue if the outcome would be the same regardless.\n\n*   **The \"Interpretive Rule\" vs. \"Adjudication\" Distinction:** The respondent's brief highlights that the petitioner's claimed circuit split is based on the treatment of \"interpretive rules.\" However, McKesson argues the Ninth Circuit below treated the *Amerifactors* order as an \"adjudication,\" a different category under the Administrative Procedure Act. By reframing the FCC order's nature, McKesson seeks to dissolve the purported circuit split, further weakening the case for granting certiorari.\n\n*   **Acknowledging a More Complete, Contested Picture:** My belief state has evolved from a one-sided view based on the petitioner's framing to a more complete and contested one. The primary uncertainty is no longer the *content* of the respondent's arguments, but how the Supreme Court will weigh these competing narratives. The petitioner's \"ideal vehicle\" argument is now directly countered by the respondent's \"poor vehicle\" argument, which is supported by several specific procedural facts (pending FCC review, plaintiff vs. defendant posture) and an alternative statutory ground for affirmance. My prediction now hinges on whether the four justices from the *PDR* concurrence still see this as a compelling opportunity to resolve the Hobbs Act question, despite the significant procedural and substantive off-ramps provided by the respondent.",

Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc., 588 \nU.S. 1 (2019): Does the Hobbs Act require a district court \nto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA? \nThe respondents do not deny that this is an important \nand recurring question of federal law on which the circuits \nare divided\u2014just as it was when the Court granted review \nin PDR Network. Nor do they deny that the Ninth Circuit \nbelow applied its controlling precedent on this question \nand held that the district court \u201ccorrectly found that it was \nbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA. \nPet. App. 7a. And, importantly, the respondents do not \ncontend that either of the \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that \nultimately frustrated resolution of the question presented \nin PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 4, will do the same here. \nNevertheless, the respondents spend 36 pages trying \nto convince the Court that it should pass up the chance to \nfinally resolve this important question and the split that it \nhas caused. Their arguments pose no barrier to review.   \nA. The respondents first argue (at 13\u201316) that there is \nno \u201cpost-PDR Network split about interpretive rules,\u201d \nand that deciding the question that this Court intended to \ndecide five years ago would be \u201cpremature.\u201d But the \npetition asks the Court to resolve the circuit split on the \nquestion presented, which goes well beyond interpretive \nrules. That split prompted the Court to grant certiorari in \nPDR Network, and it still exists today. Nor does it matter \nwhether the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order is properly \nclassified as the equivalent of an interpretive rule (as the \nrespondents argued below). What matters is that, as the \ndistrict court below recognized, controlling Ninth Circuit \nprecedent treats the Amerifactors order as binding under \n\n- 2 - \n \nthe Hobbs Act regardless of how it\u2019s characterized. So the \nfirst preliminary issue identified in PDR Network stands \nas no obstacle to reaching the question presented here. \nNor would it be premature for the Court to decide that \nquestion now. The issue was ripe in 2018, when the Court \ngranted certiorari in PDR Network. And since then, the \nneed for authoritative resolution has only grown. Within \nmonths of this Court\u2019s decision declining to resolve the \nsplit, a full panel of the Eleventh Circuit called on that \ncourt \u201cto correct [its] mistake en banc\u201d \u201cin the earliest \nappropriate case.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., \nLP, 931 F.3d 1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But neither that court nor the Ninth Circuit \nin this case has done so. As a result, the pre-PDR Network \nsplit is alive and well. It now falls to this Court to bring \nneeded uniformity to the law on this important question. \nB. The respondents then turn to the merits (at 16\u201326). \nThe argue that the answer to the question presented is \nyes\u2014the Hobbs Act requires a district court in an as-\napplied enforcement proceeding to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA. That is so, they say, because \notherwise the court would have to \u201cdetermine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018sound [or] good,\u2019\u201d which the \nHobbs Act (in their view) prevents it from doing. BIO 17. \nThis argument was squarely rejected by four Justices in \nPDR Network, and the question to be resolved here will \nbe whether their reading of the Hobbs Act is correct. The \npetitioner says it is; the respondents say it\u2019s not. The point \nof plenary review will be to determine who\u2019s right. \nYet the bulk of the respondents\u2019 merits section is not \nabout the text of the Hobbs Act\u2014or even about the Hobbs \nAct at all. It is instead about whether the FCC was right \nto interpret the TCPA the way that it did. See BIO 21\u201326. \nBut that issue, which the Ninth Circuit did not reach, will \n\n- 3 - \n \nbe an issue for a lower court on remand. It has nothing to \ndo with the question presented and will not \u201cprevent the \nCourt from deciding the question presented.\u201d Contra BIO \n34. The question presented is whether a district court is \nbarred from even conducting a statutory analysis, not who \nwill prevail here should the court be permitted to do so.   \nC. Finally, the respondents make a vehicle argument. \nSee BIO 27\u201335. They claim that there are two distinctions \nbetween this case and PDR Network that make this case \nan unsuitable replacement for PDR Network. The most \n\u201cfundamental difference,\u201d in their eyes (at 17), is that in \nPDR Network, the party arguing that the Hobbs Act does \nnot require a district court to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA was the defendant, whereas \nhere it\u2019s the plaintiff. The respondents contend that this \nCourt \u201cshould await a case in which a defendant questions \nthe statutory interpretation in an FCC order.\u201d BIO 3.  \nBut the question presented is about the meaning of a \nstatute. And the Hobbs Act contains no hint that it means \nsomething different depending on which party is invoking \nit. Either the statute requires a district court to adhere to \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in an enforcement \naction or it does not. But the answer will not be different \ndepending on who happens to benefit from the FCC order. \nNor did Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, suggest any such reading of the statute. To the \ncontrary, his reading applies to plaintiffs and defendants \nalike. See 588 U.S. at 27 (\u201cIn an as-applied enforcement \naction, the district court should interpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). Although his opinion often \nframes the issue from the vantage point of a TCPA \ndefendant, it does so because that was the posture of that \ncase\u2014not because its textual analysis is reserved solely \n\n- 4 - \n \nfor the benefit of defendants. Contra BIO 18\u201319; see also \nGorss, 931 F.3d at 1109 (Pryor, J., concurring) (observing \nthat a \u201cstark implication[] of our misconstruction of the \nHobbs Act\u201d is that \u201ca plaintiff with a viable claim under \nthe law Congress enacted may be unable to pursue it \nsimply because an agency has misinterpreted the law in \nan order to which he was a not a party\u201d). No circuit, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit, has drawn any such atextual \ndistinction. Indeed, not even the respondents argue that \nthe statute\u2019s text could mean one thing for defendants and \nanother for plaintiffs. They simply disagree with Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s textual analysis, thus underscoring the \nappropriateness of this case as a vehicle. \nThe respondents also try to make something of the fact \nthat the FCC order in PDR Network predated that case \nby many years, whereas this case was filed six years \nbefore the Amerifactors order. That distinction, however, \nhas no bearing on the question presented. Unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \nprior or adequate opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct, which was the second preliminary issue noted in this \nCourt\u2019s opinion. So this difference, if anything, makes this \ncase a better vehicle than PDR Network, not a worse one. \nNor is there any realistic possibility that FCC action \nwill affect this Court\u2019s review. The respondents speculate \n(at 28) that the FCC could thwart review by acting on a \nfour-year-old application and reversing the Amerifactors \norder. But the respondents give no reason to think that \nthis will actually happen, and the theoretical possibility \nthat an agency could later change its mind is no reason for \nthis Court to stay its hand when the agency action is \ncausing real harm to real people. And here, not only is \nthere no deadline for the FCC to act, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4), \nbut the respondents point to no example of the FCC ever \n\n- 5 - \n \noverturning an interpretation that had been reached on \ndelegated authority, much less doing so without first \nengaging in notice and comment. Far from offering a \nreason why the FCC will reverse course, the respondents \ndo the opposite: They say that the order represents the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment\u201d and is \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d correct. \nBIO 26, 34. Again, if the respondents are right about what \nthe TCPA means, they should prevail on the merits on \nremand\u2014but only because a court reached that \nconclusion, not because an agency did so.  \nAs for the respondents\u2019 argument that the petitioner \nshould be bound by the FCC\u2019s order under \u201cnormal \npreclusion principles,\u201d BIO 32, that argument is even \nmore off-base. It is wrong, independent of the question \npresented, and waived to boot. The petitioner was entitled \nto make its statutory arguments\u2014and to continue seeking \nas-applied relief\u2014in the same case that it had been \nlitigating for six years before the FCC order. It was not \nrequired to halt that litigation and pursue the \u201cconvoluted \nroute\u201d of Hobbs Act review. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 25 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But that\u2019s an argument that \ncan be dealt with by the Ninth Circuit on remand, along \nwith the question of whether the respondents have even \npreserved the issue. It is not an impediment to this Court\u2019s \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \n The petition for certiorari should be granted. \n\n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n       Respectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc., 588 \nU.S. 1 (2019): Does the Hobbs Act require a district court \nto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA? \nThe respondents do not deny that this is an important \nand recurring question of federal law on which the circuits \nare divided\u2014just as it was when the Court granted review \nin PDR Network. Nor do they deny that the Ninth Circuit \nbelow applied its controlling precedent on this question \nand held that the district court \u201ccorrectly found that it was \nbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA. \nPet. App. 7a. And, importantly, the respondents do not \ncontend that either of the \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that \nultimately frustrated resolution of the question presented \nin PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 4, will do the same here. \nNevertheless, the respondents spend 36 pages trying \nto convince the Court that it should pass up the chance to \nfinally resolve this important question and the split that it \nhas caused. Their arguments pose no barrier to review.   \nA. The respondents first argue (at 13\u201316) that there is \nno \u201cpost-PDR Network split about interpretive rules,\u201d \nand that deciding the question that this Court intended to \ndecide five years ago would be \u201cpremature.\u201d But the \npetition asks the Court to resolve the circuit split on the \nquestion presented, which goes well beyond interpretive \nrules. That split prompted the Court to grant certiorari in \nPDR Network, and it still exists today. Nor does it matter \nwhether the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order is properly \nclassified as the equivalent of an interpretive rule (as the \nrespondents argued below). What matters is that, as the \ndistrict court below recognized, controlling Ninth Circuit \nprecedent treats the Amerifactors order as binding under \n\n- 2 - \n \nthe Hobbs Act regardless of how it\u2019s characterized. So the \nfirst preliminary issue identified in PDR Network stands \nas no obstacle to reaching the question presented here. \nNor would it be premature for the Court to decide that \nquestion now. The issue was ripe in 2018, when the Court \ngranted certiorari in PDR Network. And since then, the \nneed for authoritative resolution has only grown. Within \nmonths of this Court\u2019s decision declining to resolve the \nsplit, a full panel of the Eleventh Circuit called on that \ncourt \u201cto correct [its] mistake en banc\u201d \u201cin the earliest \nappropriate case.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., \nLP, 931 F.3d 1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But neither that court nor the Ninth Circuit \nin this case has done so. As a result, the pre-PDR Network \nsplit is alive and well. It now falls to this Court to bring \nneeded uniformity to the law on this important question. \nB. The respondents then turn to the merits (at 16\u201326). \nThe argue that the answer to the question presented is \nyes\u2014the Hobbs Act requires a district court in an as-\napplied enforcement proceeding to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA. That is so, they say, because \notherwise the court would have to \u201cdetermine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018sound [or] good,\u2019\u201d which the \nHobbs Act (in their view) prevents it from doing. BIO 17. \nThis argument was squarely rejected by four Justices in \nPDR Network, and the question to be resolved here will \nbe whether their reading of the Hobbs Act is correct. The \npetitioner says it is; the respondents say it\u2019s not. The point \nof plenary review will be to determine who\u2019s right. \nYet the bulk of the respondents\u2019 merits section is not \nabout the text of the Hobbs Act\u2014or even about the Hobbs \nAct at all. It is instead about whether the FCC was right \nto interpret the TCPA the way that it did. See BIO 21\u201326. \nBut that issue, which the Ninth Circuit did not reach, will \n\n- 3 - \n \nbe an issue for a lower court on remand. It has nothing to \ndo with the question presented and will not \u201cprevent the \nCourt from deciding the question presented.\u201d Contra BIO \n34. The question presented is whether a district court is \nbarred from even conducting a statutory analysis, not who \nwill prevail here should the court be permitted to do so.   \nC. Finally, the respondents make a vehicle argument. \nSee BIO 27\u201335. They claim that there are two distinctions \nbetween this case and PDR Network that make this case \nan unsuitable replacement for PDR Network. The most \n\u201cfundamental difference,\u201d in their eyes (at 17), is that in \nPDR Network, the party arguing that the Hobbs Act does \nnot require a district court to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA was the defendant, whereas \nhere it\u2019s the plaintiff. The respondents contend that this \nCourt \u201cshould await a case in which a defendant questions \nthe statutory interpretation in an FCC order.\u201d BIO 3.  \nBut the question presented is about the meaning of a \nstatute. And the Hobbs Act contains no hint that it means \nsomething different depending on which party is invoking \nit. Either the statute requires a district court to adhere to \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in an enforcement \naction or it does not. But the answer will not be different \ndepending on who happens to benefit from the FCC order. \nNor did Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, suggest any such reading of the statute. To the \ncontrary, his reading applies to plaintiffs and defendants \nalike. See 588 U.S. at 27 (\u201cIn an as-applied enforcement \naction, the district court should interpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). Although his opinion often \nframes the issue from the vantage point of a TCPA \ndefendant, it does so because that was the posture of that \ncase\u2014not because its textual analysis is reserved solely \n\n- 4 - \n \nfor the benefit of defendants. Contra BIO 18\u201319; see also \nGorss, 931 F.3d at 1109 (Pryor, J., concurring) (observing \nthat a \u201cstark implication[] of our misconstruction of the \nHobbs Act\u201d is that \u201ca plaintiff with a viable claim under \nthe law Congress enacted may be unable to pursue it \nsimply because an agency has misinterpreted the law in \nan order to which he was a not a party\u201d). No circuit, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit, has drawn any such atextual \ndistinction. Indeed, not even the respondents argue that \nthe statute\u2019s text could mean one thing for defendants and \nanother for plaintiffs. They simply disagree with Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s textual analysis, thus underscoring the \nappropriateness of this case as a vehicle. \nThe respondents also try to make something of the fact \nthat the FCC order in PDR Network predated that case \nby many years, whereas this case was filed six years \nbefore the Amerifactors order. That distinction, however, \nhas no bearing on the question presented. Unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \nprior or adequate opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct, which was the second preliminary issue noted in this \nCourt\u2019s opinion. So this difference, if anything, makes this \ncase a better vehicle than PDR Network, not a worse one. \nNor is there any realistic possibility that FCC action \nwill affect this Court\u2019s review. The respondents speculate \n(at 28) that the FCC could thwart review by acting on a \nfour-year-old application and reversing the Amerifactors \norder. But the respondents give no reason to think that \nthis will actually happen, and the theoretical possibility \nthat an agency could later change its mind is no reason for \nthis Court to stay its hand when the agency action is \ncausing real harm to real people. And here, not only is \nthere no deadline for the FCC to act, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4), \nbut the respondents point to no example of the FCC ever \n\n- 5 - \n \noverturning an interpretation that had been reached on \ndelegated authority, much less doing so without first \nengaging in notice and comment. Far from offering a \nreason why the FCC will reverse course, the respondents \ndo the opposite: They say that the order represents the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment\u201d and is \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d correct. \nBIO 26, 34. Again, if the respondents are right about what \nthe TCPA means, they should prevail on the merits on \nremand\u2014but only because a court reached that \nconclusion, not because an agency did so.  \nAs for the respondents\u2019 argument that the petitioner \nshould be bound by the FCC\u2019s order under \u201cnormal \npreclusion principles,\u201d BIO 32, that argument is even \nmore off-base. It is wrong, independent of the question \npresented, and waived to boot. The petitioner was entitled \nto make its statutory arguments\u2014and to continue seeking \nas-applied relief\u2014in the same case that it had been \nlitigating for six years before the FCC order. It was not \nrequired to halt that litigation and pursue the \u201cconvoluted \nroute\u201d of Hobbs Act review. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 25 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But that\u2019s an argument that \ncan be dealt with by the Ninth Circuit on remand, along \nwith the question of whether the respondents have even \npreserved the issue. It is not an impediment to this Court\u2019s \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \n The petition for certiorari should be granted. \n\n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n       Respectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

This step confirmed the strategic direction of my analysis but did not alter the substantive facts or arguments influencing my prediction.\n\nMy beliefs, therefore, are a consolidation of my previous understanding, now with a clear focus on the next anticipated piece of evidence:\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict:** The central dynamic of this case at the certiorari stage remains the direct clash between two narratives. The petitioner presents this case as the \"ideal vehicle\" to finally resolve the Hobbs Act question left open in ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.***. Conversely, the respondent argues it is a \"poor vehicle,\" a position I now see as well-supported and a significant hurdle for the petitioner.\n\n*   **Respondent's \"Off-Ramps\" Remain Key:** The respondent's brief in opposition has established several powerful arguments that could persuade the Court to deny certiorari. These remain the focal points of my predictive model:\n    1.  **Pending FCC Review:** The fact that the underlying FCC *Amerifactors* order is still under review by the full Commission presents a major vehicle problem. It raises ripeness/finality issues and suggests the Court's intervention would be premature.\n    2.  **Lack of Due Process Urgency:** The respondent effectively reframed the due process concern from *PDR Network*. Here, a plaintiff (petitioner) seeks to use the Hobbs Act to prevent a defendant from raising a defense, which is a less compelling constitutional scenario than in *PDR*, where a defendant was being deprived of a defense.\n    3.  **Alternative Statutory Grounds:** The respondent's argument that the Ninth Circuit's decision can be affirmed on the plain text of the TCPA\u2014an argument bolstered by the Fourth Circuit's recent, similar holding in ***Career Counseling, Inc. v. AmeriFactors***\u2014provides the Court a clear path to avoid the complex procedural question altogether.\n    4.  **Dissolving the Circuit Split:** The respondent's distinction between an \"interpretive rule\" and an \"adjudication\" continues to be a salient point that weakens the petitioner's claim of a clear and entrenched circuit split requiring the Court's attention.\n\n*   **Anticipating the Reply Brief:** The latest observation solidified my understanding that the next critical data point is the petitioner's reply brief. My analysis is now primed to evaluate how, or if, the petitioner can rebut the respondent's \"poor vehicle\" arguments. Specifically, I will be looking for the petitioner's response to the pending FCC review and the argument that there are independent statutory grounds for the lower court's decision. The strength of that rebuttal will be a primary indicator of whether the four justices interested in this issue from *PDR Network* will find this case compelling enough to grant review despite the procedural and substantive off-ramps. My confidence in a prediction of grant or deny is currently low and hinges almost entirely on the content of that forthcoming brief.",

Conversely, the absence of any amicus support would temper my current optimism, suggesting the issue may not be as pressing as the petitioner argues. This action directly probes a key variable in the certiorari calculus, promising a significant update to my prediction model (high Task EIG). It also reinforces the general strategy of weighing amicus support as a primary indicator of importance, refining my understanding of how different types of amici influence the Court's decision-making (high Design EIG).",

L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. \n2394.  In this case, petitioner sued respondents in fed-\neral district court, alleging that respondents had vio-\nlated the TCPA by transmitting unsolicited faxes.  Dur-\ning the litigation, the FCC\u2019s Consumer and Governmen-\ntal Affairs Bureau issued an order clarifying that unso-\nlicited faxes sent to online fax services do not violate the \nTCPA.  The district court concluded that, in light of the \nHobbs Act, the court was required to adhere to the Bu-\nreau\u2019s order and to reject petitioner\u2019s effort to impose \nTCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited faxes sent \nto an online fax service.  The court of appeals affirmed.  \nThe question presented is as follows: \nWhether the Hobbs Act\u2019s vesting of \u201cexclusive juris-\ndiction\u201d in the courts of appeals to \u201cdetermine the va-\nlidity\u201d of a covered agency action, 28 U.S.C. 2342, bars \ncollateral attacks on the same agency action in district-\ncourt litigation between private parties. \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument: \nThe Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks on the validity of \na covered FCC order in district-court litigation \nbetween private parties .......................................................... 9 \nA.

The \nparties in this case dispute whether that exclusivity pro-\nvision bars litigants from contesting the legality of the \nspecified agency orders in private district-court litiga-\ntion.  Such collateral attacks would undermine the in-\nterests of regulated parties and of the federal agencies \ninvolved in promptly and conclusively determining the \nvalidity of covered agency actions.  The United States \ntherefore has a substantial interest in the question pre-\nsented. \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutes are reprinted in an appendix to \nthis brief.  App., infra, 1a-11a. \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Hobbs Act gives courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in \npart), or to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d certain agency  \nactions, including \u201call final orders\u201d of the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC) \u201cmade reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  The Act \nalso applies to specified actions of the Secretary  \nof Agriculture, Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-\nopment, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Trans-\nportation, Board of Immigration Appeals, Federal Mar-\nitime Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nand Surface Transportation Board.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1252(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. 2342(2)-(7); 50 U.S.C. 167h(b); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 5841(f\u200a). \n\u201cAny party aggrieved by\u201d a final agency action cov-\nered by the statute \u201cmay, within 60 days after its entry, \nfile a petition to review the order in the court of appeals \nwherein venue lies.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  \u201cThe action shall \nbe against the United States,\u201d ibid., and the \u201cagency  \n* * *  may appear as [a] part[y] thereto  * * *  as of \nright,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2348.  When more than one petition for \nreview is filed with respect to a particular final agency \norder, the petitions are consolidated in a single court of \nappeals.  28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). \nCongress enacted the Hobbs Act in 1950, following a \nrequest by Chief Justice Stone to reform the judicial-\nreview procedures that had previously applied under \nthe Act of Oct. 22, 1913 (Urgent Deficiencies Act), ch. \n32, 38 Stat. 208, to certain FCC orders and other agency \nactions.  See H.R. Rep. No. 2122, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.  \n\n3 \n \n2 (1950).  Under the prior scheme, litigants could seek \nreview in a three-judge district court under specialized \nprocedures, with a right of appeal to this Court.  Ibid.  \nThe Hobbs Act replaced that scheme with a system of \nexclusive circuit-court review under which the Attorney \nGeneral can \u201crepresent the interest of the Government \nwhenever an order of one of the specified agencies is  \nreviewed.\u201d  Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. \nRederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 70 (1970). \n2. a. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of \n1991 (TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, gen-\nerally prohibits sending an unsolicited advertisement to \na \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d from another such ma-\nchine or from a computer or other device.  47 U.S.C. \n227(b)(1)(C).  The statute defines \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d to mean \u201cequipment which has the capacity \n(A) to transcribe text or images, or both, from paper \ninto an electronic signal and to transmit that signal over \na regular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or im-\nages (or both) from an electronic signal received over a \nregular telephone line onto paper.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 227(a)(3). \nThe FCC administers the TCPA.  47 U.S.C. 227(b)(2) \n(2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  In certain circumstances, the \nagency\u2019s Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau \nis authorized to act on the Commission\u2019s behalf.  47 \nC.F.R. 0.141(a), 0.361.  When the Bureau exercises au-\nthority delegated by the Commission, any \u201cperson ag-\ngrieved  * * *  may file an application for review by the \nCommission  * * *  and every such application shall be \npassed upon by the Commission.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4); \nsee 47 C.F.R. 1.115(a).  The filing of such an application \nfor review is a \u201ccondition precedent to judicial review\u201d \nof an action taken by the Bureau on delegated authority.  \n47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7); see 47 C.F.R. 1.115(k). \n\n4 \n \nThe government may enforce the TCPA.  See, e.g., \n47 U.S.C. 501-503.  The TCPA also creates private rights \nof action to enforce certain provisions and regulations.  \n47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3) and (c)(5).  Federal and state courts \nhave concurrent jurisdiction over private TCPA law-\nsuits.  Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n371-372 (2012). \nb. In 2002, the FCC sought public comment on a va-\nriety of TCPA-related issues, including the proper \ntreatment of \u201cfax servers.\u201d  17 FCC Rcd 17,459, 17,482 \n\u00b6 37.  In 2003, the agency issued an order finalizing \nchanges to its rules.  18 FCC Rcd 14,014, 14,017 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.  \nThe FCC explained that fax servers \u201cenable multiple \ndesktops to send and receive faxes from the same or \nshared telephone lines.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 200.  Some com-\nmenters had argued that faxes transmitted to fax serv-\ners are not covered by the TCPA because such faxes are \nnot necessarily \u201creduced to paper.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 199.  \nThe Commission disagreed, explaining that the statu-\ntory definition of a \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d en-\ncompasses devices that have \u201cthe capacity to transcribe \ntext or images\u201d to paper.  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 201. \nIn 2009, a regulated party petitioned the FCC for \nclarification of how the TCPA \u201capplies to the transmis-\nsion of efaxes,\u201d which the party described as \u201c\u200a\u2018a fax that \nis converted to email\u2019\u200a\u201d after being received.  30 FCC \nRcd 8620, 8621 \u00b6 4 (2015).  The petition was referred to \nthe Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, which \nsolicited public comment and ultimately concluded that \n\u201cefaxes are subject to the TCPA.\u201d  Id. at 8622 \u00b6 7. \nIn 2017, the Bureau received a petition for a declar-\natory ruling regarding the application of the TCPA to a \n\u201ccloud-based\u201d online fax service, in which faxes received \nby the service are made available to users digitally,  \n\n5 \n \neither via a website or as email attachments.  34 FCC \nRcd 11,950, 11,950 \u00b6 2 (2019) (Amerifactors) (citation \nomitted); see id. at 11,951 \u00b6 6.  After seeking public com-\nment, the Bureau concluded in a 2019 order that faxes \nsent to such an online fax service are \u201coutside the scope\u201d \nof the TCPA.  Id. at 11,952 \u00b6 8.  The Bureau explained \nthat the cloud service \u201ccannot itself print a fax\u2014the \nuser of an online fax service must connect his or her own \nequipment in order to do so.\u201d  Id. at 11,953 \u00b6 11. \nIn 2020, the Commission received an application for \nreview of the Bureau\u2019s Amerifactors order.  See Career \nCounseling Services\u2019 Application for Review, In re \nAmerifactors Financial Group, LLC Petition for Expe-\ndited Declaratory Ruling, CG Docket Nos. 02-278, 05-\n338 (Jan. 8, 2020).  That application remains pending \nwith the Commission. \n3. The present controversy arises from a private \nTCPA suit in the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of California, which petitioner joined \nas a co-plaintiff in 2014.  Pet. App. 25a.  The gravamen \nof the complaint is that respondents \u201cviolated the TCPA \nby sending \u2018unsolicited advertisements\u2019 by fax.\u201d  Ibid. \n(citation omitted). \nThe district court initially denied a motion for class \ncertification; the plaintiffs appealed; and the court of \nappeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and re-\nmanded.  896 F.3d 923, 926, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2743.  \nOn remand, the district court granted a renewed motion \nfor class certification, appointed petitioner to represent \nthe class, and denied respondents\u2019 motion for summary \njudgment.  332 F.R.D. 589, 610. \nIn 2020, respondents moved to decertify the class on \nthe theory that, in light of Amerifactors, \u201cindividualized \ninquiries\u201d would be necessary \u201cto determine whether \n\n6 \n \nclass members received the advertisements through \nonline fax services or traditional analog fax machines.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a.  The district court understood circuit \nprecedent to require it to treat Amerifactors as \u201cau-\nthoritative.\u201d  Id. at 36a.  But rather than decertify the \nclass, the court initially bifurcated it into two groups, \ndepending on whether particular class members had re-\nceived advertisements via a \u201c\u200a\u2018stand-alone\u2019 fax machine\u201d \nor via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 39a-40a.  Based on \nAmerifactors, the court later entered summary judg-\nment for respondents on all TCPA claims asserted by \nthe online-fax-service class.  Id. at 21a-23a. \nAfter further discovery, the district court decertified \nthe standalone-fax-machine class.  Pet. App. 12a-20a.  \nThe court concluded that no reliable method existed to \nshow \u201cvia classwide, common proof\u200a\u201d which faxes were \nsent to standalone fax machines rather than online fax \nservices, so that individualized questions about how a \ngiven plaintiff received a given fax would predominate \nover any common questions.  Id. at 15a; see id. at 18a. \n4. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-11a.  \nAs relevant here, the court held that the district court \nhad \u201ccorrectly found that it was bound by\u201d the \u201cAmerifac-\ntors declaratory ruling, which determined that the \nTCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Petitioner had argued \nthat the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision does not ap-\nply because \u201cAmerifactors is neither an order of the \nCommission, nor final.\u201d  Ibid.  The court of appeals \nacknowledged that an application for Commission re-\nview of Amerifactors remained pending, but the court \nconcluded that Amerifactors nonetheless constitutes a \n\u201cfinal order of the Commission made reviewable by Sec-\ntion 402(a)\u201d of Title 47.  Id. at 8a-9a.  The court based \n\n7 \n \nthat conclusion on circuit precedent and on an FCC reg-\nulation stating that Bureau orders are generally effec-\ntive upon release.  See id. at 7a-8a & n.1.  Accordingly, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the district court \nlacked authority to \u201cdisagree[] with Amerifactors\u201d by \nimposing TCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited \nfaxes sent to online fax services.  Id. at 9a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars district \ncourts from entertaining collateral attacks on covered \nagency actions in litigation between private parties.   \nA.  As an initial matter, this case comes to the Court \nbased on an erroneous premise.  The courts below viewed \nAmerifactors as a \u201cfinal order of the [FCC] made re-\nviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  \nBut Amerifactors was issued by a bureau of the FCC on \ndelegated authority, and an application for Commission \nreview of the order remains pending.  Because the Com-\nmission\u2019s disposition of the pending application is a \n\u201ccondition precedent\u201d to judicial review, 47 U.S.C. \n155(c)(7), Amerifactors has never been susceptible to \ndirect court-of-appeals review, and the exclusivity pro-\nvision does not apply to it. \nB.  If the Court assumes for purposes of this case \nthat Amerifactors is a final order to which the Hobbs \nA\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. \n2394.  In this case, petitioner sued respondents in fed-\neral district court, alleging that respondents had vio-\nlated the TCPA by transmitting unsolicited faxes.  Dur-\ning the litigation, the FCC\u2019s Consumer and Governmen-\ntal Affairs Bureau issued an order clarifying that unso-\nlicited faxes sent to online fax services do not violate the \nTCPA.  The district court concluded that, in light of the \nHobbs Act, the court was required to adhere to the Bu-\nreau\u2019s order and to reject petitioner\u2019s effort to impose \nTCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited faxes sent \nto an online fax service.  The court of appeals affirmed.  \nThe question presented is as follows: \nWhether the Hobbs Act\u2019s vesting of \u201cexclusive juris-\ndiction\u201d in the courts of appeals to \u201cdetermine the va-\nlidity\u201d of a covered agency action, 28 U.S.C. 2342, bars \ncollateral attacks on the same agency action in district-\ncourt litigation between private parties. \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument: \nThe Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks on the validity of \na covered FCC order in district-court litigation \nbetween private parties .......................................................... 9 \nA.

The \nparties in this case dispute whether that exclusivity pro-\nvision bars litigants from contesting the legality of the \nspecified agency orders in private district-court litiga-\ntion.  Such collateral attacks would undermine the in-\nterests of regulated parties and of the federal agencies \ninvolved in promptly and conclusively determining the \nvalidity of covered agency actions.  The United States \ntherefore has a substantial interest in the question pre-\nsented. \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutes are reprinted in an appendix to \nthis brief.  App., infra, 1a-11a. \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Hobbs Act gives courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in \npart), or to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d certain agency  \nactions, including \u201call final orders\u201d of the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC) \u201cmade reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  The Act \nalso applies to specified actions of the Secretary  \nof Agriculture, Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-\nopment, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Trans-\nportation, Board of Immigration Appeals, Federal Mar-\nitime Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nand Surface Transportation Board.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1252(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. 2342(2)-(7); 50 U.S.C. 167h(b); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 5841(f\u200a). \n\u201cAny party aggrieved by\u201d a final agency action cov-\nered by the statute \u201cmay, within 60 days after its entry, \nfile a petition to review the order in the court of appeals \nwherein venue lies.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  \u201cThe action shall \nbe against the United States,\u201d ibid., and the \u201cagency  \n* * *  may appear as [a] part[y] thereto  * * *  as of \nright,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2348.  When more than one petition for \nreview is filed with respect to a particular final agency \norder, the petitions are consolidated in a single court of \nappeals.  28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). \nCongress enacted the Hobbs Act in 1950, following a \nrequest by Chief Justice Stone to reform the judicial-\nreview procedures that had previously applied under \nthe Act of Oct. 22, 1913 (Urgent Deficiencies Act), ch. \n32, 38 Stat. 208, to certain FCC orders and other agency \nactions.  See H.R. Rep. No. 2122, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.  \n\n3 \n \n2 (1950).  Under the prior scheme, litigants could seek \nreview in a three-judge district court under specialized \nprocedures, with a right of appeal to this Court.  Ibid.  \nThe Hobbs Act replaced that scheme with a system of \nexclusive circuit-court review under which the Attorney \nGeneral can \u201crepresent the interest of the Government \nwhenever an order of one of the specified agencies is  \nreviewed.\u201d  Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. \nRederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 70 (1970). \n2. a. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of \n1991 (TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, gen-\nerally prohibits sending an unsolicited advertisement to \na \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d from another such ma-\nchine or from a computer or other device.  47 U.S.C. \n227(b)(1)(C).  The statute defines \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d to mean \u201cequipment which has the capacity \n(A) to transcribe text or images, or both, from paper \ninto an electronic signal and to transmit that signal over \na regular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or im-\nages (or both) from an electronic signal received over a \nregular telephone line onto paper.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 227(a)(3). \nThe FCC administers the TCPA.  47 U.S.C. 227(b)(2) \n(2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  In certain circumstances, the \nagency\u2019s Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau \nis authorized to act on the Commission\u2019s behalf.  47 \nC.F.R. 0.141(a), 0.361.  When the Bureau exercises au-\nthority delegated by the Commission, any \u201cperson ag-\ngrieved  * * *  may file an application for review by the \nCommission  * * *  and every such application shall be \npassed upon by the Commission.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4); \nsee 47 C.F.R. 1.115(a).  The filing of such an application \nfor review is a \u201ccondition precedent to judicial review\u201d \nof an action taken by the Bureau on delegated authority.  \n47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7); see 47 C.F.R. 1.115(k). \n\n4 \n \nThe government may enforce the TCPA.  See, e.g., \n47 U.S.C. 501-503.  The TCPA also creates private rights \nof action to enforce certain provisions and regulations.  \n47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3) and (c)(5).  Federal and state courts \nhave concurrent jurisdiction over private TCPA law-\nsuits.  Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n371-372 (2012). \nb. In 2002, the FCC sought public comment on a va-\nriety of TCPA-related issues, including the proper \ntreatment of \u201cfax servers.\u201d  17 FCC Rcd 17,459, 17,482 \n\u00b6 37.  In 2003, the agency issued an order finalizing \nchanges to its rules.  18 FCC Rcd 14,014, 14,017 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.  \nThe FCC explained that fax servers \u201cenable multiple \ndesktops to send and receive faxes from the same or \nshared telephone lines.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 200.  Some com-\nmenters had argued that faxes transmitted to fax serv-\ners are not covered by the TCPA because such faxes are \nnot necessarily \u201creduced to paper.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 199.  \nThe Commission disagreed, explaining that the statu-\ntory definition of a \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d en-\ncompasses devices that have \u201cthe capacity to transcribe \ntext or images\u201d to paper.  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 201. \nIn 2009, a regulated party petitioned the FCC for \nclarification of how the TCPA \u201capplies to the transmis-\nsion of efaxes,\u201d which the party described as \u201c\u200a\u2018a fax that \nis converted to email\u2019\u200a\u201d after being received.  30 FCC \nRcd 8620, 8621 \u00b6 4 (2015).  The petition was referred to \nthe Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, which \nsolicited public comment and ultimately concluded that \n\u201cefaxes are subject to the TCPA.\u201d  Id. at 8622 \u00b6 7. \nIn 2017, the Bureau received a petition for a declar-\natory ruling regarding the application of the TCPA to a \n\u201ccloud-based\u201d online fax service, in which faxes received \nby the service are made available to users digitally,  \n\n5 \n \neither via a website or as email attachments.  34 FCC \nRcd 11,950, 11,950 \u00b6 2 (2019) (Amerifactors) (citation \nomitted); see id. at 11,951 \u00b6 6.  After seeking public com-\nment, the Bureau concluded in a 2019 order that faxes \nsent to such an online fax service are \u201coutside the scope\u201d \nof the TCPA.  Id. at 11,952 \u00b6 8.  The Bureau explained \nthat the cloud service \u201ccannot itself print a fax\u2014the \nuser of an online fax service must connect his or her own \nequipment in order to do so.\u201d  Id. at 11,953 \u00b6 11. \nIn 2020, the Commission received an application for \nreview of the Bureau\u2019s Amerifactors order.  See Career \nCounseling Services\u2019 Application for Review, In re \nAmerifactors Financial Group, LLC Petition for Expe-\ndited Declaratory Ruling, CG Docket Nos. 02-278, 05-\n338 (Jan. 8, 2020).  That application remains pending \nwith the Commission. \n3. The present controversy arises from a private \nTCPA suit in the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of California, which petitioner joined \nas a co-plaintiff in 2014.  Pet. App. 25a.  The gravamen \nof the complaint is that respondents \u201cviolated the TCPA \nby sending \u2018unsolicited advertisements\u2019 by fax.\u201d  Ibid. \n(citation omitted). \nThe district court initially denied a motion for class \ncertification; the plaintiffs appealed; and the court of \nappeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and re-\nmanded.  896 F.3d 923, 926, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2743.  \nOn remand, the district court granted a renewed motion \nfor class certification, appointed petitioner to represent \nthe class, and denied respondents\u2019 motion for summary \njudgment.  332 F.R.D. 589, 610. \nIn 2020, respondents moved to decertify the class on \nthe theory that, in light of Amerifactors, \u201cindividualized \ninquiries\u201d would be necessary \u201cto determine whether \n\n6 \n \nclass members received the advertisements through \nonline fax services or traditional analog fax machines.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a.  The district court understood circuit \nprecedent to require it to treat Amerifactors as \u201cau-\nthoritative.\u201d  Id. at 36a.  But rather than decertify the \nclass, the court initially bifurcated it into two groups, \ndepending on whether particular class members had re-\nceived advertisements via a \u201c\u200a\u2018stand-alone\u2019 fax machine\u201d \nor via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 39a-40a.  Based on \nAmerifactors, the court later entered summary judg-\nment for respondents on all TCPA claims asserted by \nthe online-fax-service class.  Id. at 21a-23a. \nAfter further discovery, the district court decertified \nthe standalone-fax-machine class.  Pet. App. 12a-20a.  \nThe court concluded that no reliable method existed to \nshow \u201cvia classwide, common proof\u200a\u201d which faxes were \nsent to standalone fax machines rather than online fax \nservices, so that individualized questions about how a \ngiven plaintiff received a given fax would predominate \nover any common questions.  Id. at 15a; see id. at 18a. \n4. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-11a.  \nAs relevant here, the court held that the district court \nhad \u201ccorrectly found that it was bound by\u201d the \u201cAmerifac-\ntors declaratory ruling, which determined that the \nTCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Petitioner had argued \nthat the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision does not ap-\nply because \u201cAmerifactors is neither an order of the \nCommission, nor final.\u201d  Ibid.  The court of appeals \nacknowledged that an application for Commission re-\nview of Amerifactors remained pending, but the court \nconcluded that Amerifactors nonetheless constitutes a \n\u201cfinal order of the Commission made reviewable by Sec-\ntion 402(a)\u201d of Title 47.  Id. at 8a-9a.  The court based \n\n7 \n \nthat conclusion on circuit precedent and on an FCC reg-\nulation stating that Bureau orders are generally effec-\ntive upon release.  See id. at 7a-8a & n.1.  Accordingly, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the district court \nlacked authority to \u201cdisagree[] with Amerifactors\u201d by \nimposing TCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited \nfaxes sent to online fax services.  Id. at 9a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars district \ncourts from entertaining collateral attacks on covered \nagency actions in litigation between private parties.   \nA.  As an initial matter, this case comes to the Court \nbased on an erroneous premise.  The courts below viewed \nAmerifactors as a \u201cfinal order of the [FCC] made re-\nviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  \nBut Amerifactors was issued by a bureau of the FCC on \ndelegated authority, and an application for Commission \nreview of the order remains pending.  Because the Com-\nmission\u2019s disposition of the pending application is a \n\u201ccondition precedent\u201d to judicial review, 47 U.S.C. \n155(c)(7), Amerifactors has never been susceptible to \ndirect court-of-appeals review, and the exclusivity pro-\nvision does not apply to it. \nB.  If the Court assumes for purposes of this case \nthat Amerifactors is a final order to which the Hobbs \nAct applies, the judgment below should be affirmed. \nThe Hobbs Act vests courts of appeals with \u201cexclu-\nsive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of covered \nagency actions.  28 U.S.C. 2342.  A court \u201cdetermine[s]\u201d \nan action\u2019s \u201cvalidity\u201d when it resolves a dispute about \nwhether the action is sound or lawful.  Ibid.  The plain \nlanguage of the statute therefore encompasses the situ-\nation in which a party to private litigation asks the court \nto adopt an interpretation of a statute that a covered \n\n8 \n \nagency order rejects.  Consistent with the statutory \ntext, this Court has previously construed the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s exclusivity provision to bar a collateral attack on \nan agency action in a district-court damages suit be-\ntween private parties.  See Port of Boston Marine Ter-\nminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 \nU.S. 62, 69-72 (1970). \nThe statutory history confirms the clear import of \nthe text.  Congress derived the relevant language from \nthe Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, ch. 26, 56 \nStat. 23, after this Court had construed that statute to \nbar collateral attacks on covered agency actions even in \nenforcement proceedings.  Yakus v. United States, 321 \nU.S. 414, 429-430 (1944).  The Hobbs Act operates the \nsame way.  That understanding is further supported by \nthis Court\u2019s precedent interpreting the pre-Hobbs Act \nstatutory scheme for judicial review of FCC orders. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act would \nundermine its purposes and structure.  The Act is de-\nsigned to achieve certainty and finality by providing a \ncentralized forum for judicial review of covered agency \nactions, in which the presence of the United States as a \nparty is ensured.  Allowing litigants to collaterally attack \ncovered agency actions in private district-court litigation \nwould disserve those interests. \nC.  Any presumption of judicial review does not help \npetitioner because the Hobbs Act provides for review in \nan Article III court.  Similarly, while 5 U.S.C. 703 es-\ntablishes a general rule that agency action may be chal-\nlenged during enforcement suits, that rule does not ap-\nply where a \u201cprior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity \nfor judicial review is provided by law.\u201d  Ibid.  The other \nstatutes to which petitioner seeks to compare the Hobbs \n\n9 \n \nAct contain materially different language.  And the \ncanon of constitutional avoidance does not apply here. \nD.  Petitioner contends in the alternative that the \nHobbs Act at least does not prevent district courts from \nadjudicating collateral attacks on interpretive rules or \nguidance documents.  Amerifactors is a declaratory or-\nder, not a rule.  In any event, the Hobbs Act contains no \nexception for interpretive agency actions.  Where an in-\nterpretive rule or order is reviewable by a court of ap-\npeals under the Hobbs Act, district courts lack author-\nity to determine the action\u2019s validity. \nARGUMENT \nTHE HOBBS ACT BARS COLLATERAL ATTACKS ON THE \nVALIDITY OF A COVERED FCC ORDER IN DISTRICT-\nCOURT LITIGATION BETWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES \nThe Hobbs Act vests courts of appeals with \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d specified cat-\negories of agency actions, including certain \u201cfinal orders \nof the\u201d FCC.  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  The decision below rests \non the premise that, for purposes of the Hobbs Act, the \nAmerifactors order issued in 2019 by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau is a \u201cfinal or-\nder[] of the\u201d Commission that is \u201cmade reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 7a-8a.   \nAlthough petitioner does not contest that premise, it is \nincorrect.  But accepting that premise for purposes of \nthis case, the judgment below should be affirmed. \nUnder the Hobbs Act\u2019s jurisdiction-channeling pro-\nvision, covered agency actions may not be collaterally \nattacked in district court, including in litigation be-\ntween private parties.  Accordingly, if Amerifactors is \ntreated as a final FCC order subject to Hobbs Act re-\nview in a court of appeals, the district court correctly \nconcluded that it lacked authority to impose liability on \n\n10 \n \nrespondents for conduct that does not violate the TCPA \nas interpreted in Amerifactors. \nA. The Decision Below Rests On An Incorrect Premise \nThe court of appeals erred in treating the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order as a \u201cfinal order[] of the Commis-\nsion\u201d that is \u201cmade reviewable by section 402(a) of title \n47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1); see Pet. App. 8a-9a.  The FCC \nmay delegate certain functions to \u201can employee board\u201d \nwithin the agency, such as the Bureau.  47 U.S.C. \n155(c)(1).  An order issued \u201cpursuant to any such dele-\ngation  * * *  shall have the same force and effect\u201d as an \norder by the Commission \u201cunless\u201d it is \u201creviewed\u201d by \nthe Commission, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(3), which may do so \nsua sponte or upon the filing of an application for re-\nview, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4).  Filing an application for Com-\nmission review is \u201ca condition precedent to judicial re-\nview of any order  * * *  made\u201d pursuant to a delegation \nof authority from the Commission.  47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7). \nAlthough the statutory text makes the \u201cfiling\u201d of an \napplication for review a prerequisite to judicial review, \n47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7), the courts of appeals have correctly \nunderstood that provision to mean that the aggrieved \nperson must \u201cawait the Commission\u2019s disposition\u201d of \nthe application before seeking judicial review.  Interna-\ntional Telecard Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 166 F.3d 387, 388 (D.C. \nCir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1146 (1999); \nsee, e.g., Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 937 (2003); \nCellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC, 205 F.3d 82, 88-89 (2d \nCir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1070 (2001).  Accord-\ningly, a petition for review is \u201cincurably premature\u201d if \nthe petition seeks judicial review of an order issued on \ndelegated authority while an application for review of \n\n11 \n \nthat order remains pending before the Commission.  In-\nternational Telecard, 166 F.3d at 388. \nHere, a statutory \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to judicial re-\nview of Amerifactors under 47 U.S.C. 402(a)\u2014the Com-\nmission\u2019s disposition of the pending application for re-\nview of the Bureau\u2019s order\u2014remains unfulfilled.  47 \nU.S.C. 155(c)(7); see p. 5, supra.  Amerifactors is there-\nfore not presently a \u201cfinal order[] of the [FCC] made \nreviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2342(1); see 47 U.S.C. 402(a).  The Hobbs Act does not \ncurrently authorize any court of appeals to review \nAmerifactors, nor does it preclude district courts from \ndetermining that order\u2019s validity.1 \nIn PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiro-\npractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the Court stated that it \nwould \u201cassume without deciding\u201d that the FCC action \nat issue there was \u201ca \u2018final order\u2019\u200a\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  \nId. at 6.  Finality had not been disputed in that case.  \nSee ibid.  By contrast, petitioner argued below that \nAmerifactors is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d for purposes of the \nHobbs Act, but the court of appeals rejected that argu-\nment, see pp. 6-7, supra, and petitioner did not seek this \nCourt\u2019s review of that holding.  Given petitioner\u2019s litiga-\ntion choice and this Court\u2019s grant of certiorari, the \n \n1 The situation would be different if the time for filing an applica-\ntion for Commission review of Amerifactors had expired without \nany aggrieved person filing such an application.  In those circum-\nstances, the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision would apply because \nAmerifactors would be properly treated as a \u201cfinal order[] of the \n[FCC] made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47,\u201d even though \nno party took the necessary steps to perfect such review.  28 U.S.C. \n2342(1).  Applying the exclusivity provision in those circumstances \nwould be no different from applying it when judicial review under \nthe Hobbs Act is available for an agency action but no party seeks \nreview within the 60-day period prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 2344. \n\n12 \n \nCourt may assume for purposes of this case that the \nAmerifactors order is covered by Section 2342(1) and \ntherefore could have been challenged directly in a court \nof appeals through the Hobbs Act\u2019s review mechanism. \nB. The Hobbs Act Provides The Exclusive Mechanism For  \nObtaining Judicial Review Of Covered Agency Orders \nAssuming that the Amerifactors order could have \nbeen challenged in a court of appeals under the Hobbs \nAct, the Act bars petitioner from pursuing a claim of \nprivate TCPA liability that is inconsistent with that or-\nder.  The Hobbs Act\u2019s text forecloses such collateral at-\ntacks, and the statute\u2019s history and purposes confirm \nthe clear import of the statutory language. \n1. The Hobbs Act\u2019s plain language precludes district-\ncourt review of agency actions covered by 28 U.S.C. \n2342 \na. The Hobbs Act gives courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction  * * *  to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d specified \ncategories of agency action.  28 U.S.C. 2342.  To \u201cdeter-\nmine\u201d an issue means \u201c[t]o settle a question or contro-\nversy about\u201d it or \u201cto decide [it] by authoritative or  \njudicial sentence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 711 (2d ed. 1958) \n(Webster\u2019s Second); see 4 The Oxford English Diction-\nary 550 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\u201cTo settle or decide (a dis-\npute, question, matter in debate) as a judge or arbi-\nter.\u201d).  The term \u201cvalidity\u201d refers in this context to hav-\ning \u201c[l]egal strength, force, or authority\u201d or to being \n\u201cgrounded\u201d in \u201csound principles.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Second \n2814; accord 19 OED 410; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1870 \n(12th ed. 2024); 3 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary and Con-\ncise Encyclopedia 3387 (3d rev. 8th ed. 1914).  The \nHobbs Act thus gives the courts of appeals exclusive au-\n\n13 \n \nthority to decide any question about the lawfulness of a \ncovered agency action. \nPetitioner accepts that determining the validity of an \nagency order means deciding \u201cwhether the order has \n\u2018legal force\u2019 or is \u2018effective or binding.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. Br. 21.  Pe-\ntitioner maintains, however, that a court makes such a \ndetermination \u201conly by entering a declaratory judg-\nment that the order is valid or invalid.\u201d  Id. at 22 (quot-\ning PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21 (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)).  Entering a judgment declar-\ning an agency action to be invalid (or valid) is surely one \nmeans of determining the validity of that action.  But \npetitioner identifies no dictionary, treatise, or other \nsource that defines the words \u201cdetermine\u201d or \u201cvalidity\u201d \nas referring exclusively to the entry of a declaratory \njudgment. \nA court that finds an agency\u2019s order to be incon-\nsistent with a statute, and therefore disregards the or-\nder in adjudicating one private party\u2019s liability to an-\nother, is naturally said to \u201cdetermine\u201d the order\u2019s \u201cva-\nlidity.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342.  It likewise would be natural to \nsay that in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 \n(1803), this Court determined the validity of the statute \nthat purported to grant the Court original jurisdiction \nover mandamus petitions.  The Court held that the stat-\nute was unconstitutional, declined to give it effect, and \nthen dismissed the proceeding for want of appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  See id. at 173-180.  Entry of an injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment will sometimes be an appropriate \nremedial step after the court has determined whether \nan agency action is lawful.  But whenever a court de-\ncides whether an agency action is lawful or unlawful in \nthe course of resolving a case before it, the court is \u201cde-\ntermin[ing] the validity of\u200a\u201d that action. \n\n14 \n \nPetitioner suggests that it did not ask the district \ncourt to determine the validity of Amerifactors because \nthe judgment that petitioner sought would have left the \nagency free to \u201cenforce the order against others.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 20 (quoting PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21 (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment)).  But that \nwould be equally true for a declaratory judgment issued \nby a district court, which would bind only the parties.  \nSee United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 162-163 \n(1984) (federal government is not subject to nonmutual \ncollateral estoppel).  Indeed, under petitioner\u2019s ap-\nproach, a court of appeals that upheld a covered agency \naction on direct Hobbs Act review would not \u201cdetermine \n[the action\u2019s] validity,\u201d since petitioner views such court \nof appeals decisions as binding only on the parties.  See \nPet. Br. 31 n.6. \nb. Petitioner argues that, under the interpretive \nprinciple noscitur a sociis, the terms \u201c\u200a\u2018enjoin,\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201c\u200a\u2018sus-\npend,\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018set aside\u2019\u200a\u201d all refer \u201cto specific kinds of \nequitable relief,\u201d and that \u201c\u200a\u2018determine the validity\u2019 is \nbest read to do the same.\u201d  Pet. Br. 22-23 (citations omit-\nted); see 28 U.S.C. 2342 (\u201cto enjoin, set aside, suspend \n(in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d).  \nBut noscitur a sociis has \u201cno place, as this Court has \nmany times held, except in the domain of ambiguity.\u201d  \nRussell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, \n519 (1923); see United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, \n474-475 (2010).  The phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d \nunambiguously encompasses deciding the lawfulness of \nan agency order in the course of resolving a dispute be-\ntween private parties. \nPetitioner\u2019s understanding of the surrounding text is \nalso incorrect.  Petitioner assumes that to \u201c[s]et aside\u201d \nan agency order must mean to \u201cannul or vacate\u201d it.  Pet. \n\n15 \n \nBr. 23 (citation omitted).  But as three Members of this \nCourt recently recognized in assessing a court\u2019s author-\nity to \u201cset aside\u201d agency action under 5 U.S.C. 706(2) (a \nprovision originally enacted in the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act (APA), ch. 324, \u00a7 10(e), 60 Stat. 243, four \nyears before Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, see p. 2, \nsupra), that language permits a reviewing court to \u201c\u200a\u2018set \naside\u2019\u200a\u201d agency action by \u201c\u200a\u2018disregard[ing]\u2019\u200a\u201d the action as \nunlawful and resolving the dispute before the court \nwithout the agency action figuring into the \u201cdecisional \nprocess.\u201d  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 696 \n(2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the judgment).2 \nIn any event, the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d \nshould be given its natural meaning, however the Court \nconstrues the separate phrase \u201cset aside.\u201d  Contrary to \npetitioner\u2019s suggestion (Br. 24), reading Section 2342 in \nthat way would not render any of its language \u201csuper-\nfluous.\u201d  A court might be asked to \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d \nor \u201csuspend\u201d a covered agency action without conclu-\nsively determining its validity\u2014for example, when a \nparty seeks a preliminary injunction.  Congress there-\nfore had good reason to include the complete set of \nterms that appears in Section 2342. \nc. The inference that \u201cdetermin[ing]  * * *  validity\u201d \nunder Section 2342 does not refer exclusively to enter-\ning declaratory judgments is bolstered by a comparison \nto 28 U.S.C. 2349(a).  Section 2349(a) states that, when \n \n2 Section 703 of Title 5 contemplates that \u201cjudicial review\u201d of \nagency action may occur in an enforcement proceeding (see p. 26, \ninfra), and Section 706 indicates that a reviewing court may \u201cset \naside\u201d agency action.  5 U.S.C. 703, 706(2).  Taken together, those \nprovisions reinforce the conclusion that a court can \u201cset aside\u201d an \nagency action by disregarding the action as unlawful in the course \nof adjudicating an enforcement suit. \n\n16 \n \na Hobbs Act suit is filed, the court of appeals \u201chas juris-\ndiction to vacate stay orders or interlocutory injunc-\ntions\u201d and \u201cto make and enter, on the petition, evidence, \nand proceedings set forth in the record on review, a \njudgment determining the validity of, and enjoining, \nsetting aside, or suspending, in whole or in part, the or-\nder of the agency.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added). \nPetitioner contends (Br. 25) that Section 2349(a) \n\u201cconfirm[s] that Congress intended the determination \nof an order\u2019s validity to be an equitable remedy awarded \nthrough a declaratory \u2018\u200ajudgment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  But the word \n\u201c\u200ajudgment\u201d appears only in Section 2349(a), not Section \n2342, and its omission from the latter was presumably \ndeliberate and should be given effect.  See Russello v. \nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983).  Section 2349 de-\nlineates the jurisdiction and powers of the reviewing \ncourt when a party properly invokes the Hobbs Act to \nseek direct judicial review of a covered agency action, \nwith the United States named as a party.  By contrast, \nSection 2342\u2019s exclusivity provision forecloses judicial \nreview of covered agency actions outside of the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s review scheme.  And rather than stating that \ncourts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to enter \u201ca \njudgment determining the validity of\u200a\u201d a covered agency \norder, 28 U.S.C. 2349(a), Section 2342 states more \nbroadly that those courts have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto \ndetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d covered orders, 28 U.S.C. \n2342.  Petitioner disregards that textual difference. \n2. This Court has construed the Hobbs Act to bar parties \nin private district-court litigation from collaterally \nattacking covered agency action \nIn Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Reder-\niaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62 (1970) (Trans-\natlantic), vessel owners refused to pay certain cargo \n\n17 \n \nfees, asserting that the absence of pre-approval by the \nFederal Maritime Commission (FMC) rendered the \nfees invalid.  Id. at 64-65.  The port operator brought \nsuit for damages and declaratory relief against a vessel-\nowner organization.  Ibid.  The district court stayed the \nproceedings to allow the parties to obtain a ruling from \nthe FMC, which concluded that the fees were largely \nvalid because they had not required pre-approval.  Id. \nat 65-66.  An affected carrier then moved to intervene \nin the damages action on the ground that the carrier \nwould be liable for part of any judgment.  Id. at 67.  The \ncourt granted leave to intervene, but it refused to con-\nsider the carrier\u2019s argument\u2014raised as a defense to po-\ntential civil liability\u2014that the FMC had erred in deem-\ning the tariff revisions valid.  Ibid. \nThis Court unanimously agreed that the district \ncourt \u201cwas without authority\u201d to consider the carrier\u2019s \nattack on the FMC\u2019s action.  Transatlantic, 400 U.S. at \n69.  The Court grounded that holding in the Hobbs Act\u2019s \nexclusivity provision, explaining that the Act \u201cis ex-\nplicit\u201d in vesting the courts of appeals with \u201c\u200a\u2018exclusive \njurisdiction to  . . .  determine the validity of  . . .  such \nfinal orders of the [FMC].\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting 28 U.S.C. \n2342).  The Court explained that an exception for cases \ninvolving referrals to the FMC \u201cwould vitiate the \nscheme of the [Hobbs Act]\u2014a scheme designed to en-\nsure that the Attorney General has an opportunity to \nrepresent the interest of the Government whenever an \norder of one of the specified agencies is reviewed.\u201d  Id. \nat 70. \nThis Court also rejected the carrier\u2019s argument that \nit should be permitted to mount \u201ca collateral attack on \nthe Commission\u2019s order\u201d because the carrier had not \nbeen a party to the FMC proceedings.  Transatlantic, \n\n18 \n \n400 U.S. at 71.  The Court explained that the carrier was \nin fact \u201crepresented before the Commission and ha[d] \npreviously made numerous claims to party status.\u201d  \nIbid.  The Court also observed that, \u201c[e]ven if [the car-\nrier] was not a formal party\u201d to the administrative pro-\nceeding, its \u201cinterests were clearly at stake,\u201d and its \nlack of party status did not justify allowing a \u201ccollateral \nredetermination of the same issue in a different and in-\nappropriate forum.\u201d  Id. at 72.  The Court also noted \nthat the carrier \u201chad every opportunity to participate \nbefore the Commission and then to seek timely review\u201d \nvia the Hobbs Act but \u201cchose not to do so.\u201d  Ibid. \nIn accordance with Transatlantic, every court of ap-\npeals to address the issue has construed the Hobbs Act \nto bar courts from determining the validity of covered \nagency actions in any proceeding outside the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s channels.  The courts of appeals have applied the \nHobbs Act to preclude challenges to agency regulations \nin suits between private parties, e.g., Mais v. Gulf Coast \nCollection Bureau, Inc., 768 F.3d 1110, 1119-1121 (11th \nCir. 2014); Leyse v. Clear Channel Broad., Inc., 545 \nFed. Appx. 444, 459 (6th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 574 \nU.S. 815 (2014); Nack v. Walburg, 715 F.3d 680, 685-687 \n(8th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1028 (2014); CE \nDesign, Ltd. v. Prism Bus. Media, Inc., 606 F.3d 443, \n447-448 (7th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 1138 \n(2011); Daniels v. Union Pac. R.R., 530 F.3d 936, 940-\n941 (D.C. Cir. 2008); City of Peoria v. General Elec. Ca-\nblevision Corp., 690 F.2d 116, 119-121 (7th Cir. 1982), \nand to preclude the assertion of such challenges as de-\nfenses to civil enforcement actions brought by the gov-\nernment, e.g., United States v. Dunifer, 219 F.3d 1004, \n1007 (9th Cir. 2000); United States v. Any & All Radio \n\n19 \n \nStation Transmission Equip., 207 F.3d 458, 463 (8th \nCir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1071 (2001). \n3. The history of the Hobbs Act and its predecessors  \nreinforces the most natural reading of Section 2342\u2019s \ntext \na. The Hobbs Act\u2019s language vesting the courts of \nappeals with \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u200a\u201d covered orders derives from the Emergency \nPrice Control Act of 1942 (EPCA), ch. 26, 56 Stat. 23.  \nUnder the EPCA, a party that wished to challenge  \norders fixing maximum prices and rents was required \nto file a protest with a federal administrator\u2014and, \nwhen the statute was enacted, to do so within 60 days.   \n\u00a7 203(a), 56 Stat. 31.  An aggrieved party could then ap-\npeal to a special Article III court, called the Emergency \nCourt of Appeals.  \u00a7 204, 56 Stat. 31-33.  The EPCA \nvested the Emergency Court with \u201cexclusive jurisdic-\ntion to determine the validity\u201d of regulations, orders, \nand price schedules issued under the Act.  \u00a7 204(d), 56 \nStat. 33.  The statute also stated that, \u201c[e]xcept as pro-\nvided in [the EPCA], no court, Federal, State, or Terri-\ntorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the \nvalidity of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, \nor to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside, in whole or in \npart,  * * *  any provision of any such regulation, order, \nor price schedule.\u201d  Ibid. \nThis Court construed the EPCA\u2019s exclusivity provi-\nsion to bar other courts from determining the validity \nof covered orders in all types of litigation, including en-\nforcement suits.  In Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. \n414 (1944), the Court held that the statute divested dis-\ntrict courts of \u201cpower to consider the validity of a price \nregulation as a defense to a criminal prosecution for its \nviolation.\u201d  Id. at 429; see id. at 430.  The Court similarly \n\n20 \n \nfound \u201cno doubt\u201d that the EPCA barred a district court \n\u201cfrom determining the validity of [an] individual rent \norder\u201d in a civil enforcement suit against a landlord to \nrecover allegedly excessive rents, \u201ceven though the de-\nfense to the action brought there was based on the al-\nleged invalidity of the order.\u201d  Woods v. Hills, 334 U.S. \n210, 213-214 (1948). \nWhen language is \u201cobviously transplanted from an-\nother legal source, whether the common law or other \nlegislation, it brings the old soil with it.\u201d  Stokeling v. \nUnited States, 586 U.S. 73, 80 (2019) (citation omitted).  \nBy incorporating EPCA language that this Court had \nauthoritatively construed, Congress signaled its intent \nthat the Hobbs Act\u2019s grant of \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \n\u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of specified agency actions \nshould be understood in a like manner. \nb. Petitioner contends (Br. 34) that the old-soil prin-\nciple does not apply here because the EPCA contained \ntwo sentences regarding exclusivity, Yakus rested on \nboth of them together, and the Hobbs Act incorporates \nlanguage from only one of the sentences.  Those conten-\ntions are unsound. \nAs petitioner observes, the EPCA provided in two con-\nsecutive sentences (1) that the Emergency Court estab-\nlished by the Act \u201cshall have exclusive jurisdiction to  \ndetermine the validity\u201d of the covered agency actions and \n(2) that no other court \u201cshall have jurisdiction or power  \nto consider the validity of any such\u201d action.  \u00a7 204(d), 56 \nStat. 33.  In Yakus, this Court quoted the first sentence \nand observed that, \u201ccoupled\u201d with the second, the pro-\nvisions were \u201cbroad enough in terms to deprive the dis-\ntrict court of power to consider the validity of\u200a\u201d the chal-\nlenged regulation.  321 U.S. at 430.  But the Court\u2019s ob-\nservation that the two sentences together were \u201cbroad \n\n21 \n \nenough,\u201d ibid., does not suggest that either standing \nalone would have been insufficient.  Those sentences \nmerely stated two sides of the same coin:  One granted \nthe Emergency Court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction,\u201d and the \nother made explicit the necessary implication of that ex-\nclusivity for other modes of review.  EPCA \u00a7 204(d), 56 \nStat. 33.  Petitioner observes that the first sentence re-\nferred to \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d validity while the second re-\nferred to \u201cconsider[ing]\u201d validity.  Pet. Br. 34 (citations \nand emphasis omitted).  But this Court in Yakus did not \nsuggest any salient distinction between those terms, \nand petitioner does not identify one. \nPetitioner is also wrong to suggest (Br. 34) that the \nHobbs Act incorporates language only from the first \nEPCA sentence.  The second EPCA sentence (but not \nthe first) stated that no court other than the Emergency \nCourt could \u201cstay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside\u201d covered \nagency action.  EPCA \u00a7 204(d), 56 Stat. 33.  Congress \nincluded similar language in the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity \nprovision.  See 28 U.S.C. 2342.  Section 2342 thus incor-\nporates language from each of the two EPCA sentences \nthat the Yakus Court viewed as collectively precluding \ndistrict-court review. \nThe APA\u2019s text and history point in the same direc-\ntion.  As enacted in 1946, the APA stated that agency \naction \u201cshall be subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement except to \nthe extent that prior, adequate, and exclusive oppor-\ntunity for such review is provided by law.\u201d  \u00a7 10(b), 60 \nStat. 243; see 5 U.S.C. 703.  That provision is widely un-\nderstood to have been added to the APA \u201cto account for \nthe possible reappearance\u201d of judicial-review schemes \nsimilar to the EPCA\u2019s.  Paul R. Verkuil, Congressional \nLimitations on Judicial Review of Rules, 57 Tulane L. \n\n22 \n \nRev. 733, 741 n.34 (1983) (Verkuil) (citing U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act 99 (1947) (APA Manual)).  And \nin addressing the kind of preclusion that had been ac-\ncomplished by the EPCA and recognized in Yakus, Con-\ngress referred to laws that provide an \u201cexclusive oppor-\ntunity for [\u200ajudicial] review.\u201d  APA \u00a7 10(b), 60 Stat. 243. \nThat APA language harkens back to the first of the \nEPCA\u2019s exclusivity sentences rather than the second, \nwhich did not use the term \u201cexclusive.\u201d  Section 703 thus \nindicates that a law (like the Hobbs Act, see 28 U.S.C. \n2342) that designates some other mode of review as \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d will preclude \u201cjudicial review in civil or criminal \nproceedings for judicial enforcement.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 703.3 \nc. This Court likewise construed the pre-Hobbs Act \nscheme for judicial review of FCC orders as precluding \ncourts in suits between private parties from determin-\ning whether covered agency orders were lawful.  The \nUrgent Deficiencies Act (see pp. 2-3, supra) conferred \non specially constituted district courts \u201cexclusive juris-\ndiction\u201d over suits to \u201cenjoin, set aside, annul, or sus-\npend\u201d specified agency orders.  Act of June 18, 1910, ch. \n309, 36 Stat. 539-540 (vesting that jurisdiction in a spe-\ncial commerce court); see Urgent Deficiencies Act, 38 \nStat. 219-220 (abolishing the commerce court and trans-\nferring its jurisdiction to three-judge district courts); \nsee also 28 U.S.C. 44-48 (1934); Communications Act of \n1934, ch. 652, \u00a7 402(a), 48 Stat. 1093. \n \n3 Petitioner is wrong in suggesting (Br. 34-35) that the APA Man-\nual identified the second EPCA sentence as the key statutory lan-\nguage.  See APA Manual 99 & n.13 (stating that a \u201cstatute may  \n* * *  expressly provide for an exclusive method of judicial review \nwhich precludes challenge of agency action in enforcement proceed-\nings,\u201d and citing as an example \u201csection 204(d) of the [EPCA]\u201d). \n\n23 \n \nIn applying that exclusive-jurisdiction provision, this \nCourt focused on the practical effects of particular  \nsuits.  In Venner v. Michigan Central Railroad, 271 \nU.S. 127 (1926), the Court explained that a suit was sub-\nject to the exclusive-jurisdiction provision, even if it did \n\u201cnot expressly pray that [a covered] order be annulled \nor set aside,\u201d if the suit \u201cassail[ed] the validity of the \norder and pray[ed] that the defendant company be en-\njoined from doing what the order specifically author-\nizes, which is equivalent to asking that the order be ad-\njudged invalid and set aside.\u201d  Id. at 130.  Accordingly, \na shareholder in a railroad could not bring a suit against \nthe railroad outside the channels of Urgent Deficiencies \nAct review when the shareholder sought to enjoin the \nrailroad from carrying out an agreement that the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission (ICC) had approved.  Id. \nat 129.  In Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad, 258 U.S. 377 (1922), the Court similarly held \nthat a mining company\u2019s suit against a railroad to enjoin \nit from distributing coal cars constituted a suit to set \naside an ICC order that had already mandated the rel-\nevant coal-car schedule.  Id. at 381-382.  The Hobbs Act \nis best understood to operate with a similar focus on the \nsubstance of the suit, not just the relief requested.   \n4. The purpose and structure of the Hobbs Act confirm \nCongress\u2019s intent to preclude collateral attacks on \ncovered agency orders \nAdherence to the Hobbs Act\u2019s jurisdictional scheme \n\u201censure[s] that the Attorney General has an oppor-\ntunity to represent the interest of the Government \nwhenever an order of the specified agencies is re-\nviewed.\u201d  Transatlantic, 400 U.S. at 70; see 28 U.S.C. \n2344.  Here, as in Transatlantic, that aspect of the stat-\nutory design would be \u201cvitiate[d],\u201d 400 U.S. at 70, if par-\n\n24 \n \nties to private district-court litigation\u2014or, indeed, pri-\nvate litigation in the state courts\u2014could assert that cov-\nered agency orders are unlawful. \nPermitting such collateral challenges would under-\nmine the statutory scheme.  Many provisions governing \nHobbs Act review are designed to facilitate quick, na-\ntionwide resolution of disputes concerning the validity \nof covered agency actions.  These provisions establish a \n60-day filing deadline, mandate direct court-of-appeals \nreview, and provide for consolidation of multiple chal-\nlenges in a single court of appeals.  The court of appeals \ncan then consider the lawfulness of the agency action in \nlight of the administrative record, and often with the \nparticipation of the full range of stakeholders who were \ninvolved in the agency proceedings.  Taken together, \nthose procedures enable private entities, in structuring \ntheir operations, to act in reliance on an agency order \nonce a court of appeals has found it to be valid or the \ntime for seeking review has expired.   \nIn the TCPA context, the Hobbs Act ensures that \nbusinesses engaged in telemarketing can avoid liability \nin private TCPA suits by relying on safe harbors de-\nfined by the FCC.  Acceptance of petitioner\u2019s position \nwould render such safe harbors illusory.  Petitioner\u2019s \nown suit involves a Bureau order that is not presently a \nfinal order directly reviewable under the Hobbs Act.  \nSee pp. 10-11, supra.  But under petitioner\u2019s approach, \na regulated party could be held liable for conduct that a \nCommission order declares to be permissible under the \nTCPA, even after a court of appeals has upheld the per-\ntinent FCC order or the time for seeking Hobbs Act re-\nview has expired. \nPetitioner observes that under its interpretation the \nHobbs Act would still channel \u201cfacial, pre-enforcement \n\n25 \n \nchallenges\u201d to the courts of appeals.  Pet. Br. 25 (quoting \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 13 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring in the judgment)) (emphasis omitted).  Reading the \nAct to serve only that purpose would be a mistake.  Col-\nlateral attacks in enforcement actions, particularly  \nprivate suits, can likewise undermine the finality and \ncertainty that the Hobbs Act is designed to create\u2014 \nincluding for potential defendants who rely in good faith \non covered agency orders to structure their business af-\nfairs.  See Resp. Br. 33-35. \nC. Petitioner\u2019s Remaining Arguments Lack Merit \nPetitioner does not identify any presumptions, back-\nground rules, or substantive canons that would justify \nits narrow construction of the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity \nprovision. \n1. The question presented here does not implicate \nany \u201c\u200a\u2018strong presumption\u2019 favoring judicial review.\u201d  \nPet. Br. 28 (citation omitted).  The presumption that \n\u201cCongress intends judicial review of administrative ac-\ntion,\u201d Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physi-\ncians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986), comes into play only \nwhen one potential reading of a statute would insulate \nparticular agency action from all judicial review.  That \nis not the case here, since the Hobbs Act simply privi-\nleges one centralized forum for judicial review of cov-\nered agency actions.  And petitioner asks the Court to \ndecide this case on the understanding that petitioner \nhad a prior adequate opportunity to seek Hobbs Act re-\nview of the Board\u2019s Amerifactors order in a court of ap-\npeals.  See Pet. Cert. Reply Br. 4 (noting that petitioner \n\u201cnever argued that it lacked a prior or adequate oppor-\ntunity for review under the Hobbs Act\u201d).  Accordingly, \n\u201cthis case does not implicate \u2018the strong presumption \nthat Congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial re-\n\n26 \n \nview.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n207 n.8 (1994) (citations omitted).   \n2. Because the Hobbs Act \u201cprovide[s] by law\u201d for a \n\u201cprior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial \nreview\u201d of covered agency actions, 5 U.S.C. 703, Section \n703 by its terms indicates that such actions are not sub-\nject to review in enforcement proceedings.  The concept \nof \u201cadequacy\u201d in Section 703 derives from this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Yakus.  See pp. 19-21, supra (discussing Ya-\nkus); see also Verkuil 741 n.34 (explaining that Section \n703 \u201cincorporates the \u2018adequacy\u2019 standard of Yakus\u201d); \ncf. APA Manual 97-98 (observing that the \u201cadequate\u201d \nlimitation codified existing law).  The Court had held in \nYakus that foreclosing judicial review in enforcement \nproceedings does not violate due process as long as the \ndefendants had previously received an \u201cadequate\u201d op-\nportunity to challenge the relevant agency order.  321 \nU.S. at 434, 436-437.  Congress incorporated the same \nsafeguard, using the same term, when it enacted the \nAPA four years later.  APA \u00a7 10(b), 60 Stat. 243 (\u201cprior, \nadequate, and exclusive opportunity\u201d). \nAs Yakus illustrates, an exclusive review scheme may \nprovide an \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity for judicial review \neven where a particular litigant has failed to invoke that \nscheme.  See Yakus, 321 U.S. at 433-435 & n.3.  Peti-\ntioner\u2019s only proffered reason for reading Section 703 to \npreserve judicial review of covered FCC orders in pri-\nvate TCPA suits is that the Hobbs Act is \u201c\u200a\u2018exclusive\u2019\u200a\u201d of \ndistrict-court review only when the plaintiff seeks \u201c\u200a\u2018an \ninjunction or declaratory judgment regarding the \nagency\u2019s order\u2019 in a pre-enforcement facial challenge.\u201d  \nPet. Br. 29 n.5 (citations omitted).  If the Court rejects \nthat reading of the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision, \nthen Section 703 adds nothing to petitioner\u2019s arguments. \n\n27 \n \n3. Petitioner observes (Br. 31-32) that certain other \nagency-review statutes channel pre-enforcement chal-\nlenges to appellate courts while also permitting chal-\nlenges to be raised in enforcement suits.  But petitioner \ndoes not identify any example of such a statute that de-\nscribes the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction as \u201cexclusive.\u201d  \nPetitioner\u2019s discussion (Br. 32) of judicial review of \nrules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion does not fill that gap.  Contrary to petitioner\u2019s sug-\ngestion (ibid.), the Hobbs Act does not govern review of \nsuch rules, and the statute that does apply is worded \ndifferently.  See 15 U.S.C. 78y. \nPetitioner also invokes (Br. 32-33) other statutes \nthat more specifically foreclose collateral attacks on the \nvalidity of agency orders in enforcement litigation.  As \npetitioner points out, some provisions state that covered \nagency actions \u201cshall not be subject to judicial review in \nany civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 33 (quoting PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 14 (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment), in turn quot-\ning 33 U.S.C. 1369(b)(2)).  \u201cBut the mere possibility of \nclearer phrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading \nof a statute.\u201d  Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Novo \nNordisk A/S, 566 U.S. 399, 416 (2012).  Congress en-\nacted the Hobbs Act more than a decade before it en-\nacted any of those provisions.  Well before the Hobbs \nAct was enacted, moreover, the Court in Venner had \nheld that the Urgent Deficiencies Act\u2019s conferral of ex-\nclusive jurisdiction foreclosed collateral challenges in \nlitigation between private parties.  271 U.S. at 130; see \np. 23, supra.  The fact that more recent Congresses have \nforeclosed collateral challenges through differently \nworded provisions\u2014none of which includes the term \n\n28 \n \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d\u2014does not cast doubt on the \nproper interpretation of the Hobbs Act. \n4. Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Br. 35-37) on constitutional-\navoidance principles is also misplaced.  The rule that \nconstitutional difficulties should be avoided where pos-\nsible \u201cdoes not give a court the authority to rewrite a \nstatute,\u201d but simply permits a court to \u201c\u200a\u2018choose between \ncompeting plausible interpretations of a statutory \ntext.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 298 (2018) \n(brackets, citation, and emphasis omitted).  Given its \nlanguage, the history of its operative terms, and this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the Hobbs Act cannot plausibly be \nread to contain the limitation that petitioner advocates. \nIn any event, the reading of the Hobbs Act that the \nNinth Circuit adopted, and that respondents and the \ngovernment advocate here, raises no serious constitu-\ntional concern.  Due process \u201crequires the government \nto provide notice reasonably calculated, under all the \ncircumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pen-\ndency of the action and afford them an opportunity to \npresent their objections.\u201d  Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. \n220, 226 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Due process does not, however, require that \nlitigants be permitted to challenge an agency order at \nwhatever time, or in whatever forum, they prefer.  \nMoreover, litigants who wish to challenge a covered \nFCC order after the 60-day period for petitioning for \nHobbs Act review are not without recourse.  A person \nin those circumstances may petition the FCC for a new \ndeclaratory ruling, 47 C.F.R. 1.2, or ask the agency to \ninitiate a new rulemaking proceeding, 47 C.F.R. 1.401.  \nSee FCC v. ITT World Commc\u2019ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463, \n468 n.5 (1984); Any and All Radio Station, 207 F.3d at \n463; City of Peoria, 690 F.2d at 121. \n\n29 \n \nThe availability of judicial review also refutes peti-\ntioner\u2019s separation-of-powers argument (Br. 36-37).  \nThe Hobbs Act does not deny the federal judiciary the \npower to decide the legality of covered agency actions.  \nRather, the Act simply specifies review procedures to \npromote finality, uniformity, and judicial economy, and \nto ensure that orders are reviewed with the participa-\ntion of the government and on a developed administra-\ntive record.  \u201cThere is no constitutional requirement \nthat [a challenge] be made in one tribunal rather than \nin another, so long as there is an opportunity to be heard \nand for judicial review which satisfies the demands of \ndue process.\u201d  Yakus, 321 U.S. at 444; see United States \nv. Ruzicka, 329 U.S. 287, 292-294 (1946).  The separation \nof powers is likewise not offended when an Article III \ncourt is required to give preclusive effect to an agency\u2019s \nprior decision.  See B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis In-\ndus., Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 151 (2015). \nD. Amerifactors\u2019 Status As An Interpretation Of The TCPA \nDoes Not Render The Hobbs Act\u2019s Exclusive-Review \nProvision Inapplicable \nIn PDR Network, this Court remanded to allow the \ncourt of appeals to address, inter alia, whether the FCC \norder in that case should have been treated as the \n\u201cequivalent of an \u2018interpretive rule.\u2019\u200a\u201d  588 U.S. at 6-7.  \nThe Court viewed that inquiry as potentially bearing on \nthe \u201cextent to which the order binds the lower courts.\u201d  \nId. at 6.  Petitioner contends (Br. 37-42) that the Hobbs \nAct at least does not bar collateral attacks on interpre-\ntive rules or guidance, and that Amerifactors qualifies \nfor that putative \u201cinterpretive\u201d exception.  Those argu-\nments lack merit. \nThe interpretive/legislative distinction derives from \nthe APA\u2019s rulemaking requirements, which do not gov-\n\n30 \n \nern the promulgation of agency orders.  The APA ex-\nempts \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules from the notice, comment, \nand effective-date requirements for rulemaking under \n5 U.S.C. 553.  See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) and (d)(2).  The \nAPA does not use the term \u201clegislative rule,\u201d but that \nterm has come to describe rules that are not interpre-\ntative and therefore are ineligible for the notice-and-\ncomment exception.  See, e.g., Perez v. Mortgage Bank-\ners Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).  The APA prescribes \nseparate requirements and procedures for issuing an \nagency \u201corder,\u201d which by definition is the product of ad-\njudication rather than rulemaking.  See 5 U.S.C. 551(6) \nand (7) (defining \u201corder\u201d and \u201cadjudication\u201d). \nThe APA\u2019s adjudication provisions authorize agen-\ncies to issue \u201cdeclaratory order[s] to terminate a con-\ntroversy or remove uncertainty.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 554(e).  De-\nclaratory orders have \u201clike effect as in the case of other \norders.\u201d  Ibid.  They function similarly to declaratory \njudgments, allowing agencies to issue \u201cbinding rulings \ncapable of providing clear and certain guidance to reg-\nulated parties without requiring those parties to first \nact on peril of sanction.\u201d  Emily S. Bremer, Declaratory \nOrders: Final Report to the Administrative Conference \nof the United States 5 (Oct. 30, 2015).  The FCC\u2019s regu-\nlations specifically authorize the agency and its subor-\ndinate bureaus to issue such orders, which are known as \n\u201cdeclaratory rulings.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 1.2. \nHere, the Bureau issued Amerifactors in response to \na petition for a declaratory ruling, and the order states \nthat it is a \u201cdeclaratory ruling.\u201d  34 FCC Rcd at 11,950 \n\u00b6 3.  Petitioner identifies no reason to disregard that \ncharacterization.  Indeed, treating Amerifactors as an \norder rather than a rule was essential to an aspect of \nthe decision below that petitioner does not challenge:  It \n\n31 \n \nwas on that basis that the court of appeals treated \nAmerifactors as applying \u201cretroactively\u201d to faxes that \npredated the order.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIn any event, petitioner is wrong to suggest (Br. 39) \nthat the exclusivity of the Hobbs Act review mechanism \nturns on whether a particular agency action is better \ncharacterized as \u201cinterpretive\u201d or \u201clegislative.\u201d  As the \ngovernment acknowledged in PDR Network, that char-\nacterization may sometimes bear on whether a particu-\nlar agency action is reviewable in a court of appeals un-\nder the Hobbs Act scheme.  Oral Arg. Tr. 59, 64, PDR \nNetwork, supra (No. 17-1705); see, e.g., American \nTrucking Ass\u2019n v. United States, 755 F.2d 1292, 1296 \n(7th Cir. 1985) (agency report issued as an \u201ceducational \nundertaking\u201d was not subject to Hobbs Act review); cf. \nPet. Br. 41.  But the Hobbs Act does not otherwise pro-\nvide any \u201cexception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case law \ndoes not create one.\u201d  US West Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Ham-\nilton, 224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000); see, e.g., \nSorenson Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.3d 1215, 1223 \n(10th Cir. 2009) (Hobbs Act review of interpretive rule).  \nHere, petitioner specifically urged the Court to grant \ncertiorari and decide this case on the understanding \nthat Amerifactors could have been challenged in a court \nof appeals under the Hobbs Act review scheme.  See \nPet. Cert. Reply Br. 4.  When a particular agency action \nis reviewable by a court of appeals under the Hobbs Act, \nthe Act divests district courts of authority to \u201cdeter-\nmine [the action\u2019s] validity,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2342, regardless \nof whether the action is interpretive in character. \nPetitioner identifies no sound reason to except inter-\npretive rules from that exclusivity principle.  Even \napart from the absence of textual support for such an \nexception, the distinction between interpretive and leg-\n\n32 \n \nislative rules is not always easy to draw.  Cf. Mortgage \nBankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. at 96 (observing that the \u201cpre-\ncise meaning\u201d of the APA\u2019s reference to \u201cinterpretative \nrule[s]\u201d has been \u201cthe source of much scholarly and ju-\ndicial debate\u201d).  Petitioner suggests (Br. 40) that distin-\nguishing between the two types of rules is necessary to \navoid improperly giving interpretive rules the \u201cforce of \nlaw\u201d in district courts.  But to the extent the Hobbs Act \nprecludes a district court from finding an agency\u2019s in-\nterpretive rule to be unlawful, that bar is no different \nfrom requiring a district court to give preclusive effect \nto an agency adjudication, see, e.g., B&B Hardware, 575 \nU.S. at 148-149, or to reject an untimely challenge to an \nagency action.  Congress may limit the time and forum \nfor challenging an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, \nand the Hobbs Act imposes such limitations for agency \nactions covered by the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \naffirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \nP.

If no spe-\ncial statutory review proceeding is applicable, the action \nfor judicial review may be brought against the United \nStates, the agency by its official title, or the appropriate \nofficer.  Except to the extent that prior, adequate, and \nexclusive opportunity for judicial review is provided by \nlaw, agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement. \n \n2. \n5 U.S.C. 706 provides: \nScope of review \nTo the extent necessary to decision and when pre-\nsented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant \nquestions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory \nprovisions, and determine the meaning or applicability \nof the terms of an agency action.  The reviewing court \nshall\u2014 \n \n(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed; and \n \n(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be\u2014 \n\n2a \n \n \n(A) \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre-\ntion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; \n \n(B) \ncontrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity; \n \n(C) \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, au-\nthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \n \n(D) \nwithout observance of procedure re-\nquired by law; \n \n(E) \nunsupported by substantial evidence in a \ncase subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or \notherwise reviewed on the record of an agency \nhearing provided by statute; or \n \n(F) \nunwarranted by the facts to the extent \nthat the facts are subject to trial de novo by the \nreviewing court. \nIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall \nreview the whole record or those parts of it cited by a \nparty, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prej-\nudicial error. \n \n3. \n28 U.S.C. 2342 provides: \nJurisdiction of court of appeals \nThe court of appeals (other than the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) has exclusive \njurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in \npart), or to determine the validity of\u2014 \n \n(1) all final orders of the Federal Communica-\ntion Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) \nof title 47; \n\n3a \n \n \n(2) all final orders of the Secretary of Agricul-\nture made under chapters 9 and 20A of title 7, except \norders issued under sections 210(e), 217a, and \n499g(a) of title 7; \n \n(3) all rules, regulations, or final orders of\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe Secretary of Transportation issued \npursuant to section 50501, 50502, 56101-56104, or \n57109 of title 46 or pursuant to part B or C of sub-\ntitle IV, subchapter III of chapter 311, chapter \n313, or chapter 315 of title 49; and \n \n(B) \nthe Federal Maritime Commission issued \npursuant to section 305, 41304, 41308, or 41309 or \nchapter 421 or 441 of title 46; \n \n(4) all final orders of the Atomic Energy Com-\nmission made reviewable by section 2239 of title 42; \n \n(5) all rules, regulations, or final orders of the \nSurface Transportation Board made reviewable by \nsection 2321 of this title; \n \n(6) all final orders under section 812 of the Fair \nHousing Act; and \n \n(7) all final agency actions described in section \n20114(c) of title 49. \nJurisdiction is invoked by filing a petition as provided by \nsection 2344 of this title. \n \n \n \n\n4a \n \n4. \n28 U.S.C. 2344 provides:  \nReview of orders; time; notice; contents of petition; ser-\nvice \nOn the entry of a final order reviewable under this \nchapter, the agency shall promptly give notice thereof \nby service or publication in accordance with its rules. \nAny party aggrieved by the final order may, within 60 \ndays after its entry, file a petition to review the order in \nthe court of appeals wherein venue lies.  The action \nshall be against the United States.  The petition shall \ncontain a concise statement of\u2014 \n \n(1) the nature of the proceedings as to which re-\nview is sought; \n \n(2) the facts on which venue is based; \n \n(3) the grounds on which relief is sought; and \n \n(4) the relief prayed. \nThe petitioner shall attach to the petition, as exhibits, \ncopies of the order, report, or decision of the agency.  \nThe clerk shall serve a true copy of the petition on the \nagency and on the Attorney General by registered mail, \nwith request for a return receipt. \n \n5. \n28 U.S.C. 2348 provides: \nRepresentation in proceeding; intervention \nThe Attorney General is responsible for and has con-\ntrol of the interests of the Government in all court pro-\nceedings under this chapter.  The agency, and any \nparty in interest in the proceeding before the agency \nwhose interests will be affected if an order of the agency \n\n5a \n \nis or is not enjoined, set aside, or suspended, may appear \nas parties thereto of their own motion and as of right, \nand be represented by counsel in any proceeding to re-\nview the order.  Communities, associations, corpora-\ntions, firms, and individuals, whose interests are af-\nfected by the order of the agency, may intervene in any \nproceeding to review the order.  The Attorney General \nmay not dispose of or discontinue the proceeding to re-\nview over the objection of any party or intervenor, but \nany intervenor may prosecute, defend, or continue the \nproceeding unaffected by the action or inaction of the \nAttorney General. \n \n6. \n28 U.S.C. 2349(a) provides: \nJurisdiction of the proceeding \n(a) The court of appeals has jurisdiction of the pro-\nceeding on the filing and service of a petition to review.  \nThe court of appeals in which the record on review is \nfiled, on the filing, has jurisdiction to vacate stay orders \nor interlocutory injunctions previously granted by any \ncourt, and has exclusive jurisdiction to make and enter, \non the petition, evidence, and proceedings set forth in \nthe record on review, a judgment determining the valid-\nity of, and enjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in \nwhole or in part, the order of the agency. \n \n \n \n\n6a \n \n7. \n47 U.S.C. 155 provides in pertinent part: \nCommission \n*  *  *  *  * \n(c) \nDelegation of functions; exceptions to initial orders; \nforce, effect and enforcement of orders; administra-\ntive and judicial review; qualifications and compen-\nsation of delegates; assignment of cases; separation \nof review and investigative or prosecuting functions; \nsecretary; seal \n(1) When necessary to the proper functioning of the \nCommission and the prompt and orderly conduct of its \nbusiness, the Commission may, by published rule or by \norder, delegate any of its functions (except functions \ngranted to the Commission by this paragraph and by \nparagraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection and except \nany action referred to in sections 204(a)(2), 208(b), and \n405(b) of this title) to a panel of commissioners, an indi-\nvidual commissioner, an employee board, or an individ-\nual employee, including functions with respect to hear-\ning, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, or oth-\nerwise acting as to any work, business, or matter; except \nthat in delegating review functions to employees in \ncases of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5), \nthe delegation in any such case may be made only to an \nemployee board consisting of two or more employees re-\nferred to in paragraph (8) of this subsection.  Any such \nrule or order may be adopted, amended, or rescinded \nonly by a vote of a majority of the members of the Com-\nmission then holding office.  Except for cases involving \nthe authorization of service in the instructional televi-\nsion fixed service, or as otherwise provided in this chap-\nter, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Com-\n\n7a \n \nmission to provide for the conduct, by any person or per-\nsons other than persons referred to in paragraph (2) or \n(3) of section 556(b) of title 5, of any hearing to which \nsuch section applies. \n*  *  *  *  * \n(3) Any order, decision, report, or action made or \ntaken pursuant to any such delegation, unless reviewed \nas provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, shall \nhave the same force and effect, and shall be made, evi-\ndenced, and enforced in the same manner, as orders, de-\ncisions, reports, or other actions of the Commission. \n(4) Any person aggrieved by any such order, deci-\nsion, report or action may file an application for review \nby the Commission within such time and in such manner \nas the Commission shall prescribe, and every such ap-\nplication shall be passed upon by the Commission.  The \nCommission, on its own initiative, may review in whole \nor in part, at such time and in such manner as it shall \ndetermine, any order, decision, report, or action made \nor taken pursuant to any delegation under paragraph (1) \nof this subsection. \n(5) In passing upon applications for review, the \nCommission may grant, in whole or in part, or deny such \napplications without specifying any reasons therefor.  \nNo such application for review shall rely on questions of \nfact or law upon which the panel of commissioners, indi-\nvidual commissioner, employee board, or individual em-\nployee has been afforded no opportunity to pass. \n(6) If the Commission grants the application for re-\nview, it may affirm, modify, or set aside the order, deci-\nsion, report, or action, or it may order a rehearing upon \n\n8a \n \nsuch order, decision, report, or action in accordance with \nsection 405 of this title. \n(7) The filing of an application for review under this \nsubsection shall be a condition precedent to judicial re-\nview of any order, decision, report, or action made or \ntaken pursuant to a delegation under paragraph (1) of \nthis subsection.  The time within which a petition for \nreview must be filed in a proceeding to which section \n402(a) of this title applies, or within which an appeal \nmust be taken under section 402(b) of this title, shall be \ncomputed from the date upon which public notice is \ngiven of orders disposing of all applications for review \nfiled in any case. \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n8. \n47 U.S.C. 227 provides in pertinent part: \nRestrictions on use of telephone equipment \n(a) \nDefinitions \nAs used in this section\u2014 \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n(3) The term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \nmeans equipment which has the capacity (A) to tran-\nscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or im-\nages (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper. \n*  *  *  *  * \n\n9a \n \n(b) \nRestrictions on use of automated telephone equip-\nment \n(1) Prohibitions \n \nIt shall be unlawful for any person within the \nUnited States, or any person outside the United \nStates if the recipient is within the United States\u2014 \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n(C) \nto use any telephone facsimile machine, \ncomputer, or other device to send, to a telephone \nfacsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement, \nunless\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthe unsolicited advertisement is from a \nsender with an established business relation-\nship with the recipient; \n \n(ii) the sender obtained the number of the \ntelephone facsimile machine through\u2014 \n \n(I) \nthe voluntary communication of such \nnumber, within the context of such estab-\nlished business relationship, from the recip-\nient of the unsolicited advertisement, or \n \n(II) a directory, advertisement, or site on \nthe Internet to which the recipient voluntar-\nily agreed to make available its facsimile \nnumber for public distribution, \nexcept that this clause shall not apply in the \ncase of an unsolicited advertisement that is \nsent based on an established business relation-\nship with the recipient that was in existence be-\nfore July 9, 2005, if the sender possessed the \n\n10a \n \nfacsimile machine number of the recipient be-\nfore July 9, 2005; and \n \n(iii) the unsolicited advertisement contains \na notice meeting the requirements under para-\ngraph (2)(D), \nexcept that the exception under clauses (i) and (ii) \nshall not apply with respect to an unsolicited ad-\nvertisement sent to a telephone facsimile machine \nby a sender to whom a request has been made not \nto send future unsolicited advertisements to such \ntelephone facsimile machine that complies with \nthe requirements under paragraph (2)(E); or \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n9. \n47 U.S.C. 402(a) provides: \nJudicial review of Commission\u2019s orders and decisions \n(a) \nProcedure \nAny proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or sus-\npend any order of the Commission under this chapter \n(except those appealable under subsection (b) of this \nsection) shall be brought as provided by and in the man-\nner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28. \n \n \n \n\n11a \n \n10.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been significantly sharpened by the petitioner's reply brief, which directly and forcefully counters the \"poor vehicle\" narrative established by the respondent. While my prior beliefs correctly identified the respondent's key arguments as the primary obstacles to certiorari, the reply brief has substantially weakened their potency, increasing the likelihood of a grant.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow:** The case remains a direct confrontation over the question left unresolved in ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.***: Does the Hobbs Act compel a district court to defer to an FCC's legal interpretation of the TCPA? The petitioner's reply brief leans heavily into this, framing the case as the ideal successor to *PDR Network* and noting the respondent does not deny the importance of the question or the existence of a circuit split.\n\n*   **Systematic Rebuttal of Respondent's \"Off-Ramps\":** The petitioner's reply brief provides specific, targeted rebuttals to the key arguments I previously identified as hurdles for certiorari. My belief in the strength of these hurdles has been revised:\n    1.  **Pending FCC Review (Weakened Hurdle):** I previously saw the pending FCC review of the *Amerifactors* order as a major ripeness problem. The petitioner counters this by framing it as a \"theoretical possibility\" and \"speculation\" that should not prevent the Court from resolving a live, harmful split. They argue the issue was ripe for review in *PDR Network* in 2018 and has only become more urgent. They cleverly turn the respondent's argument on its head, stating that if the respondent is so confident the FCC's interpretation is correct, they should welcome a judicial decision on the merits on remand. This reframes the issue from a procedural bar to a mere speculative delay.\n    2.  **Due Process/Party Posture (Weakened Hurdle):** I had noted the respondent's argument that this case was less compelling because a plaintiff, not a defendant, was challenging the FCC order. The petitioner dismisses this as irrelevant to the core legal question. They argue forcefully that the Hobbs Act's meaning does not change depending on which party invokes it. Critically, they cite Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network* to show his textual analysis applies to all parties, and Judge Pryor's concurrence in ***Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Systems, LP*** to illustrate the harm to plaintiffs when they cannot pursue a viable claim due to an agency's misinterpretation. This grounds their position in the very judicial reasoning that favors granting cert.\n    3.  **Alternative Statutory Grounds (Reframed Issue):** The respondent had suggested the Court could avoid the Hobbs Act question by affirming on the plain text of the TCPA. The petitioner effectively sidesteps this by clarifying the question presented is not *who* is right on the TCPA's meaning, but *whether a district court is barred from conducting the analysis at all*. This reframes the alternative grounds not as an \"off-ramp\" for the Supreme Court, but as the very issue to be decided on remand once the procedural question is settled.\n    4.  **Nature of the Circuit Split (Reaffirmed):** The petitioner counters the respondent's attempt to dissolve the split by distinguishing between \"interpretive rules\" and \"adjudications.\" They argue this distinction is immaterial because Ninth Circuit precedent treats the FCC order as binding *regardless of its characterization*. This brings the focus back to the practical outcome: in the Ninth Circuit, courts are bound, while in others they are not, meaning the split is real and active.\n\n*   **This Case as a \"Better Vehicle\":** A new and significant belief is that the petitioner has successfully argued this case is not just a suitable vehicle, but a *better* one than *PDR Network*. They point out that the second preliminary issue in *PDR Network*\u2014whether the party had a prior and adequate opportunity for review\u2014is not present here, as the petitioner concedes that point. This removes a procedural complication that previously frustrated the Court.\n\n*   **Anticipated Next Steps & Prediction Confidence:** The reply brief was the critical piece of evidence I was waiting for. It has substantially increased my confidence that the justices interested in this issue from *PDR Network* (at least four of them) will find this case to be a clean, compelling vehicle to finally resolve the question. The petitioner has provided a clear roadmap for the Court to grant certiorari, look past the respondent's procedural objections, and address the substantive statutory question. My prediction now leans more strongly toward a grant of certiorari. The next observation of interest will be the Court's order on the petition.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been fundamentally altered. The observation that the Solicitor General (SG) has filed a brief \"ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\" confirms that the Supreme Court has granted the petition, moving the case from the cert-worthiness stage to the merits. This is a monumental development. The SG's brief, filed in support of the respondent, is now the single most important piece of evidence for predicting the final outcome, and it points heavily against the petitioner.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow:** The case remains centered on the question left open in ***PDR Network***: Does the Hobbs Act compel district courts to treat FCC legal interpretations of the TCPA as binding? The granting of certiorari confirms that at least four justices believe this question warrants a definitive answer.\n\n*   **New Dominant Factor: The Solicitor General's Intervention:** The entry of the United States, via the Solicitor General's amicus brief, is a game-changer. The SG's support for the respondent (McKesson) significantly decreases the petitioner's probability of success. The SG's arguments provide the Court with two distinct, powerful paths to rule against the petitioner.\n\n*   **Path 1: The Procedural \"Off-Ramp\" (Vacate & Remand):** My prior belief that the petitioner had successfully neutralized procedural hurdles has been completely reversed by the SG's primary argument.\n    *   **The SG's \"Incorrect Premise\" Argument:** The SG forcefully argues that the entire case rests on a faulty premise. The *Amerifactors* order, issued by an FCC Bureau, is currently under review by the full Commission. The SG contends that because this internal agency review is a \"condition precedent to judicial review\" (citing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7)), the *Amerifactors* order was never a \"final order\" to which the Hobbs Act's exclusive review provision (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1)) could apply.\n    *   **Implication:** This argument gives the Court a clean, narrow, and technically sound basis to dispose of the case without reaching the thorny merits of the Hobbs Act question. The Court could vacate the Ninth Circuit's decision, holding that it erred by treating a non-final agency action as binding. This would be a procedural loss for the petitioner and would leave the central legal question unresolved for a future case. The attractiveness of this off-ramp, especially given the Court's prior fracture in *PDR Network*, cannot be overstated.\n\n*   **Path 2: The Merits \"Brick Wall\" (Affirm):** Should the Court choose to look past the finality issue and decide the main question, the SG has constructed a formidable defense of the respondent's position.\n    *   **The SG's Merits Argument:** The SG argues that the Hobbs Act's plain text\u2014vesting \"exclusive jurisdiction\" in the courts of appeals\u2014unambiguously bars collateral attacks on covered agency orders in district courts.\n    *   **Precedential Support:** The SG grounds this interpretation in key Supreme Court precedents like ***Yakus v. United States*** (upholding a similar scheme under the Emergency Price Control Act) and ***Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass'n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic***. This provides a strong, historically-grounded legal foundation for the Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit's ruling on the merits.\n    *   **Purpose and Structure:** The SG emphasizes that Congress's intent in passing the Hobbs Act was to create a uniform and efficient system for judicial review, and allowing collateral attacks in district courts would undermine that entire structure.\n\n*   **Revised Prediction & Confidence:** My prior optimism for the petitioner at the cert stage has evaporated. The SG's brief has dramatically lowered the petitioner's chances of prevailing. I now believe the most likely outcome is a loss for the petitioner, with the primary uncertainty being the *form* of that loss.\n    1.  **High Probability Outcome:** A vacatur and remand based on the SG's procedural argument that the *Amerifactors* order was not final. This allows the Court to correct the lower court's error without deciding the difficult question that split them in *PDR Network*.\n    2.  **Secondary High Probability Outcome:** An affirmance on the merits, where the Court adopts the SG's reasoning that the Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks. This would resolve the circuit split in the respondent's favor.\n\nThe petitioner, who successfully argued this was the \"perfect vehicle\" to resolve the *PDR Network* question, now faces the government arguing that this vehicle is procedurally defective, and even if it weren't, it should lose on the merits anyway. The path to victory for the petitioner has become exceedingly narrow.",

It could either (a) reveal a significant weakness in the SG's procedural or substantive arguments, forcing a major update to my belief that the petitioner will lose, or (b) fail to effectively counter the SG, thus strongly confirming my current prediction and increasing my confidence. In either scenario, the reduction in uncertainty is substantial. This is the most critical piece of missing evidence for this specific case.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action tests and refines a core principle of legal prediction: the relative weight of a petitioner's merits brief versus a powerful, contrary amicus brief from the Solicitor General. The outcome will help calibrate my general model on whether an SG brief offering both a procedural 'off-ramp' and a merits 'brick wall' is nearly dispositive, or if a well-argued petitioner's brief can realistically overcome such a barrier.

But the court \ndidn\u2019t reach that conclusion based on anything in the text \nof the TCPA, which it never considered. Instead, the court \nconcluded that it was \u201cbound by\u201d an order from the \nFederal Communications Commission\u2014issued six years \ninto the litigation and after a class had been certified\u2014\nthat reversed the agency\u2019s longstanding contrary view of \nthe statute. The court applied circuit precedent construing \nthe Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, to require federal courts \nto enforce the FCC\u2019s reading of a federal statute without \nconsidering whether that interpretation is, in fact, correct. \nThe Ninth Circuit then adhered to that rule and affirmed \nwithout even citing the key statutory provision. \nThis Court confronted a similar scenario in PDR \nNetwork, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, 588 U.S. \n1 (2019). There, the Fourth Circuit held that it was bound \nby the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA, just like the \nNinth Circuit did below. Although a majority of this Court \ndidn\u2019t reach the question, four Justices concluded that the \nHobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party \u201cfrom arguing that the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. at 12 \n(Kavanaugh, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nJustice \nKavanaugh \nexplained \nthat, \nunder \n\u201celementary \nprinciples \nof \nadministrative law,\u201d the \u201cdefault rule is to allow review by \nthe district court of whether the agency interpretation is \ncorrect.\u201d Id. at 15. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean Water \nAct and Clean Air Act\u2014override that strong presumption \nby \u201cexpressly preclud[ing] judicial review in subsequent \nenforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 14. But the Hobbs Act is \n\n \n-2- \n\u201csilent\u201d on the subject, so the default rule controls. See id. \nat 15. \n Like PDR Network, this case involves private TCPA \nclaims for money damages and the appeal turns on \nwhether an FCC order bound the court. Yet the Ninth \nCircuit rejected the concurring Justices\u2019 reading of the \nHobbs Act without so much as citing PDR Network or \nengaging with their analysis. The court instead followed \ncircuit precedent holding that district courts\u2014even if they \n\u201cdoubt \u2026 the FCC\u2019s interpretation\u201d\u2014\u201care required by \nthe Hobbs Act to apply\u201d it. U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. \nHamilton, 224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000). \nNothing in the Hobbs Act\u2019s text supports the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s reading. The court relied on the provision of the \nAct that grants courts of appeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to \n\u2026 determine the validity\u201d of certain FCC orders. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2342. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cvalid\u201d \nincludes \u201chaving legal strength or force\u201d (as in the phrase \n\u201cvalid title\u201d or \u201cvalid regulation\u201d). To determine an order\u2019s \nvalidity, then, means to determine whether the order has \nlegal force. As Justice Kavanaugh wrote in PDR Network, \na court makes that determination \u201conly by entering a \ndeclaratory judgment that the order is valid or invalid\u201d\u2014\nnot by determining a defendant\u2019s liability in a civil action. \n588 U.S. at 21 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  \nAdditional textual evidence throughout the Hobbs Act \nbacks this up. Most tellingly, the phrase \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d is preceded by the terms \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d \nand \u201csuspend,\u201d each of which describes a specific form of \nequitable relief. Based on both common sense and the \nnoscitur a sociis canon, the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d should thus also be read to denote equitable relief: in \nthis case, a declaratory judgment.   \n\n \n-3- \n \nNor is there any other basis to conclude that Congress \ndesigned the Hobbs Act to strip district courts of their \nauthority to interpret a federal statute. The Act is \nunremarkable: one of many agency-review statutes that \nroutes cases seeking equitable relief against agencies to \nthe courts of appeals. To that end, it grants those courts \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity\u201d of covered orders by the FCC and other \nagencies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. No one doubts that district \ncourts may not hear pre-enforcement petitions seeking \nthose specific forms of relief. But the Act says nothing \nabout other kinds of actions, like a private action for \nmoney damages, that are properly filed in federal district \ncourt under ordinary federal-question jurisdiction. \nFinally, even if the Hobbs Act foreclosed review of the \nFCC\u2019s legislative rules (which at least have the force of \nlaw), the Ninth Circuit would still be wrong to apply that \nreading to the FCC\u2019s non-binding interpretive guidance. \nBoth parties agreed below that the order at issue here is \ninterpretive because, rather than creating new rules or \nstandards of conduct, it serves primarily to advise the \npublic about the agency\u2019s construction of the TCPA. And \nbecause interpretive rules lack the force of law, they can \nnever bind parties and courts\u2014whether valid or not. \nIf adopted by this Court, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach \nwould turn the FCC\u2019s legal opinion \u201cinto the equivalent of \na statute,\u201d elevating the agency\u2019s view of the law over the \nview of Article III judges and the text of the statute itself. \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nBecause the Hobbs Act does not require district courts to \ngive the FCC such \u201cabsolute deference\u201d in garden-variety \ncivil cases like this one, this Court should reverse.

L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, as amended \nby the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n\n \n-5- \n21, 119 Stat. 359, is codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3) and \nprovides in relevant part: \nThe term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d means \nequipment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe \ntext or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or \nimages (or both) from an electronic signal received \nover a regular telephone line onto paper. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. The Hobbs Act \n1. The Hobbs Act establishes what the Administrative \nProcedure Act calls a \u201cspecial statutory review \nproceeding\u201d for direct judicial review of certain orders of \nthe FCC and about half a dozen other agencies. 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 703. There\u2019s \u201cnothing unique\u201d about a \u201cjurisdiction-\nchanneling\u201d provision of this sort. Blitz v. Napolitano, 700 \nF.3d 733, 742 (4th Cir. 2012). The Hobbs Act is one among \n\u201ca startling array of specific statutory provisions\u201d that \n\u201cestablish court of appeals jurisdiction to review actions of \nagencies.\u201d 16 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3941 (3d ed. 2024).1 \nSection 2342 of the Hobbs Act specifies the agency \nactions that are subject to direct review and the relief that \n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all internal quotation marks, \nemphases, alterations, and citations are omitted from quotations \nthroughout. Citations to \u201cPet. App.\u201d are to the appendix submitted \nwith the petition for certiorari, citations to \u201cER\u201d are to the excerpts \nof record filed in the Ninth Circuit, and citations to \u201cSER\u201d are to the \nsupplemental excerpts of record filed in the Ninth Circuit. \n\n \n-6- \nmay be granted to a prevailing party. It covers a range of \nactions by the covered agencies\u2014which include not only \nthe FCC, but also the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of Transportation, and the Atomic Energy \nCommission, among others. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1)\u2013(7). \nBut the Act does not cover every action taken by the \nagencies in its purview. For instance, it provides that the \ncourt of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to directly \nreview only those \u201crules, regulations, or final orders\u201d of \nthe Secretary of Transportation that are issued pursuant \nto \ncertain \nspecific \nstatutory \nprovisions. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 2342(3)(A); see also id. \u00a7 2342(6) (applying to \u201call final \norders under section 812 of the Fair Housing Act\u201d).  \nAs to the FCC, section 2342 provides that \u201c[t]he court \nof appeals \u2026 has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, \nsuspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof \u2026 all final orders of the [FCC] made reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2342, 2342(1). Consistent \nwith the approach taken for several other agencies, see, \ne.g. id. \u00a7 2342(4)\u2013(5), this provision thus does not subject \nevery FCC order to the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusive-review \nprocedures. Instead, it applies only to those FCC orders \nthat are \u201cmade reviewable\u201d by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a). And \nsection 402(a), in turn, covers (with some exceptions not \nrelevant here) only those orders that may be made the \nsubject of a \u201cproceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or \nsuspend any order of the Commission.\u201d Id. \nA separate section of the Hobbs Act authorizes the \ncourt of appeals in such a proceeding to enter \u201ca judgment \ndetermining the validity of, and enjoining, setting aside, \nor suspending, in whole or in part, the order of the \nagency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2349(a). The Act sets out procedures \nfor filing a \u201cpetition to review\u201d to obtain these judgments, \n\n \n-7- \nproviding that such actions \u201cshall be against the United \nStates,\u201d id. \u00a7 2344, \u201cwithin 60 days\u201d of entry of the final \norder, id., \u201cin the judicial circuit in which the petitioner \nresides or has its principal office, or in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 2343. Multiple petitions challenging the same law are \nconsolidated in a single court of appeals. Id. \u00a7 2112(a)(3).  \nAs commentators have observed, the legislative \nhistory at the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act \n\u201csuggests that the Act\u2019s drafters did not intend the \njurisdictional reforms to apply to private enforcement \nactions because such proceedings lacked a record made by \nthe agency.\u201d Jason N. Sigalos, The Other Hobbs Act: An \nOld Leviathan in the Modern Administrative State, 54 \nGa. L. Rev. 1095, 1122 (2020). For instance, a \u201cdetailed and \nspecific memorandum of coverage\u201d contained in the \nHouse Report recognized that the Hobbs Act would not \n\u201crelate to actions between private parties to enforce \nvarious liabilities created by the Interstate Commerce \nAct.\u201d Id. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 80-1619, at 4 (1948)); see \nalso id. at 1122 n.179 (noting that \u201cthe logic behind H.R. \n1468\u2019s limited coverage equally applies to private rights of \nactions created by law such as the TCPA\u201d).  \n2. Six years ago, in PDR Network, this Court granted \ncertiorari to decide the same question presented here: \nwhether the Hobbs Act requires a district court in a \nprivate lawsuit \u201cto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation \nof the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\u201d 588 U.S. at 6. \nA majority of the Court, however, \u201cfound it difficult to \nanswer this question\u201d because of \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d \nthat had been raised by the petitioner but not addressed \nby the court of appeals: (1) whether the FCC order at \nissue was an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d such that it might not be \n\n \n-8- \nsubject to the Hobbs Act, and (2) whether the Act failed to \nafford the petitioner a \u201cprior\u201d and \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity \nfor judicial review of the order\u2014which would make the \norder subject to judicial review \u201cin civil \u2026 proceedings for \njudicial enforcement\u201d under section 703 of the APA. Id. at \n4, 7\u20138; see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. Without deciding the question \npresented, the Court remanded for the lower court to \naddress these issues.  \nFour members of the Court, in a concurrence \nauthored by Justice Kavanaugh, would have reached \u201cthe \nquestion that we granted certiorari to decide.\u201d Id. at 12 \n(Kavanaugh, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nJustice \nKavanaugh \nexplained that the Hobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party in a \nprivate enforcement action \u201cfrom arguing that the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. That \nconclusion flows from a \u201cstraightforward\u201d analysis of the \nstatute\u2019s plain text. Id. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean \nWater Act and Clean Air Act\u2014\u201cexpressly preclude \njudicial review in subsequent enforcement actions\u201d and \ntherefore bar parties in those actions from arguing that \nthe agency misinterpreted the statute. Id. at 14. \nBut unlike those statutes, the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent \nabout review in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at \n15. So the \u201cgeneral rule of administrative law\u201d kicks in and \nallows a party to argue, and a district court to consider, \nthat the FCC\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong. Id. at \n12. In other words, the court is \u201cnot bound by the agency\u2019s \nin\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

But the court \ndidn\u2019t reach that conclusion based on anything in the text \nof the TCPA, which it never considered. Instead, the court \nconcluded that it was \u201cbound by\u201d an order from the \nFederal Communications Commission\u2014issued six years \ninto the litigation and after a class had been certified\u2014\nthat reversed the agency\u2019s longstanding contrary view of \nthe statute. The court applied circuit precedent construing \nthe Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, to require federal courts \nto enforce the FCC\u2019s reading of a federal statute without \nconsidering whether that interpretation is, in fact, correct. \nThe Ninth Circuit then adhered to that rule and affirmed \nwithout even citing the key statutory provision. \nThis Court confronted a similar scenario in PDR \nNetwork, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, 588 U.S. \n1 (2019). There, the Fourth Circuit held that it was bound \nby the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA, just like the \nNinth Circuit did below. Although a majority of this Court \ndidn\u2019t reach the question, four Justices concluded that the \nHobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party \u201cfrom arguing that the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. at 12 \n(Kavanaugh, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nJustice \nKavanaugh \nexplained \nthat, \nunder \n\u201celementary \nprinciples \nof \nadministrative law,\u201d the \u201cdefault rule is to allow review by \nthe district court of whether the agency interpretation is \ncorrect.\u201d Id. at 15. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean Water \nAct and Clean Air Act\u2014override that strong presumption \nby \u201cexpressly preclud[ing] judicial review in subsequent \nenforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 14. But the Hobbs Act is \n\n \n-2- \n\u201csilent\u201d on the subject, so the default rule controls. See id. \nat 15. \n Like PDR Network, this case involves private TCPA \nclaims for money damages and the appeal turns on \nwhether an FCC order bound the court. Yet the Ninth \nCircuit rejected the concurring Justices\u2019 reading of the \nHobbs Act without so much as citing PDR Network or \nengaging with their analysis. The court instead followed \ncircuit precedent holding that district courts\u2014even if they \n\u201cdoubt \u2026 the FCC\u2019s interpretation\u201d\u2014\u201care required by \nthe Hobbs Act to apply\u201d it. U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. \nHamilton, 224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000). \nNothing in the Hobbs Act\u2019s text supports the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s reading. The court relied on the provision of the \nAct that grants courts of appeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to \n\u2026 determine the validity\u201d of certain FCC orders. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2342. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cvalid\u201d \nincludes \u201chaving legal strength or force\u201d (as in the phrase \n\u201cvalid title\u201d or \u201cvalid regulation\u201d). To determine an order\u2019s \nvalidity, then, means to determine whether the order has \nlegal force. As Justice Kavanaugh wrote in PDR Network, \na court makes that determination \u201conly by entering a \ndeclaratory judgment that the order is valid or invalid\u201d\u2014\nnot by determining a defendant\u2019s liability in a civil action. \n588 U.S. at 21 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  \nAdditional textual evidence throughout the Hobbs Act \nbacks this up. Most tellingly, the phrase \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d is preceded by the terms \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d \nand \u201csuspend,\u201d each of which describes a specific form of \nequitable relief. Based on both common sense and the \nnoscitur a sociis canon, the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d should thus also be read to denote equitable relief: in \nthis case, a declaratory judgment.   \n\n \n-3- \n \nNor is there any other basis to conclude that Congress \ndesigned the Hobbs Act to strip district courts of their \nauthority to interpret a federal statute. The Act is \nunremarkable: one of many agency-review statutes that \nroutes cases seeking equitable relief against agencies to \nthe courts of appeals. To that end, it grants those courts \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cenjoin\u201d and \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity\u201d of covered orders by the FCC and other \nagencies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. No one doubts that district \ncourts may not hear pre-enforcement petitions seeking \nthose specific forms of relief. But the Act says nothing \nabout other kinds of actions, like a private action for \nmoney damages, that are properly filed in federal district \ncourt under ordinary federal-question jurisdiction. \nFinally, even if the Hobbs Act foreclosed review of the \nFCC\u2019s legislative rules (which at least have the force of \nlaw), the Ninth Circuit would still be wrong to apply that \nreading to the FCC\u2019s non-binding interpretive guidance. \nBoth parties agreed below that the order at issue here is \ninterpretive because, rather than creating new rules or \nstandards of conduct, it serves primarily to advise the \npublic about the agency\u2019s construction of the TCPA. And \nbecause interpretive rules lack the force of law, they can \nnever bind parties and courts\u2014whether valid or not. \nIf adopted by this Court, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach \nwould turn the FCC\u2019s legal opinion \u201cinto the equivalent of \na statute,\u201d elevating the agency\u2019s view of the law over the \nview of Article III judges and the text of the statute itself. \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nBecause the Hobbs Act does not require district courts to \ngive the FCC such \u201cabsolute deference\u201d in garden-variety \ncivil cases like this one, this Court should reverse.

L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, as amended \nby the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n\n \n-5- \n21, 119 Stat. 359, is codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3) and \nprovides in relevant part: \nThe term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d means \nequipment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe \ntext or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or \nimages (or both) from an electronic signal received \nover a regular telephone line onto paper. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. The Hobbs Act \n1. The Hobbs Act establishes what the Administrative \nProcedure Act calls a \u201cspecial statutory review \nproceeding\u201d for direct judicial review of certain orders of \nthe FCC and about half a dozen other agencies. 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 703. There\u2019s \u201cnothing unique\u201d about a \u201cjurisdiction-\nchanneling\u201d provision of this sort. Blitz v. Napolitano, 700 \nF.3d 733, 742 (4th Cir. 2012). The Hobbs Act is one among \n\u201ca startling array of specific statutory provisions\u201d that \n\u201cestablish court of appeals jurisdiction to review actions of \nagencies.\u201d 16 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3941 (3d ed. 2024).1 \nSection 2342 of the Hobbs Act specifies the agency \nactions that are subject to direct review and the relief that \n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all internal quotation marks, \nemphases, alterations, and citations are omitted from quotations \nthroughout. Citations to \u201cPet. App.\u201d are to the appendix submitted \nwith the petition for certiorari, citations to \u201cER\u201d are to the excerpts \nof record filed in the Ninth Circuit, and citations to \u201cSER\u201d are to the \nsupplemental excerpts of record filed in the Ninth Circuit. \n\n \n-6- \nmay be granted to a prevailing party. It covers a range of \nactions by the covered agencies\u2014which include not only \nthe FCC, but also the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of Transportation, and the Atomic Energy \nCommission, among others. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1)\u2013(7). \nBut the Act does not cover every action taken by the \nagencies in its purview. For instance, it provides that the \ncourt of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to directly \nreview only those \u201crules, regulations, or final orders\u201d of \nthe Secretary of Transportation that are issued pursuant \nto \ncertain \nspecific \nstatutory \nprovisions. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 2342(3)(A); see also id. \u00a7 2342(6) (applying to \u201call final \norders under section 812 of the Fair Housing Act\u201d).  \nAs to the FCC, section 2342 provides that \u201c[t]he court \nof appeals \u2026 has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, \nsuspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof \u2026 all final orders of the [FCC] made reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2342, 2342(1). Consistent \nwith the approach taken for several other agencies, see, \ne.g. id. \u00a7 2342(4)\u2013(5), this provision thus does not subject \nevery FCC order to the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusive-review \nprocedures. Instead, it applies only to those FCC orders \nthat are \u201cmade reviewable\u201d by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a). And \nsection 402(a), in turn, covers (with some exceptions not \nrelevant here) only those orders that may be made the \nsubject of a \u201cproceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or \nsuspend any order of the Commission.\u201d Id. \nA separate section of the Hobbs Act authorizes the \ncourt of appeals in such a proceeding to enter \u201ca judgment \ndetermining the validity of, and enjoining, setting aside, \nor suspending, in whole or in part, the order of the \nagency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2349(a). The Act sets out procedures \nfor filing a \u201cpetition to review\u201d to obtain these judgments, \n\n \n-7- \nproviding that such actions \u201cshall be against the United \nStates,\u201d id. \u00a7 2344, \u201cwithin 60 days\u201d of entry of the final \norder, id., \u201cin the judicial circuit in which the petitioner \nresides or has its principal office, or in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 2343. Multiple petitions challenging the same law are \nconsolidated in a single court of appeals. Id. \u00a7 2112(a)(3).  \nAs commentators have observed, the legislative \nhistory at the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act \n\u201csuggests that the Act\u2019s drafters did not intend the \njurisdictional reforms to apply to private enforcement \nactions because such proceedings lacked a record made by \nthe agency.\u201d Jason N. Sigalos, The Other Hobbs Act: An \nOld Leviathan in the Modern Administrative State, 54 \nGa. L. Rev. 1095, 1122 (2020). For instance, a \u201cdetailed and \nspecific memorandum of coverage\u201d contained in the \nHouse Report recognized that the Hobbs Act would not \n\u201crelate to actions between private parties to enforce \nvarious liabilities created by the Interstate Commerce \nAct.\u201d Id. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 80-1619, at 4 (1948)); see \nalso id. at 1122 n.179 (noting that \u201cthe logic behind H.R. \n1468\u2019s limited coverage equally applies to private rights of \nactions created by law such as the TCPA\u201d).  \n2. Six years ago, in PDR Network, this Court granted \ncertiorari to decide the same question presented here: \nwhether the Hobbs Act requires a district court in a \nprivate lawsuit \u201cto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation \nof the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\u201d 588 U.S. at 6. \nA majority of the Court, however, \u201cfound it difficult to \nanswer this question\u201d because of \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d \nthat had been raised by the petitioner but not addressed \nby the court of appeals: (1) whether the FCC order at \nissue was an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d such that it might not be \n\n \n-8- \nsubject to the Hobbs Act, and (2) whether the Act failed to \nafford the petitioner a \u201cprior\u201d and \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity \nfor judicial review of the order\u2014which would make the \norder subject to judicial review \u201cin civil \u2026 proceedings for \njudicial enforcement\u201d under section 703 of the APA. Id. at \n4, 7\u20138; see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. Without deciding the question \npresented, the Court remanded for the lower court to \naddress these issues.  \nFour members of the Court, in a concurrence \nauthored by Justice Kavanaugh, would have reached \u201cthe \nquestion that we granted certiorari to decide.\u201d Id. at 12 \n(Kavanaugh, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nJustice \nKavanaugh \nexplained that the Hobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party in a \nprivate enforcement action \u201cfrom arguing that the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. That \nconclusion flows from a \u201cstraightforward\u201d analysis of the \nstatute\u2019s plain text. Id. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean \nWater Act and Clean Air Act\u2014\u201cexpressly preclude \njudicial review in subsequent enforcement actions\u201d and \ntherefore bar parties in those actions from arguing that \nthe agency misinterpreted the statute. Id. at 14. \nBut unlike those statutes, the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent \nabout review in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at \n15. So the \u201cgeneral rule of administrative law\u201d kicks in and \nallows a party to argue, and a district court to consider, \nthat the FCC\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong. Id. at \n12. In other words, the court is \u201cnot bound by the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation\u201d of the statute\u2014a reading of the Hobbs Act \nthat is reinforced by the basic \u201cunfairness\u201d and \u201cserious \nconstitutional issue[s]\u201d raised by a rule barring a party \nand a district court in an \u201cas-applied enforcement action\u201d \nfrom addressing \u201cthe reach and authority of agency \nrules.\u201d Id. at 15, 19. Justice Kavanaugh noted that this \n\n \n-9- \nanalysis of the Hobbs Act\u2019s proper meaning \u201cremains \navailable to other courts in the future.\u201d Id. at 13. \nJustice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, also \nconcurred separately to note not only that \u201c[i]nterpreting \na statute does not \u2018determine the validity\u2019 of an agency \norder interpreting or implementing a statute,\u201d but also \nthat a \u201ccontrary view would arguably render the Hobbs \nAct unconstitutional.\u201d Id. at 9 (Thomas, J., concurring). As \nJustice Thomas explained, to the extent the Hobbs Act \n\u201crequires courts to \u2018give the \u201cforce of law\u201d to agency \npronouncements on matters of private conduct\u2019 without \nregard to the text of the governing statute, the Act would \nbe unconstitutional\u201d because \u201cit would \u2018permit a body \nother than Congress\u2019 to exercise the legislative power, in \nviolation of Article I.\u201d Id. at 10. As a result, Justice \nThomas \nrecognized, \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cconstitutional-\navoidance\u201d doctrine \u201cwould militate against\u201d such an \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act. Id.  \nB. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act  \nCongress passed the TCPA in response to the public\u2019s \n\u201coutrage[] over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance \ncalls.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227 note. As amended by the Junk Fax \nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 109-21, 119 Stat. 359, the law \ntargets \u201ca number of problems associated with junk \nfaxes.\u201d Imhoff Inv., LLC v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F.3d 627, \n633 (6th Cir. 2015). Junk faxes often force the recipient, \nfrequently small businesses, to incur significant costs in \nthe form of \u201cpaper and ink\u201d and \u201ctied up\u201d fax lines, id., \nwhile also \u201cinterrupt[ing] the recipient\u2019s privacy\u201d and \nplacing unnecessary stress on the \u201crecipient\u2019s fax \nmachines.\u201d ER415. \nFor these reasons, Congress made it unlawful \u201cto use \nany telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other \n\n \n-10- \ndevice to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \nunsolicited advertisement.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). It \nbroadly defined the term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d to \ninclude any \u201cequipment which has the capacity (A) to \ntranscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a regular \ntelephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or images (or both) \nfrom an electronic signal received over a regular \ntelephone line onto paper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn the years since the TCPA was amended to prohibit \nusing fax machines to send unsolicited advertisements, \nmarketers have shifted much of their advertising online. \nBut as both the FCC and courts have long explained, the \nTCPA\u2019s bar on unsolicited faxes extends to faxes sent \nfrom and to \u201ccomputerized\u201d fax machines, which qualify \nas a \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d under the definition set \nforth in the statute. See In re Rules & Regs. \nImplementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 68 FR \n44144-01, \u00b6 143 (FCC July 25, 2003). \nThat is because the TCPA \u201cbroadly applies to any \nequipment that has the capacity to send or receive text or \nimages,\u201d which \u201censure[s] that the prohibition on \nunsolicited faxing\u201d cannot be easily circumvented as \ntechnology advances. Id. \u00b6 144 (emphasis added). \nUnsolicited faxes sent to a recipient\u2019s \u201cinbox,\u201d the FCC \nhas explained, still risk \u201cshift[ing] the advertising cost of \npaper and toner to the recipient\u201d and \u201cmay also tie up lines \nand printers so that the recipients\u2019 requested faxes are not \ntimely received.\u201d Id. \u00b6 145. \u201cCongress could not have \nintended to allow easy circumvention of its prohibition \nwhen faxes are \u2026 transmitted to personal computers and \nfax servers, rather than traditional stand-alone facsimile \nmachines.\u201d Id. \u00b6 144. \n\n \n-11- \nCourts have thus been \u201cunpersuaded\u201d by attempts to \n\u201climit a \u2018telephone facsimile machine\u2019 only to traditional \nfax machines.\u201d Lyngaas v. Curaden AG, 992 F.3d 412, 425 \n(6th Cir. 2021). As the Sixth Circuit explained, \u201csuch a \nnarrow definition does not comport with the plain \nlanguage of the TCPA.\u201d Id. at 425\u201326. The statute\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine,\u201d the court held, \n\u201cmakes clear\u201d that it \u201cencompasses more than traditional \nfax machines that automatically print a fax received over \na telephone line.\u201d Id. at 426. Rather, it includes any \n\u201cequipment that has the capacity to transcribe text or \nimages from or onto paper\u2014as long as the electronic \nsignal is transmitted or received over a telephone line.\u201d Id. \nGiven \u201cthe high probability that \u2026 a computer is \nconnected to a printer and to a modem capable of receiving \nfaxes,\u201d it \u201cis fully capable of receiving electronic signals \nover a telephone line and printing out a fax.\u201d Id. at 426\u201327. \n\u201cThe statutory text alone, therefore, rebuts the [] \nargument.\u201d Id. at 426; see also Meyer v. Portfolio \nRecovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2012) \n(similar for \u201cautomatic telephone dialing system\u201d). \nII. Factual and procedural background \nA. McKesson Corporation is a publicly traded \ncompany with hundreds of subsidiaries and affiliated \ncompanies and businesses that range from the sale of \npharmaceuticals to behavioral coaching and information \ntechnology. ER4. One of its business units, Physician \nPractice Solutions, regularly engages in promotional fax \ncampaigns designed to \u201cmarket its products and services\u201d \nto physician practices throughout the country. ER8. To \ncarry out this marketing, McKesson \u201cemployed a fax \nbroadcasting company\u201d to transmit faxes. ER6. \n\n \n-12- \nMcLaughlin Chiropractic Associates is one of the \nphysician practices targeted by McKesson. ER4. In 2009 \nand 2010, it, along with many other small medical \npractices, received multiple unsolicited advertisements \nvia fax from McKesson. ER417. These advertisements\u2014\nsome of which were received on stand-alone fax machines \nand some of which were received through online fax \nservices\u2014marketed McKesson\u2019s software products. ER5. \nMcKesson was aware that engaging in this type of \nadvertising campaign risked violating the TCPA. A year \nearlier, in 2008, the FCC warned McKesson that it had \n\u201csent one or more unsolicited advertisements\u201d via fax \u201cin \nviolation of the TCPA.\u201d ER4\u20135. The FCC issued \nMcKesson a citation and notified the company that, in the \nevent of any future complaint, it would bear the burden of \nshowing that it complied with the TCPA. ER5. \nB. Having received the unlawful faxes, McLaughlin \nChiropractic \nand \nanother \npractice \n(True \nHealth \nChiropractic, Inc.) brought a putative class action against \nMcKesson for sending unsolicited fax advertisements in \nviolation of the TCPA, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). ER450. \nAfter several years of litigation and an appeal to the \nNinth Circuit from the denial of class certification, True \nHealth Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923 \n(9th Cir. 2018), the district court eventually certified a \nsingle class of all persons or entities whose fax numbers \nhad been previously identified and \u201cwho received faxes \nfrom McKesson\u201d during the class period without being \nnotified of their right to opt out of future faxes. ER71. It \nappointed \nMcLaughlin \nChiropractic\u2014the \npetitioner \nhere\u2014to represent the class. Id. \nC. Six years into litigation, however, the FCC abruptly \nchanged its position. Shortly after the class was certified, \n\n \n-13- \nthe FCC issued an order (known as the Amerifactors \norder) interpreting the text of the TCPA provision at issue \nhere. See Pet. App. 46a. In this order, the FCC construed \nthe TCPA to exclude an \u201conline fax service\u201d from the \ndefinition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine.\u201d Pet. App. 48a. \nIn the FCC\u2019s view, an \u201conline fax service that effectively \nreceives faxes sent as email over the Internet\u201d is \u201cnot \nitself equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper\u201d and so \u201cfalls outside \nthe scope of the statutory prohibition.\u201d Pet. App. 48a. The \nFCC further reasoned that, because an online fax service \n\u201ccannot itself print a fax,\u201d it did not implicate the specific \nharms Congress addressed in the TCPA, namely \n\u201cadvertiser cost-shifting.\u201d Pet. App. 52a\u201353a. \nThis order changed the trajectory of the case. \nAlthough the district court \u201cagree[d] with the reasoning \nof Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR,\u201d it concluded \nthat \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required it to \u201ctreat \nAmerifactors as authoritative.\u201d Pet. App. 36a. In reaching \nthat conclusion, the court held that it \u201cdoes not matter\u201d \nunder the Hobbs Act whether the Amerifactors order was \na non-binding \u201cinterpretive rule.\u201d Pet. App. 37a\u201338a. \nUnder controlling Ninth Circuit case law, so long as the \nrelevant FCC order is \u201cfinal,\u201d the Hobbs Act applies \nregardless of whether the order is characterized as \n\u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cinterpretive.\u201d Pet. App. 37a\u201338a; see \nHamilton, 224 F.3d at 1055 (holding that the Hobbs Act \n\u201ccontains no exception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case \nlaw does not create one\u201d). As a result, according to the \ndistrict court, the Amerifactors order was \u201ca final, binding \norder for purposes of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \n\n \n-14- \nThe district court also held that it did not matter that \nan application for review of the Amerifactors order was \npending before the FCC. According to both FCC \nregulations and case law, reconsideration petitions do \u201cnot \naffect the order\u2019s finality as it applies to [a defendant\u2019s] \npotential liability under the TCPA.\u201d Id. (citing 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7  1.102 (b)(1); Comm. To Save WEAM v. FCC, 808 \nF.2d 113, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  \nBecause the FCC\u2019s order was \u201cdeterminative of the \nviability of this case,\u201d the court held that it was required \nto decertify the class. Pet. App. 20a. It then sua sponte \nentered summary judgment for McKesson on the claims \ninvolving the receipt of faxes via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d \nER20\u201321. \nD. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Without citing or \ndiscussing either the majority\u2019s opinion or Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR Network, the court held \nthat the district court \u201ccorrectly found that that it was \nbound by the [FCC\u2019s] Amerifactors declaratory ruling, \nwhich determined that the TCPA does not apply to faxes \nreceived through an online fax service.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. That \nwas so, in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, because the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s exclusive-jurisdiction provision\u2014which \u201cencom-\npasses \u2018any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or \nsuspend any order\u2019\u201d of the FCC\u2014forecloses a district \ncourt in private litigation alleging a violation of the TCPA \nfrom \neven \nconsidering \nwhether \nthe \nagency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute is wrong. Pet. App. 7a. The \nNinth Circuit also confirmed that the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors \ndecision was both an \u201corder\u201d of the FCC and \u201cfinal.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a\u20139a. And although the FCC issued its \nAmerifactors order while this case was pending, the court \n\n \n-15- \nconcluded that it \u201capplies retroactively to the faxes at \nissue here.\u201d Pet. App. 9a. \nBecause the Amerifactors order itself \u201cmakes clear \nthat the TCPA does not apply to such faxes,\u201d the Ninth \nCircuit concluded, the \u201cdistrict court was bound\u201d to \ndecertify the class and \u201cgrant summary judgment to \nMcKesson on any class claims for faxes received through \nan online fax service.\u201d Id. The court then denied en banc \nreview without comment. Pet. App. 2a.2 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.A. The Hobbs Act grants the federal courts of \nappeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to \u2026 determine the validity \nof\u201d certain FCC orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. The Ninth \nCircuit has broadly construed the phrase \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d to bar district courts in private litigation from \neven considering an interpretation of the TCPA found in \nan FCC order, let alone disagreeing with it\u2014even if the \ncourt is convinced that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the \nstatute is wrong. But that expansive reading of the Hobbs \nAct is \u201cincorrect,\u201d as four Justices recognized in PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). A \ndistrict court\u2019s agreement or disagreement with an \nagency interpretation of a statute in a particular case \ndoesn\u2019t bear on the order\u2019s \u201cvalidity\u201d because it neither \ndeclares the order invalid nor enjoins its enforcement. \nThe term \u201cvalid,\u201d especially when used in a legal \ncontext, typically refers to something that is legally \n\u201ceffective\u201d or \u201cbinding,\u201d as in the common phrases \u201cvalid \n \n2 The Ninth Circuit also affirmed the district court\u2019s orders \ndenying treble damages on the plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims and \ngranting summary judgment to the plaintiffs on respondent\u2019s consent \ndefense. Those rulings are not at issue here. \n\n \n-16- \ntitle\u201d and \u201cvalid regulation.\u201d To \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d \nan order is thus to decide whether it is legally effective. As \nJustice Kavanaugh pointed out in PDR Network, a court \ncan make that assessment \u201conly by entering a declaratory \njudgment that the order is valid or invalid.\u201d Id. at 21. \nContext confirms this straightforward interpretation. \nThe phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d is preceded by the \nterms \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d and \u201csuspend,\u201d each of which \ndescribes a specific form of equitable relief. Based on both \ncommon sense and the noscitur a sociis canon, the phrase \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d should therefore also be read \nto denote a form equitable relief: a declaratory judgment. \nOtherwise, the three preceding terms would be rendered \nmeaningless. Additional textual clues throughout the \nHobbs Act further confirm that \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d refers only to an equitable remedy like a declaratory \njudgment. That reading is also the most consistent with \nstatute\u2019s purpose of consolidating facial, pre-enforcement \nchallenges to agency orders in the courts of appeals. \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading, by contrast, would force \ndistrict courts to grant what is tantamount to \u201cabsolute \ndeference\u201d to agency interpretations of a federal statute, \n\u201cno matter how wrong.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 26\u201327. \nThis would deny plaintiffs with valid claims of statutory \nviolations and defendants facing enforcement actions the \nability to argue against flawed agency decisions. It would \nalso bind future parties, including those unaware of the \nrule\u2019s existence and even people not yet born (or \ncorporations not yet formed) at the time of the agency \ndecision. Requiring all these potentially affected parties to \npreemptively file challenges within 60 days would be \nimpractical, inefficient, and contrary to Congress\u2019s intent. \n\n \n-17- \nI.B. Even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s expansive reading of \n\u201cdetermine the validity\u201d were a plausible one, the statute \nwould be at most ambiguous. But that is not enough to \ndeprive parties of judicial review in private litigation \nalleging violation of a statute. The APA codifies a strong \npresumption in favor of judicial review unless Congress \nexpressly states otherwise. When Congress intends to \npreclude judicial review, it thus includes language saying \nso clearly\u2014language that the Hobbs Act lacks. \nNobody disputes that the Hobbs Act\u2019s grant of \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d requires facial, pre-enforcement \nchallenges to be brought in the courts of appeals. But the \nAct says nothing about litigation between private parties \nalleging a statutory violation\u2014litigation that is not \nbrought against the United States and does not seek \ninjunctive or declaratory relief. That statutory silence \nleaves in place the default rule that district courts are free \nto interpret statutes in private disputes brought under \ntheir ordinary jurisdiction. And this result aligns with \nother regulatory contexts (such as cases involving the \nSEC or OSHA), where courts routinely review the \ncorrectness of agency interpretations of a statute.  \nCongress knows how to preclude judicial review when \nit wants to and has done so in statutes like the Clean Air \nAct, where regulated parties typically have the knowledge \nand resources to challenge agency action. But, unlike the \nHobbs Act, those statutes expressly preclude judicial \nreview in litigation between private litigants. For \nexample, the Emergency Price Control Act\u2014after \ngranting \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to the courts of appeals \nto consider wartime price regulations\u2014also included a \nsecond sentence that expressly deprived district courts of \njurisdiction to even \u201cconsider\u201d those regulations. \n\n \n-18- \nCongress\u2019s decision, just six years later, not to include \nsuch language in the Hobbs Act is strong evidence that it \nintended a different meaning.  \nThis conclusion is also required by constitutional-\navoidance principles. Barring parties from challenging \nagency interpretations in private litigation would raise \nserious due process and separation-of-powers concerns by \nundermining the duty and authority of Article III courts\u2019 \nduty to independently interpret and apply the law. \nBecause the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading would raise such \nsubstantial constitutional questions and is not compelled \nby the statutory text, that is reason enough to avoid it. \nII. The Hobbs Act also did not require the district \ncourt below to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the \nTCPA because the FCC\u2019s order in this case is interpretive \nguidance, not a legislative rule. Unlike legislative rules, \nwhich have the force of law and bind courts and private \nparties, interpretive rules merely clarify an agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of a statute and bind nobody. The Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s treatment of legislative and interpretive rules as \nequally binding under the Hobbs Act is inconsistent with \nbasic administrative-law principles and cannot be correct.  \nThe Amerifactors order is a prototypical interpretive \nrule: It clarifies the TCPA\u2019s definition of \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile service\u201d without imposing new obligations or \nrecognizing new rights. The district court was thus free to \nevaluate and reject it. Numerous courts have recognized \nthat interpretive rules like this one fall outside the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s scope, and that district courts retain their authority \nto interpret the statutes independently. To hold otherwise \nwould transform informal agency guidance into \u201cthe \nequivalent of a statute.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27. It \nwould be anomalous to hold that informal guidance, whose \n\n \n-19- \nonly authority is the \u201cpower to persuade,\u201d has the power \nto bind district courts. Nothing in the Hobbs Act suggests \nthat Congress could have intended that bizarre result. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Hobbs Act does not prohibit district courts \nfrom interpreting the TCPA in litigation between \nprivate parties. \nA. The Act\u2019s language, structure, and purpose \nrefute the Ninth Circuit\u2019s position.  \n1. The Hobbs Act grants the federal courts of appeals \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in \nwhole or in part), or to determine the validity of\u201d certain \nFCC \u201cfinal orders.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. This case turns on \nthe meaning of the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of.\u201d \nAlthough the Ninth Circuit has not precisely defined \nthis phrase, the court construes it broadly to bar district \ncourts in litigation between private parties from \n\u201cdisagree[ing]\u201d with (or even just \u201crais[ing] the same \nissues\u201d as) a covered FCC order. Wilson v. A.H. Belo \nCorp., 87 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (9th Cir. 1996). And that is \ntrue even if the court \u201cdoubt[s] the soundness of the \nFCC\u2019s [legal] interpretation.\u201d Hamilton, 224 F.3d at 1055. \nOn this reading, the courts of appeals\u2019 exclusive \njurisdiction \u201cto determine the validity of\u201d an agency order \n\u201cdivest[s] the district court of jurisdiction\u201d not only to \ncollaterally attack an FCC decision, but even to \u201cconsider \nthe issues\u201d that were the subject of that order. Wilson, 87 \nF.3d at 399\u2013400 (emphasis added). Indeed, even if the \ndistrict court \u201cagreed\u201d with the order, that would still \nconstitute \u201ca determination of the [order\u2019s] validity\u201d that, \nin the Ninth Circuit\u2019s eyes, \u201cwould violate \u00a7 2342.\u201d Id. at \n400 (emphasis added); see also Air Transp. Ass\u2019n v. Pub. \n\n \n-20- \nUtil. Comm\u2019n, 833 F.2d 200 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding that \nan FCC order rejecting a preemption argument deprived \nthe district court of jurisdiction to consider that \nargument).3 \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d attempts to \u201cpack a lot of congressional punch into a \nfew oblique words in the Hobbs Act.\u201d PDR Network, 588 \nU.S. at 26 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But, as Justice \nKavanaugh explained, that reading of the statute \u201cis \nincorrect.\u201d Id. at 20\u201321. A district court doesn\u2019t \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d an agency order just because \nit \u201cagrees or disagrees with the agency interpretation\u201d of \na statute. Id. at 21; see also id. at 9 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cInterpreting a statute does not \u2018determine \nthe validity\u2019 of an agency order \u2026 .\u201d). Such a decision, \nwhich merely applies the district court\u2019s interpretation of \nthe statute to the case before it, does not affect the \n\u201cvalidity\u201d of the order at all: It \u201cdoes not invalidate the \norder\u201d and does not prevent the agency from seeking to \n\u201cenforce the order against others.\u201d Id. at 21. That\u2019s \nbecause, even if the court \u201cdisagrees with the agency \ninterpretation,\u201d it \u201cdoes not issue a declaratory judgment \nor an injunction\u201d against the agency\u2019s order, but \u201csimply \ndetermines\u201d liability in a particular case \u201cunder the \ncorrect interpretation of the statute.\u201d Id.  \n \n3 Two other circuits have adopted similar rules. See, e.g., Carlton \n& Harris Chiropractic, Inc. v. PDR Network, LLC, 883 F.3d 459, 467 \n(4th Cir. 2018), vacated and remanded, 588 U.S. 1 (2019) (holding that \ncourts \u201cneed not \u2018harmonize\u2019 the FCC\u2019s rule with the underlying \nstatute\u201d); Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, 768 F.3d 1110, 1119\u2013\n20 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding that a district court \u201cexceed[s] its \njurisdiction\u201d if it decides that an FCC order is \u201cinconsistent with the \nTCPA\u201d even \u201cin a dispute between private parties\u201d). \n\n \n-21- \nBecause the order remains in effect, other courts may \nreach a different interpretation of the statute, but any \nresulting disagreements can be resolved by the courts of \nappeals and on certiorari in this Court. See id. at 26. \n2. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of the Hobbs Act fails \nto consider the plain meaning of \u201cdetermine the validity \nof.\u201d The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cvalid\u201d includes \n\u201c[h]aving legal strength or force.\u201d Webster\u2019s New \nCollegiate Dictionary (1949); see also American Heritage \nDictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2006) \n(\u201chaving legal force; effective or binding\u201d). In legal \nwriting, that\u2019s the primary definition of the word. See \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (\u201cvalid\u201d means \n\u201c[l]egally sufficient; binding\u201d); see also Vietnam Veterans \nof Am. v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 537 (D.C. Cir. \n1988) (explaining that, because \u201cvalid\u201d means \u201cbinding,\u201d it \nis a \u201cmere tautology\u201d to say that \u201conly [] \u2018valid\u2019 legislative \nrules bind the courts\u201d). For example, most people \nunderstand that the term \u201cvalid title\u201d refers to a title that \nis legally operative. See id. Likewise, courts commonly use \nphrases like \u201cvalid rule\u201d or \u201cvalid regulation\u201d to denote \nlegally operative agency actions. See, e.g., United States v. \nHaggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 391 (1999) (\u201cValid \nregulations establish legal norms\u201d and are \u201ccontrolling \nlaw.\u201d). The other key word in the phrase\u2014\u201cdetermine\u201d\u2014\nmeans \u201c[t]o come to a decision concerning.\u201d Webster\u2019s \nNew Collegiate Dictionary (1949); see American Heritage \nDictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2006) \n(\u201cdecide or settle \u2026 conclusively and authoritatively\u201d).  \nPutting this all together, to \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d \nan order means to \u201cdecide\u201d whether the order has \u201clegal \nforce\u201d or is \u201ceffective or binding.\u201d On that more restrained \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act, to \u201cdetermine the \n\n \n-22- \nvalidity\u201d of an agency order would ask whether the order \nis legally in effect. As Justice Kavanaugh explained in \nPDR Network, a court can make that determination \u201conly \nby entering a declaratory judgment that the order is valid \nor invalid.\u201d 588 U.S. at 21 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).4 \n3. This understanding of the phrase \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d is cinched by the surrounding statutory text. \nThe \u201ccanon of noscitur a sociis \u2026 counsels that a word is \ngiven more precise content by the neighboring words with \nwhich it is associated.\u201d Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., \n566 U.S. 624, 634\u201335 (2012). It \u201ctrack[s] the common sense \nintuition that Congress would not ordinarily introduce a \ngeneral term that renders meaningless the specific text \nthat accompanies it.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. \n480, 487 (2024). The canon thus \u201censures\u2014regardless of \nhow complicated a sentence might appear\u2014that none of \nits specific parts are made redundant by a clause literally \nbroad enough to include them.\u201d Id. at 488. \nThis principle applies with full force here. Each of the \nwords that precede the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d \nin section 2342\u2014\u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d\u2014\nrefers to specific kinds of equitable relief: \n\u2022 \u201cEnjoin\u201d means to \u201clegally prohibit or restrain by \ninjunction.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. \n \n4 It makes no difference that the party trying to challenge the \nFCC rule in PDR Network was a defendant, whereas here it\u2019s a \nplaintiff. See BIO at 18\u201320. The Hobbs Act does not distinguish \nbetween defendants and plaintiffs, and no circuit (including the Ninth \nCircuit) has drawn that distinction. Either the statute requires a \ndistrict court to adhere to the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in \nlitigation between private parties, or it does not. But the answer will \nnot be different depending on who happens to benefit from the FCC\u2019s \ninterpretation. \n\n \n-23- \n2024); see Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary \n(1949) (\u201cTo command; to admonish or direct with \nauthority. To forbid; prohibit.\u201d). \n\u2022 \u201cSet aside\u201d is a form of equitable relief meaning \u201cto \nannul or vacate\u201d an order. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary \n(12th ed. 2024); see also Webster\u2019s New Collegiate \nDictionary (1949) (\u201cTo discard; dismiss. To reserve \nfor a purpose. To annul.\u201d). \n\u2022 \u201cSuspend\u201d is also an equitable \u201cterm[] of art\u201d \nmeaning to \u201crestrict or stop official action.\u201d Direct \nMktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 2 (2015). \nBecause each of these terms denotes a specific kind of \nequitable relief, the canon of noscitur a sociis confirms \nthat \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d is best read to do the same. \nSee Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 371 (1994) \n(\u201cThat several items in a list share an attribute counsels in \nfavor of interpreting the other items as possessing that \nattribute as well.\u201d). It denotes a specific kind of equitable \nrelief of its own. See, e.g., Brohl, 575 U.S. at 12 (applying \nthe canon to narrowly read the word \u201crestrain,\u201d in \u201cenjoin, \nsuspend or restrain,\u201d to mean another form of equitable \nrelief). And the only form of equitable relief that \n\u201cdetermines the validity\u201d of a regulation or statute is a \ndeclaratory judgment. See PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (noting that court can make \nthis determination \u201conly by entering a declaratory \njudgment\u201d); see, e.g., Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740, \n746 (1998) (noting that the Declaratory Judgment Act \npermits a court to \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of a legal \ninstrument); Ry. Mail Ass\u2019n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 91 \n(1945) (noting that the plaintiff sought \u201ca declaratory \njudgment to determine the validity\u201d of a statute). \n\n \n-24- \nIf the phrase were given a broader sweep, as the \nNinth Circuit has given it, the other terms specifically \nlisted in section 2342 would become superfluous. A court \ntypically cannot \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d or \u201csuspend\u201d an \nagency order without at least \u201cconsidering\u201d its reasoning, \nwhich the Ninth Circuit has held that district courts may \nnot do. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s expansive reading of \n\u201cdetermine the validity\u201d thus cannot be reconciled with \nthe Court\u2019s \u201cduty to give effect, if possible, to every clause \nand word of a statute.\u201d Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, \n174 (2001). Were this Court to adopt that reading here, it \nwould ascribe to the phrase \u201ca meaning so broad that it is \ninconsistent with the company it keeps,\u201d violating \u201cthe \nbasic logic that Congress would not go to the trouble of \nspelling out the list in [section 2342] if a neighboring term \nswallowed it up.\u201d Fischer, 603 U.S at 487, 490. That \n\u201cunintended breadth\u201d is precisely the evil that noscitur a \nsociis is designed to prevent. Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., \n367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961). So even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nexpansive definition were a plausible interpretation of the \nphrase taken in isolation, reading it in context would \nrequire rejecting that definition. See United States v. \nHansen, 599 U.S. 762, 775 (2023) (\u201cWhen words have \nseveral plausible definitions, context differentiates among \nthem.\u201d). \nFurther textual support, if it were needed, appears in \nthe only other place in the Hobbs Act where Congress \nused a variation of the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity.\u201d \nSee Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 570 (1995) \n(noting that the \u201cnormal rule of statutory construction [is] \nthat identical words used in different parts of the same act \nare intended to have the same meaning.\u201d). In section \n2349(a), Congress authorized the courts of appeals to \n\n \n-25- \nenter \u201ca judgment determining the validity of, and \nenjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in whole or in part, \nthe order of the agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2349(a) (emphasis \nadded). That language provides additional confirmation \nthat Congress intended the determination of an order\u2019s \nvalidity to be an equitable remedy awarded through a \ndeclaratory \u201cjudgment\u201d in a facial challenge that \nestablishes the order\u2019s validity as to everyone.  \nOther provisions back up this understanding by \nsetting forth procedures for obtaining those judgments, \nrequiring, for example, that a \u201cpetition for review\u201d be filed \n\u201cwithin 60 days\u201d of entry of the challenged order, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2344, that the action must be brought \u201cagainst \nthe United States,\u201d id., and that it be filed \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its principal \noffice\u201d or in the D.C. Circuit, id. \u00a7 2343.  \n4. This understanding of the phrase \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity\u201d is also the most consistent with \u201cthe law\u2019s object \nand design.\u201d U.S. Nat\u2019l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents \nof Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 462 (1993). \u201cThe point of the \nHobbs Act is to force parties who want to challenge \nagency orders via facial, pre-enforcement challenges to do \nso promptly and to do so in a court of appeals,\u201d thus \navoiding \u201cthe delays and uncertainty that otherwise would \nresult from multiple pre-enforcement proceedings \u2026 in \nmultiple district courts and courts of appeals.\u201d PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 13 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) \n(emphasis added). The Act achieves this by channeling \npre-enforcement challenges to agency orders directly to \nthe courts of appeals and by consolidating multiple \npetitions challenging the same law into a single court. See \nid.; 28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). But that goal is not advanced by \nbarring district courts from interpreting statutes in \n\n \n-26- \nlitigation between private parties alleging that a \ndefendant violated a statute. Such a rule would only create \ninefficiencies and conflicts in routine litigation, while \ndoing nothing to further Congress\u2019s intent to streamline \nchallenges to agency action. \n5. The opposite conclusion\u2014that the Hobbs Act can \noperate to preclude a district court from interpreting a \nstatute in a private, as-applied litigation\u2014would lead to \nabsurd results. For one thing, it would prevent the court \nfrom interpreting and applying statutory language as \nwritten when doing so would conflict with an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation. See Miller v. FCC, 66 F.3d 1140, 1144 (11th \nCir. 1995) (\u201cCongress has not delegated, and could not \ndelegate, the power to any agency to oust state courts and \nfederal district courts of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d). \nOnce the Hobbs Act\u2019s 60-day window closes, district \ncourts \u201cwould have to afford the agency not mere \nSkidmore deference or Chevron deference, but absolute \ndeference.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring).  At that point, \u201cno one is able to argue in court \nthat the regulation is inconsistent with the statute\u2014no \nmatter how wrong the agency\u2019s interpretation might be.\u201d \nId. at 26\u201327. That is not deference; it\u2019s \u201cabdication.\u201d Id. at \n27.  \nThe \u201cstark implication[]\u201d of that rule would be that \u201ca \nplaintiff with a viable claim under the law Congress \nenacted may be unable to pursue it simply because an \nagency has misinterpreted the law in an order to which he \nwas not a party.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., LP, \n931 F.3d 1094, 1109 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). And defendants haled into court to defend \nagainst claims that they violated the TCPA would likewise \nbe disabled from challenging the FCC order being \n\n \n-27- \nenforced against them, making their claims or defenses \nunilaterally subject to whatever position the FCC has \ntaken\u2014no matter how wrong. \nAn agency order that deprives district courts of the \nability to even consider whether an agency\u2019s statutory \ninterpretation is wrongly decided would also \u201cestop[] vast \nnumbers\u201d of parties who \u201cmight wish to advance a view of \nthe law different from that of the agency.\u201d Id. at 1110. \nBecause the Hobbs Act\u2019s 60-day window typically closes \nlong before enforcement actions arise, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nrule \u201cwould effectively deny many parties ultimately \naffected by a rule an opportunity to question its validity.\u201d \nFunctional Music, Inc. v. FCC, 274 F.2d 543, 546 (D.C. \nCir. 1958). Even worse, the rule would bind people who \nwere not yet born and companies that were not yet created \nbefore the time to challenge the order expired. PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 18 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \n\u201cIt would be wholly impractical\u2014and a huge waste of \nresources\u2014to expect and require every potentially \naffected party to bring pre-enforcement Hobbs Act \nchallenges against every agency order that might possibly \naffect them in the future.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 18 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). For most of these potential \nparties, \u201cthe ultimate impact, or even the likelihood of \nenforcement, of proposed rules may be far from clear.\u201d \nGage v. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1218 \n(D.C. Cir. 1973). It \u201cis totally unrealistic to assume that \nmore than a fraction of the persons and entities affected \nby a regulation \u2026 would have knowledge of its \npromulgation or familiarity with or access to the Federal \nRegister.\u201d Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U.S. \n275, 290 (1978) (Powell, J., concurring). Much less can \nordinary consumers be expected to scrutinize the FCC\u2019s \n\n \n-28- \ndocket to protect themselves in the event they someday \nhave a claim under the TCPA. \u201cRequiring all those \npotentially affected parties to bring a facial, pre-\nenforcement challenge within 60 days or otherwise forfeit \ntheir right to challenge an agency\u2019s interpretation of a \nstatute borders on the absurd.\u201d Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1110 \n(Pryor, J., concurring). That is no doubt why Congress \nalmost never imposes such a harsh requirement.  \nB. If any ambiguity remains, the strong \npresumption of reviewability still requires \nreversal. \n1. Even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s extraordinarily broad \nreading of \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d were a plausible \nreading of that phrase in context, it still would not be the \nonly plausible reading. At a minimum, the phrase is also \nsusceptible to the alternative reading adopted by four \nJustices of this Court in PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). And an ambiguous statute, \nas Justice Kavanaugh explained, cannot \u201cdeprive a party \nof judicial review of the agency\u2019s interpretation in an \nenforcement action.\u201d Id. at 22; see also Kucana v. Holder, \n558 U.S. 233, 251 (2010) (Where a statute is \u201creasonably \nsusceptible to divergent interpretation,\u201d the Court \n\u201cadopt[s] the reading that accords with traditional \nunderstandings and basic principles: that executive \ndeterminations generally are subject to judicial review.\u201d). \nRecognizing that \u201cCongress rarely intends to prevent \ncourts from enforcing its directives to federal agencies,\u201d \nthis Court \u201capplies a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 favoring \njudicial review\u201d of an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. \nMach Mining, LLC v. E.E.O.C., 575 U.S. 480, 486 (2015). \nThat review will be allowed unless \u201cthere is persuasive \nreason to believe\u201d that Congress intended to preclude it. \n\n \n-29- \nBowen v. Mich. Acad. of Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, \n670 \n(1986). \nMoreover, \nCongress \ncodified \nthat \n\u201ctraditional[]\u201d rule in the APA, which provides that \n\u201cagency action\u201d is generally \u201csubject to judicial review in \ncivil or criminal proceedings for judicial enforcement.\u201d 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 703. This provision \u201ccreates a basic presumption \nof judicial review for one suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action.\u201d Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife \nServ., 586 U.S. 9, 22 (2018). The \u201cstrong presumption that \nCongress intends judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nBowen, 476 U.S. at 670, counsels against construing the \nHobbs \nAct \nto \npreclude \nreview \nof \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \ninterpretation.5 \nTo overcome that presumption, courts \u201ccannot \npresume that Congress silently intended to preclude \njudicial review.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 19 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \u201cWhen Congress intends to \neliminate \nas-applied \njudicial \nreview \nof \nagency \ninterpretations of statutes in enforcement actions, \nCongress can, must, and does speak clearly.\u201d Id. And in \nthe absence of any such language, the well-established \n \n5 Judicial review under the APA is available whenever no \u201cprior, \nadequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial review is provided by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 (emphasis added). That provision for review is \ntriggered here because the Hobbs Act does not provide an \u201cexclusive\u201d \nopportunity for review in cases like this one. Although the Act gives \nthe courts of appeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over certain cases, the \nrelevant question\u2014as Justice Kavanaugh explained in PDR \nNetwork\u2014is \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to do what?\u201d 588 U.S. at 20 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). The answer is that the Act grants courts \nof appeals exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto issue an injunction or declaratory \njudgment regarding the agency\u2019s order\u201d in a pre-enforcement facial \nchallenge\u2014not to resolve disputes in cases between private parties \nover an alleged statutory violation. Id. at 21. \n\n \n-30- \n\u201cdefault rule\u201d is to allow parties in private litigation \u201cto \nargue that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is \nwrong.\u201d Id.  \n2. Because the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent about review in \nsubsequent enforcement actions,\u201d the \u201cdefault rule \u2026 \napplies absent statutory language to the contrary.\u201d Id. at \n15. As explained above, petitions to review under the \nHobbs Act are brought against the government and are \nlimited to injunctive and declaratory remedies. So it \nmakes sense that the court of appeals would have \nexclusive \njurisdiction \nto \n\u201centertain \nfacial, \npre-\nenforcement challenges\u201d to agency orders. Id. at 24. Thus, \nnobody disputes that this exclusive jurisdiction \u201cmeans, at \na minimum, that an aggrieved party may not bring a facial, \npre-enforcement action \u2026 in a district court.\u201d Id. at 20.  \nBut that\u2019s the only kind of proceeding that the Hobbs \nAct restricts. The Act does not mention any other kinds of \ncases\u2014like suits between private parties based on alleged \nviolations of the TCPA \u2014and thus does not vest the courts \nof appeals with \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over such run-of-\nthe-mill disputes. The Act has nothing to say about the \nauthority of district courts to adjudicate ordinary civil \ncases, where the United States is not a party and no \ninjunctive or declaratory relief against it is sought. The \nHobbs Act gives the courts of appeals no jurisdiction to \nadjudicate private litigation alleging violations of a \nstatute. There is \u201cno basis to interpret a silent statute as \nachieving that extraordinary close-the-courthouse-door \noutcome.\u201d Id. at 26. Nor is there any other \u201creason to think \nthat Congress wanted to short-circuit that ordinary \nsystem of judicial review for the many agencies and \n\n \n-31- \nmultiplicity of agency orders encompassed by the Hobbs \nAct.\u201d Id.6 \nAnd in these \u201cas-applied enforcement action[s],\u201d which \nthe Hobbs Act leaves in place, the district courts are \noperating outside the courts of appeals\u2019 exclusive \njurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges and are \u201cnot \nbound by the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA.\u201d Id. at \n12. Instead, they are free to \u201cinterpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation.\u201d Id. at 27. They are, in fact, \nobligated to do so; the federal courts \u201chave no more right \nto decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than \nto usurp that which is not given.\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 19 \nU.S. 264, 404 (1821) (Marshall, J.). \nIn this way, the Hobbs Act is one of a host of agency \nreview statutes creating jurisdiction in the courts of \nappeals over a particular kind of proceeding: facial, pre-\nenforcement suits against the United States seeking \ninjunctive or declaratory relief from particular kinds of \nagency action. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(b)(3) (providing \nfor \u201cexclusive\u201d review of SEC orders in the courts of \nappeal); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f) (providing for review of OSHA \n \n6 That is not to say that a party who loses a pre-enforcement \nfacial challenge under the Hobbs Act can necessarily obtain a second \nbite of the apple. \u201cIf a party challenges an agency action in a facial, \npre-enforcement suit, that specific party may be barred by ordinary \npreclusion principles from relitigating the same question against the \nagency in a future enforcement action.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 \nn.2 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); see Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S. 136, 154 (1967). But, as in PDR Network, \u201c[t]hat scenario is not \npresent here because [McLaughlin] did not bring a facial, pre-\nenforcement suit.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring).  \n\n \n-32- \norders). The Act\u2019s grant of exclusive jurisdiction means \nthat a district court may not entertain a petition to review \nan FCC order subject to the Act. But the Act says nothing \nabout other actions, like this one, that are properly filed in \na federal district court under the court\u2019s ordinary federal-\nquestion jurisdiction. \nFor example, the Hobbs Act subjects certain SEC \norders to the courts of appeals\u2019 \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction \nover pre-enforcement actions. See PDR Network, 588 U.S. \nat 21 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But \u201cthat provision has \nnever been read to bar subsequent district court review of \nthe SEC\u2019s interpretation of a statute in an enforcement \nproceeding.\u201d Id. at 21\u201322. On the contrary, this Court and \nothers often consider\u2014and sometimes credit\u2014arguments \nthat the agency got it wrong on the law. See Ernst & Ernst \nv. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 212\u201314 (1976) (holding that the \nSEC\u2019s interpretation of Rule 10b-5 was inconsistent with \nstatutory text); see also, e.g., United States v. O\u2019Hagan, \n521 U.S. 642, 666\u201376 (1997) (upholding SEC rule); SEC v. \nAlpine Sec. Corp., 308 F. Supp. 3d 775, 795\u201396 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018). Likewise, occupational safety and health standards \nare directly reviewable in the courts of appeals, see 29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 655(f), but that has not stopped courts in the \nenforcement context from considering their correctness. \nSee, e.g., Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.S. 1, 4, 7\u20139 \n(1980) (examining \u201cwhether this regulation is consistent \nwith the Act\u201d). \n3. To say all this is not to deny that \u201cCongress can \nexpressly preclude as-applied review in enforcement \nactions (subject to constitutional constraints).\u201d PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 26 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). It \ncan do so\u2014and in other statutes, it has done so. When it \nwants to, Congress \u201cknows how to explicitly preclude \n\n \n-33- \njudicial review,\u201d \u201cas it has done with the Clean Water Act, \nCERCLA, and the Clean Air Act.\u201d Id. at 16, 26. \nBut \u201cCongress traditionally takes the extraordinary \nstep of barring as-applied review\u201d only for \u201cstatutory \nschemes where the regulated parties are likely to be well \naware of any agency rules and to have both the incentive \nand the capacity to challenge\u201d them. Id. at 18. Like the \nHobbs Act, these statutes \u201cauthorize facial, pre-\nenforcement judicial review\u201d in the courts of appeals. Id. \nat 14. They also, however, go further than the Hobbs Act \nby including language that \u201cexpressly preclude[s] judicial \nreview in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 16\u201317. \nFor example, the Clean Water Act (like the Hobbs \nAct) \u201cprovides for facial, pre-enforcement review of \ncertain agency actions in a court of appeals.\u201d Id. at 14; see \n33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1). But unlike the Hobbs Act, the \nstatute \u201cexpressly states that those agency orders \u2018shall \nnot be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal \nproceeding for enforcement.\u2019\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at \n14 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (quoting 33 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1369(b)(2)); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(a) (CERCLA) \n(stating that agency orders \u201cshall not be subject to judicial \nreview in any civil or criminal proceeding for \nenforcement\u201d); id. \u00a7 7607(b)(2) (Clean Air Act) (stating \nthat agency orders \u201cshall not be subject to judicial review \nin civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement\u201d). \nOther statutes, by contrast, \u201cauthorize facial, pre-\nenforcement judicial review, but are silent on the question \nwhether a party may argue against the agency\u2019s legal \ninterpretation in subsequent enforcement proceedings.\u201d \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 14\u201315 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring). The Hobbs Act, which says nothing about \nreview in the district courts, is one of these. \u201cUnlike the \n\n \n-34- \nClean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act, the \nHobbs Act does not expressly preclude review in \nenforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320. The \u201cfact that \nCongress has expressly precluded judicial review\u201d in \nsimilar statutes \u201csuggests that Congress\u2019s silence in the \nHobbs Act should not be read to preclude judicial review.\u201d \nId. at 16\u201317. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Yakus v. United States, 321 \nU.S. 414 (1944), reinforces the point. There, the Court held \nthat specific language in the Emergency Price Control Act \nprecluded district courts from considering the validity of \nwartime price regulations in as-applied enforcement \nactions. Like the Hobbs Act, that statute granted \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to a court of appeals \u201cto determine \nthe validity of any regulation or order\u201d by the agency \ncharged with administering the statute. Id. at 429. As \nJustice Kavanaugh explained, this \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d \nprovision, which \u201cis roughly akin to the language in the \nHobbs Act,\u201d gave the \u201ccourt exclusive jurisdiction to \ndecide a facial, pre-enforcement challenge\u201d but \u201cdid not on \nits own bar any subsequent review in as-applied \nenforcement actions.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 23\u201324 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  \nInstead, it was the law\u2019s second sentence\u2014\u201ccoupled \nwith\u201d its exclusive-jurisdiction provision\u2014that \u201ctogether\u201d \naccomplished that result. Id. at 23. In the ECPA, after \ngranting the court of appeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \ndecide facial challenges, Congress explicitly provided that \nno other court had jurisdiction even \u201cto consider\u201d those \nsame agency orders in an as-applied enforcement \n\n \n-35- \nproceeding. Id. at 23;7 see also U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., Just. \nManual \u00a7 10 (1947) (citing this provision as a provision that \n\u201cexpressly \u2026 preclude[d] challenge of agency action in \nenforcement proceedings\u201d). But that language, which is \n\u201croughly akin to the preclusion of review provisions in the \nmodern Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and Clean Air Act,\u201d \nis \u201cnot replicated in the Hobbs Act.\u201d PDR Network, 588 \nU.S. at 23 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nThat Congress chose six years later when it enacted \nthe Hobbs Act \u201cnot [to] include the language from the \nEmergency Price Control Act\u201d\u2014which, \u201cas interpreted in \nYakus, would have expressly communicated Congress\u2019s \nintent to preclude district courts from considering\u201d \nchallenges to certain regulations\u2014is additional strong \nevidence that Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to \ncarry such a meaning. Id. at 24. \n4. Even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the \nHobbs Act were left standing as a plausible contender, the \nconstitutional-doubt canon would come into play and \ncompel an alternative reading to avoid the \u201cserious \nconstitutional issue[s]\u201d that would be raised by this \ninterpretation. Id. at 19; see Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1106 \n(Pryor, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nJustice \nThomas, \nwriting \nseparately in PDR Network, noted that \u201cconstitutional-\n \n7 In full, the second sentence read: \u201cExcept as provided in this \nsection, no court, Federal, State, or Territorial, shall have jurisdiction \nor power to consider the validity of any such regulation, order, or price \nschedule, or to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside, in whole or in part, \nany provision of this Act authorizing the issuance of such regulations \nor orders, or making effective any such price schedule, or any \nprovision of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, or to \nrestrain or enjoin the enforcement of any such provision.\u201d Yakus, 321 \nU.S. at 429. \n\n \n-36- \navoidance precedents would militate against\u201d interpreting \nthe statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit has done. \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 9\u201310 (Thomas, J., concurring). \nFor one thing, \u201c[b]arring defendants in as-applied \nenforcement actions from raising arguments about the \nreach and authority of agency rules enforced against them \nraises significant questions under the Due Process \nClause.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 19 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring); see also Chrysler Corp. v. EPA, 600 F.2d 904, \n913 (1979) (noting that doing so raises a \u201csubstantial due \nprocess question\u201d); Adamo Wrecking, 434 U.S. at 289 \n(Powell, J. concurring) (noting that the constitutional \nissues \u201cmerit[] serious consideration\u201d). This Court \u201ccan \navoid some of those due process concerns by adhering to \na default rule of permitting judicial review of agency legal \ninterpretations in enforcement actions.\u201d PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 19 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).8 \nRequiring district courts to resolve statutory-violation \ncases without considering the statute also raises troubling \nseparation-of-powers concerns. If a district court \u201ccould \nnever second-guess agency interpretations in orders \n \n8 This Court in Yakus upheld the constitutionality of the \nEmergency Price Control Act, which precluded district courts from \nconsidering the validity of wartime price regulations as a defense to \nenforcement actions. 321 U.S. at 414. But Yakus was decided at the \nheight of the United States\u2019 involvement in World War II, when \u201cthe \nneed for quick and definitive judicial rulings on the legality of agency \norders was at its apex.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 24\u201325 (Kavanaugh, \nJ., concurring). The Court in Yakus found it \u201cappropriate to take into \naccount\u201d these exigent circumstances and the fact that the law was \u201ca \ntemporary wartime measure.\u201d 321 U.S. at 419, 431-32. But it has never \nsuggested that the same rule is appropriate in peacetime. See United \nStates v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 838 n.15 (1987) (noting that \nYakus was \u201cmotivated by the exigencies of wartime\u201d). \n\n \n-37- \nsubject to the Hobbs Act,\u201d Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1110\u201311, the \nAct could intrude \u201cupon Article III\u2019s vesting of the \n\u2018judicial Power\u2019 in the courts,\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at \n9 (Thomas, J., concurring). As Justice Thomas opined in \nhis concurrence in PDR Network, \u201cthe judicial power, as \noriginally understood,\u201d requires a court to \u201cexercise its \nindependent judgment in interpreting and expounding \nupon the laws,\u201d which \u201cnecessarily entails identifying and \napplying [] governing law.\u201d Id. at 9\u201310. Thus, if \u201cthe Hobbs \nAct purports to prevent courts from applying the \ngoverning statute to a case or controversy within its \njurisdiction, the Act conflicts with the \u2018province and duty \nof the judicial department to say what the law is.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n10 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, \n177 (1803)).  \nAt any rate, even if the statute were not actually \nunconstitutional under the Ninth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s view, that is \nnot the test for applying the constitutional-doubt canon. \nThe test is whether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view would \u201craise[] \na substantial constitutional question.\u201d Peretz v. United \nStates, 501 U.S. 923, 930 (1991); see Antonin Scalia & \nBryan Garner, Reading Law 247\u201348 (2012) (\u201c[The \nconstitutional-doubt canon] militates against not only \nthose interpretations that would render the statute \nunconstitutional but also those that would even raise \nserious questions of constitutionality.\u201d). It would here. \nII. At a minimum, the district court was not required \nto accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation because the \nagency\u2019s order is non-binding interpretive \nguidance.  \nThe Hobbs Act did not require the district court in \nthis case to accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the \nTCPA for an additional reason. Even if the Ninth Circuit \n\n \n-38- \nwere correct that the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d \nlanguage precludes as-applied judicial review of an \nagency\u2019s legislative rules, which may bind courts and \nprivate parties, it cannot be the case that the same is true \nfor an agency\u2019s interpretive guidance and policy \nstatements, which do not. Here, the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors \norder is quintessential interpretive guidance. Under basic \nprinciples of administrative law, the district court was \ntherefore not bound by it but was free to exercise its \nArticle III authority to construe the TCPA for itself.9 \nA. Although it did not \u201cdefinitively resolve the issue,\u201d \nthis Court in PDR Network noted that if an FCC order is \n\u201cthe equivalent of an interpretive rule,\u201d it \u201cmay not be \nbinding on a district court, and [the] district court \ntherefore may not be required to adhere to it.\u201d 588 U.S. at \n7. Unlike every other court of appeals that has considered \nthe question, the Ninth Circuit treats \u201clegislative\u201d and \n\u201cinterpretive\u201d rules in exactly the same way under the \nHobbs Act; both are binding on district courts in as-\napplied enforcement proceedings. See Hamilton, 224 F.3d \nat 1055 (holding that the Hobbs Act \u201ccontains no exception \nfor \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules\u201d). Following that binding circuit \nprecedent, the district court in this case recognized that \nany \u201cpotential distinction between \u2018legislative\u2019 and \n\u2018interpretive\u2019 rules [did] not matter.\u201d Pet. App. 37a\u201338a & \nn.5. And the Ninth Circuit agreed, holding that the district \ncourt had \u201ccorrectly found\u201d that it was bound by the \nFCC\u2019s order regardless of whether it was legislative or \n \n9 Unlike in PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 7, this issue was argued \nbelow, decided by the court of appeals, and raised in the petition for \ncertiorari. Pet App. 7a, 37a\u201338a & n.5. So there is no basis to remand \nfor consideration of the issue here. \n\n \n-39- \ninterpretive. Pet. App. 7a. That understanding of the \nHobbs Act cannot be right. \nThe distinguishing characteristic of legislative rules is \nthat they are \u201cissued by an agency pursuant to statutory \nauthority\u201d and have the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 7. They are therefore binding on \ncourts, private parties, and the issuing agency itself. See \nChrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 295 (1979); Perez \nv. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96\u201397 (2015). \nLegislative rules, unlike interpretive ones, must go \nthrough the notice-and-comment procedures prescribed \nby the APA. See Perez, 575 U.S. at 97. By contrast, \ninterpretive rules \u201cdo not have the force and effect of law \nand are not accorded that weight in the adjudicatory \nprocess.\u201d Id. They do not create new rights or obligations \nand are not subject to the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment \nrequirements. See id. Rather, their \u201ccritical feature\u201d is \nthat they are \u201cissued by an agency to advise the public of \nthe agency\u2019s construction of the statutes and rules which \nit administers.\u201d Id. Interpretive rules, therefore, cannot \n\u201cbind private parties.\u201d Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 583 \n(2019) (plurality opinion). \nAs all parties to this case agreed below, the FCC\u2019s \nAmerifactors order is interpretive, not legislative. SER \n082. By its terms, the order is a \u201cclarification\u201d that \n\u201cinterpret[s]\u201d the TCPA\u2019s definition of \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d Pet. App. 51a. The FCC did not \npurport to impose new obligations or recognize new \nrights. Instead, it concluded that an \u201conline fax service\u201d \n\u201cfalls outside the scope of the statutory prohibition.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 48a. The order thus simply \u201cadvise[s] the public of \nthe agency\u2019s construction of the statutes and rules which \nit administers\u201d\u2014a \u201cprototypical interpretive rule.\u201d \n\n \n-40- \nShalala v. Guernsey Mem\u2019l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99 (1995); \nsee also Kisor, 588 U.S. at 583 (noting that interpretive \nrules reflect \u201chow the agency understands, and is likely to \napply, its binding statutes\u201d) (plurality opinion); White v. \nShalala, 7 F.3d 296, 303 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting that an \ninterpretive rule reflects an agency\u2019s \u201ctentative view of \nthe meaning of a particular statutory term\u201d). \nB. Because interpretive rules lack the force of law, \nthey can never bind parties and courts\u2014the Hobbs Act \nnotwithstanding. The Act gives the courts of appeals \nexclusive jurisdiction to \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of \ncovered agency orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. But whether an \ninterpretive rule is \u201cvalid\u201d or not makes no difference to \nits advisory nature. Although legislative rules are binding \nonly if valid, interpretive rules and policy statements are \nnon-binding on courts and parties \u201cregardless of their \nvalidity.\u201d Viet. Veterans of Am., 843 F.2d at 537. Unlike \nlegislative rules, interpretive rules can be both \u201cvalid\u201d and \n\u201cnon-binding\u201d with no \u201ccontradiction in terms.\u201d Id. \nThere was thus no need for the district court to \n\u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of the Amerifactors order. \nWhether valid or not, \u201ca court is not required to give effect \nto an interpretive regulation.\u201d Batterton v. Francis, 432 \nU.S. 416, 424\u201326 & n.9 (1977); see Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, 982 F.3d at 263 (holding that an FCC order\u2019s \n\u201cinterpretive nature means that the district court was not \nbound to follow it\u201d). Although \u201ccourts often defer to an \nagency\u2019s interpretative rule,\u201d \u201cthey are always free to \nchoose otherwise.\u201d Joseph v. U.S. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 554 \nF.2d 1140, 1154 n.26 (D.C. Cir. 1977); see also Carlton & \nHarris Chiropractic, 982 F.3d at 264. And it would make \nno sense to say that a district court can\u2019t question the \ncorrectness of a rule\u2019s statutory interpretation that\u2019s not \n\n \n-41- \nbinding in the first place. As the government \nacknowledged at oral argument in PDR Network, \ninterpretive rules are \u201cwithout the force of law\u201d and thus \ndon\u2019t \u201cfall within the Hobbs Act at all.\u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 64. \nCourts outside the Ninth Circuit have consistently \nrecognized this limitation. The Fourth Circuit, on remand \nin PDR Network, held that the FCC order at issue was \n\u201cinterpretive,\u201d rather than \u201clegislative,\u201d and thus outside \nthe Hobbs Act. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, 982 F.3d \nat 262\u201363. Because interpretive rules \u201cdo not have the \nforce and effect of law and are not accorded that weight in \nthe adjudicatory process,\u201d the court concluded, they \ncannot bind district courts in private enforcement actions. \nId. at 264 (holding that, because the \u201cFCC Rule is \ninterpretive,\u201d the \u201cdistrict court wasn\u2019t bound by it\u201d). \nSeveral other circuits have followed suit. For \nexample, after recognizing that this Court in PDR \nNetwork \u201csuggested that the FCC\u2019s interpretive rulings \nmay not bind courts when they construe the TCPA,\u201d the \nThird Circuit refused to treat such rulings as binding \nauthority. Panzarella v. Navient Sols., Inc., 37 F.4th 867, \n873 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022). The Second and Eighth Circuits \nhave done the same. See Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 End, \nInc., 997 F.3d 470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021) (finding the \nFCC\u2019s \ninterpretation \n\u201cpersuasive\u201d \nonly \nafter \nindependently interpreting the statutory text); Golan v. \nFreeEats.com, Inc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019) \n(\u201cWe agree with the FCC not because we believe we are \nbound to do so but because we find this portion of their \ninterpretation of the statute to be persuasive.\u201d). \nTo hold otherwise would bring about the bizarre \nresult that an agency\u2019s informal, non-binding guidance \nwould, after 60 days, become permanently unchallenge-\n\n \n-42- \nable, in effect \u201ctransform[ing] \u2026 into the equivalent of a \nstatute.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring). It would be anomalous to hold that an agency \nlegal opinion whose authority is limited to its \u201cpower to \npersuade,\u201d Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 256 (2006), \nwould nevertheless become binding on district courts\u2014\neven when the agency\u2019s analysis is obviously wrong. It \nwould also undermine the agency\u2019s own decision to issue, \nfor example, a non-binding policy statement\u2014only to find \nit entitled to \u201c[n]ot Skidmore deference or Chevron \ndeference,\u201d but the equivalent of judicial \u201cabdication.\u201d \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nThat cannot be the law. There is nothing in the text, \nstructure, or history of the Hobbs Act that even hints at \nthe possibility that Congress would have intended to bring \nabout such a bizarre result. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about the likely outcome of this case remain stable, as the latest observation was an internal reasoning step (\"THINK\" action) rather than new external evidence. It confirmed the strategic need to analyze the petitioner's arguments but did not provide those arguments. Therefore, my current understanding, shaped heavily by the Solicitor General's amicus brief, is preserved.\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow:** The case remains centered on the question left open in ***PDR Network***: Does the Hobbs Act compel district courts to treat FCC legal interpretations of the TCPA as binding? The grant of certiorari confirms the Court's interest in resolving this question.\n\n*   **Dominant Factor (Unchanged): The Solicitor General's Intervention:** The SG's amicus brief in support of the respondent (McKesson) remains the most significant piece of evidence for predicting the merits outcome. It provides the Court with two distinct and powerful paths to rule against the petitioner, and my assessment of these paths is unchanged.\n\n    *   **Path 1: The Procedural \"Off-Ramp\" (Vacate & Remand):** The SG's primary argument\u2014that the FCC Bureau's *Amerifactors* order was not a \"final order\" subject to the Hobbs Act because it was under review by the full Commission\u2014remains a highly attractive, narrow basis for the Court to dispose of the case. This would be a procedural loss for the petitioner and would avoid a ruling on the difficult merits question that previously fractured the Court. My belief that this is a high-probability outcome is stable.\n\n    *   **Path 2: The Merits \"Brick Wall\" (Affirm):** The SG's alternative argument on the merits\u2014that the Hobbs Act's plain text and purpose, supported by precedents like ***Yakus v. United States***, unambiguously bar collateral attacks on agency orders in district courts\u2014also remains a strong foundation for an affirmance. This would resolve the circuit split in favor of the respondent.\n\n*   **Acknowledged Information Gap:** The recent \"THINK\" observation does not alter my beliefs, but it brings a critical aspect of my uncertainty into sharp focus. My current prediction is based almost entirely on the arguments presented by the respondent and the Solicitor General. I have not yet processed the petitioner's counterarguments. My analysis is therefore one-sided. The strength of the petitioner's rebuttal to the SG's procedural (finality) and substantive (Hobbs Act interpretation) arguments is the largest remaining variable. Until I observe the petitioner's merits brief, my confidence in the current prediction, while directionally strong (favoring the respondent), is provisional. The petitioner could potentially expose a flaw in the SG's \"finality\" argument or present a compelling textual or historical case for their interpretation of the Hobbs Act that I have not yet considered.\n\n*   **Revised Prediction & Confidence (Stable):** My prediction remains that the petitioner is highly likely to lose, but the form of that loss is the main question.\n    1.  **High Probability Outcome:** Vacatur and remand on procedural grounds (the *Amerifactors* order was not final).\n    2.  **Secondary High Probability Outcome:** Affirmance on the merits (the Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks).\n\nThe path to victory for the petitioner still appears exceedingly narrow, but a full evaluation of its viability awaits an analysis of their direct response to the government's formidable arguments.",

It perfectly models a crucial loop in BOED: 1) assimilate new data (petitioner's brief), 2) update prior beliefs, 3) identify the most significant remaining uncertainty (how the respondent will rebut specific arguments), and 4) formulate a plan to resolve that uncertainty (obtain the respondent's brief).

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has significantly evolved with the introduction of the petitioner's merits brief. While my prior beliefs, shaped by the Solicitor General's arguments, remain relevant as the respondent's likely position, they are now counterbalanced by a robust and well-articulated set of arguments from the petitioner. The case appears far more competitive than I initially assessed.\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow (Refined):** The case remains centered on the Hobbs Act question left unresolved in ***PDR Network***. However, the petitioner's brief has sharpened the focus, framing the conflict not just as a question of preclusion, but as a fundamental question about the nature of judicial power in private litigation versus direct review of agency action. The petitioner's strategy of explicitly and repeatedly invoking Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network* is a powerful signal, suggesting a clear effort to solidify a pre-existing bloc of four justices and persuade a fifth.\n\n*   **New Information (Petitioner's Arguments):** The petitioner's brief, which I had previously identified as a critical information gap, presents two primary arguments that directly challenge the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and the anticipated arguments from the respondent/SG.\n\n    *   **Argument 1: The Hobbs Act Doesn't Apply to Private Damages Actions.** This is the petitioner's main thrust.\n        *   **Textual/Canon-Based Claim:** They argue the phrase \"enjoin, set aside, suspend... or to determine the validity of\" in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 refers exclusively to forms of equitable relief sought in a direct challenge to an agency. Applying the *noscitur a sociis* canon, \"determine the validity of\" should be read as a specific remedy (a declaratory judgment) akin to the other listed remedies, not as a broad prohibition on district courts interpreting the law.\n        *   **Structural Claim:** The Hobbs Act is a standard \"jurisdiction-channeling\" statute designed to route pre-enforcement challenges against an agency to the courts of appeals. It is silent about, and its legislative history suggests it was not intended to affect, the adjudication of private rights of action for money damages, where the court's primary task is to interpret the underlying statute (the TCPA). This directly counters the respondent's expected \"collateral attack\" argument.\n\n    *   **Argument 2 (Fallback): The FCC Order is Non-Binding Interpretive Guidance.** This provides the Court with a narrow \"off-ramp\" to rule for the petitioner.\n        *   **Nature of the Rule:** The petitioner asserts that the FCC order at issue is an \"interpretive rule,\" not a legislative one with the force of law. It merely advises the public of the agency's view.\n        *   **Legal Effect:** Citing precedent like ***Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association***, they argue that interpretive rules can never be binding on courts, regardless of what the Hobbs Act says. A court cannot be \"bound\" by something that lacks the force of law in the first place. This argument directly engages one of the key questions the *PDR Network* majority remanded on.\n\n*   **Revised Assessment of Competing \"Off-Ramps\":** The strategic landscape is now defined by competing narrow grounds for a decision, in addition to the broad merits question.\n    *   **Petitioner's Off-Ramp:** The FCC order is merely interpretive and thus not binding.\n    *   **SG's Off-Ramp (from prior belief):** The FCC order was not \"final\" when issued and thus not subject to the Hobbs Act.\n    *   The existence of these two distinct, narrow, procedural/substantive paths to a decision increases the likelihood that the Court may again avoid a definitive ruling on the Hobbs Act's broad preclusive effect, similar to the remand in *PDR Network*.\n\n*   **Revised Prediction & Confidence (Shifted):** My confidence in a victory for the respondent (McKesson) has decreased substantially. The petitioner has presented a compelling case that is textually grounded and strategically aligned with a known judicial philosophy on the Court. The path to victory for the petitioner is no longer \"exceedingly narrow.\"\n\n    1.  **High Probability of a Complex Decision:** The outcome is now highly uncertain. The petitioner's textual argument based on *noscitur a sociis* is strong and directly confronts the respondent's jurisdictional argument.\n    2.  **Plausible Outcomes:**\n        *   **Reversal on Broad Grounds:** The Court could adopt the petitioner's (and Justice Kavanaugh's) view that the Hobbs Act does not prevent a district court from independently interpreting the TCPA in a private damages suit.\n        *   **Reversal on Narrow Grounds:** The Court could agree with the petitioner that the FCC order is merely interpretive and lacks the force of law, thus reversing without needing to interpret the Hobbs Act's full scope.\n        *   **Affirmance/Vacatur for Respondent:** The paths I previously identified (the SG's \"finality\" argument or a merits ruling based on *Yakus*) remain plausible, but they now face a much stronger direct challenge.\n\n*   **Remaining Uncertainty:** My analysis now awaits the respondent's and the Solicitor General's merits briefs. The key question is how they will rebut the petitioner's specific textual and structural arguments, particularly the *noscitur a sociis* claim and the characterization of the Hobbs Act as a standard jurisdiction-channeling statute that is silent on preclusion in private enforcement actions.",

My belief model is currently based on the petitioner's arguments and a *projection* of the respondent's counter-arguments. This action directly replaces that projection with factual evidence, guaranteeing a significant update to my posterior beliefs about the case outcome. The Task EIG is therefore extremely high (0.95), as this action will allow me to model the complete legal dialogue presented to the Court, dramatically reducing uncertainty about the relative strengths of the competing legal frameworks. The Design EIG is also substantial (0.6). While reading the respondent's brief is a standard step, its immense value in this specific context\u2014where the petitioner has made a very strong opening argument\u2014provides crucial data for calibrating my general model. It reinforces the design principle of sequential brief analysis and provides a concrete example of how to weigh a respondent's reliance on precedent and structural arguments against a petitioner's strong textualist claims. My confidence is very high because the need for this information is explicitly stated in my current beliefs, making the value of this action clear and direct.",

The design beliefs are not explicitly detailed here, showing only a stable meta-level stance without elaborated strategic adaptations or meta-cognitive reflections, so rated moderately low (0.4). The beliefs are very coherent and well-integrated, with no contradictions and clear logical flow linking arguments, predictions, and uncertainties (0.95). The information density is very high, with detailed legal doctrines, case references, argument structures, and strategic considerations thoroughly articulated (0.9).

It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.  In 2018, McKesson \nTechnologies LLC was acquired by Change Healthcare. \nAs part of the sale agreement, McKesson Corporation \nretained responsibility for McKesson Technologies LLC\u2019s \nobligations related to this suit.  McKesson Corporation \ncurrently has no ownership or direct or indirect voting \ninterest in either Change Healthcare or McKesson \nTechnologies LLC.\n\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTION PRESENTED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi\nINTRODUCTION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\nSTATEMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\nA.

In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).  Plaintiffs may seek actual damages or \n$500 in statutory damages \u201cfor each such violation.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 227(b)(3)(B).  \n\n5\n2. \nFCC authority and judicial review\nCongress authorized the FCC to \u201cprescribe regula-\ntions to implement the requirements\u201d of the TCPA.  Id. \n\u00a7 227(b)(2).  Like other agencies, the FCC also has adju-\ndicatory authority to \u201cissue a declaratory order\u201d to \u201cter-\nminate a controversy or remove uncertainty\u201d in the laws \nit administers.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).\nThis case involves a declaratory order issued by an FCC \ncomponent on delegated authority.  Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

But unless and until \nreversed by the FCC, any \u201caction made or taken pursu-\nant to any such delegation * * * shall have the same force \nand effect, and shall be made, evidenced, and enforced in \nthe same manner, as orders, decisions, reports, or other \nactions of the Commission.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 155(c)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1.102(b)(1); 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.102(b)(3) (absent a stay from \nWKH\u0003)&&\u000f\u0003\u00c0OLQJ\u0003DQ\u0003DSSOLFDWLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003UHYLHZ\u0003GRHV\u0003QRW\u0003OLPLW\u0003WKH\u0003\neffectiveness of an action taken on delegated authority).\nA decision by the full FCC is a \u201ccondition precedent to \njudicial review\u201d of any action taken by an FCC component \non delegated authority.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).

(footnote omitted).\nActing on delegated authority, the FCC\u2019s Consumer \nand Governmental Affairs Bureau decided the petition \nafter notice and comment.  Pet. App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 48a (citing Rules & Reguls. Implementing \nthe Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, \n14133 \u00b6200 (2003)).\nThe Bureau\u2019s plain reading of the text was reinforced \nby the TCPA\u2019s purposes.

KIM\nMORRISON & FOERSTER LLP\n755 Page Mill Road\nPalo Alto, CA 94304\nCounsel for Respondents McKesson Corporation \nand McKesson Technologies, Inc.\nAUGUST 5, 2024\n\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nIn 2019, a Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) bureau issued a declaratory order clarifying \nthat online fax services, whose users essentially receive \nfaxes as email attachments, are not \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine[s]\u201d under the Telephone Consumer Protection \nAct (TCPA).  It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.  In 2018, McKesson \nTechnologies LLC was acquired by Change Healthcare. \nAs part of the sale agreement, McKesson Corporation \nretained responsibility for McKesson Technologies LLC\u2019s \nobligations related to this suit.  McKesson Corporation \ncurrently has no ownership or direct or indirect voting \ninterest in either Change Healthcare or McKesson \nTechnologies LLC.\n\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTION PRESENTED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi\nINTRODUCTION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\nSTATEMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\nA.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 48a (citing Rules & Reguls. Implementing \nthe Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, \n14133 \u00b6200 (2003)).\nThe Bureau\u2019s plain reading of the text was reinforced \nby the TCPA\u2019s purposes.

But following the FCC\u2019s 2019 decision in \nAmerifactors, respondents moved to decertify, arguing \nthat individual, fact-intensive inquiries would be needed \nto separate class members who received faxes on a stand-\nalone telephone facsimile machine from those who received \nthem via online fax services.  2-ER-197-222; 2-ER-127-151. \n7KH\u0003GLVWULFW\u0003FRXUW\u0003FRQFOXGHG\u0003WKDW\u0003GHFHUWL\u00c0FDWLRQ\u0003ZDV\u0003\npremature but split the class into a \u201cStand-Alone Fax \nMachine Class\u201d and an \u201cOnline Fax Services Class.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 24a-42a.

In so concluding, it cited authorities character-\nizing \u201cdeclaratory rulings as adjudications\u201d and explain-\ning that \u201cwhen an agency\u2019s adjudicatory decisions apply \npreexisting rules to new factual circumstances, its deter-\nminations apply retroactively.\u201d  Ibid.

Because The Decision Below Treated \nAmerifactors As An Adjudication, It Does Not \nImplicate Any Purported Post-PDR Network \nSplit About Interpretive Rules\nPetitioner contends that there is a post-PDR Network \ncircuit split \u201con whether the Hobbs Act extends even to \nFCC interpretive rules.\u201d  Pet. 14.  There is no such split, \nand, even if there were, it would not be presented here.\nAs petitioner notes, before PDR Network, the Ninth \nCircuit held that the Hobbs Act applies to interpretive \nas well as legislative rules.  U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. \nHamilton, 224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000); see Pet. 15. \nBut petitioner cites no post-PDR Network decision from \nthe Ninth Circuit or any other court of appeals so holding.\n4.\u0003 \u00037KH\u0003FRXUW\u0003RI\u0003DSSHDOV\u0003DI\u00c0UPHG\u0003WKH\u0003GLVWULFW\u0003FRXUW\u00b7V\u0003GHQLDO\u0003\nof treble damages on plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims and grant of \nsummary judgment to plaintiffs on respondents\u2019 consent defenses. \nPet. App. 9a-11a.  Neither petitioner nor respondents seek review \nof those issues.\n\n14\nThere is no such holding here.  The Ninth Circuit \ndid not characterize Amerifactors as an interpretive \nrule\u2014or any rule at all.  Instead, the court treated the \nAmerifactors order as an adjudication.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIt noted that the FCC Bureau had acted pursuant to 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).  Pet. App. 9a.  That provision authorizes \nthe Bureau to \u201cissue a declaratory ruling terminating a \ncontroversy or removing uncertainty.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a). \nThe court further observed that the APA characterizes \ndeclaratory rulings as adjudications.  Pet. App. 9a (citing \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e)); see Central Texas Tel. Co-op., Inc. v. \nFCC, 402 F.3d 205, 210 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (FCC declaratory \norder proceedings are adjudications).

App. 9a (citing Reyes v. \nGarland, 11 F.4th 985, 991 (9th Cir. 2021)). \nAdjudications and rules (whether legislative or inter-\npretive) are fundamentally different categories under \nthe APA.  See Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors, \n144 S. Ct. 2440, 2454 n.4 (2024); Bowen v. Georgetown \nUniv. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 216-225 (1988) (Scalia, J., con-\ncurring); compare 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (rulemaking) with id. \n\u00a7 554 (adjudications, including declaratory orders).

Here, as the Ninth Circuit held \n(Pet. App. 9a), the FCC proceeded through adjudication.\nPetitioner cites no post-PDR Network court of appeals \ndecision accepting a collateral attack on an FCC adjudica-\ntive ruling, much less a split on that question.  Nor could \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision here be part of any such \nsplit, given that it is non-precedential (and does not even \ncite PDR Network).  \nB. Regardless, Revisiting The Hobbs Act Question \nWould Be Premature\nAlthough PDR Network did not resolve the question \npresented there, the Court\u2014in both the majority opinion \nand Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence\u2014provided guid-\nance for lower courts about what factors may be relevant \nand how to approach the Hobbs Act question.  Given the \nrecency of that decision and the relatively small number \nof cases that present the question, the courts of appeals \nhave just begun to react to and apply that guidance.  Cer-\nWLRUDUL\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003SUHPDWXUH\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003JLYLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXUWV\u0003\nof appeals an opportunity to fully consider PDR Network.\nThe cases petitioner cites for its supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split illustrate this prematurity.  Three of those \ncases make passing references to PDR Network only \nin a footnote.  Panzarella v. Navient Sol., Inc., 37 F.4th \n867, 873 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022); Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 \nEnd, Inc., 997 F.3d 470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021); Golan v. \nFreeEats.com, Inc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019). \nIt is unsurprising that these courts did not meaningfully \nengage with the Hobbs Act question or the guidance in \n\n16\nPDR Network because the issue would not have been \noutcome-determinative in any of those cases.  All three \ncourts agreed with the FCC\u2019s interpretation, so it did not \nmatter whether they were bound by it.  See, e.g., Golan, \n930 F.3d at 960 n.8 (\u201cOur decision is not implicated by the \nrecent Supreme Court opinion in PDR Network.\u201d).  In fact, \nfar from adopting the rule petitioner claims, the Second \nCircuit expressly stated that the status of FCC orders \nremained \u201can open question\u201d and that it \u201cneed not decide \nthat question here.\u201d  Gorss Motels, 997 F.3d at 477 n.4.\nIf the Court wants to revisit PDR Network, it should \nat least wait for the courts of appeals to digest and act on \nits prior guidance, so it can reconsider the question with \nWKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003WKRVH\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003GHFLVLRQV\u0011\u0003\u0003\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 DECISION WAS \nCORRECT\nThe court of appeals correctly held that a plaintiff \nin a TCPA case cannot impose liability on a defendant \nbased on a reading of the statute the FCC has rejected \nin still-pending proceedings.

The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held Petitioner \nCould Not Collaterally Attack The FCC Bureau\u2019s \nOrder\n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the district \ncourt \u201cwas bound by the Federal Communication Commis-\nsion\u2019s Amerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined \nthat the TCPA does not apply to faxes received through \n\n17\nan online fax service.\u201d  Pet.

To \u201cdeter-\nmine the validity\u201d of an agency order is to \u201csettle a ques-\ntion or controversy about\u201d whether it is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d \nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 711 (2d ed. 1958) (determine); id. at 2813 (valid). \n7KDW\u0003EURDG\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003LQFOXGHV\u0003FROODWHUDO\u0003DWWDFNV\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003 \norder that require a court to determine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nwhen, as here, an FCC component issues an order on \ndelegated authority, the full FCC\u2019s resolution of an appli-\ncation for review of the order is a \u201ccondition precedent to \njudicial review.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).\nCongress thus laid down one exclusive path for courts \nto determine whether Amerifactors correctly interpreted \nWKH\u00037&3$\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003VWRS\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003D\u0003GHFLVLRQ\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003IXOO\u0003\nFCC on the pending application for review.  The second \nwould be review by a court of appeals on a petition for \nreview under the Hobbs Act.  A plaintiff whose claims \ndepend on a determination that the FCC\u2019s interpretation \nof the statute is wrong may not circumvent that exclusive \npath by inviting a district court to make its own deter-\nmination.\n2. In support of petitioner\u2019s position on the merits, it \nrepeatedly invokes PDR Network and Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s \nopinion concurring in the judgment.  E.g., Pet. 1, 2, 20.  But \nit fails to acknowledge that case\u2019s fundamental difference. \nThere, a TCPA defendant argued that, notwithstand-\ning the Hobbs Act, it had a right to defend itself from \nliability under an erroneous interpretation of a statute. \n\n18\nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 6.  Here, by contrast, the agency \nentrusted by Congress to interpret and enforce the TCPA \nhas said that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is correct.  It \nis the TCPA plaintiff that seeks to circumvent Hobbs Act \nreview of that determination to expand the defendants\u2019 \nliability.\n7KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003OLQH\u0003RI\u0003-XVWLFH\u0003.DYDQDXJK\u00b7V\u0003VHSDUDWH\u0003RSLQLRQ\u0003\nLGHQWL\u00c0HG\u0003WKH\u0003LVVXH\u0003KH\u0003ZDV\u0003DGGUHVVLQJ\u001d\u0003\u0003\u00b40D\\\u0003defendants in \ncivil enforcement actions under the Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act contest the Federal Communications Com-\nmission\u2019s interpretation of the Act?\u201d  Id. at 10-11 (empha-\nsis added).

Ibid.\n\n20\nIn contrast, allowing plaintiffs to challenge an agen-\ncy\u2019s interpretation that limits liability for defendants \nwould disrupt the statutory scheme.  Congress provided \nfor both FCC and private enforcement of the TCPA.  See \nMims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n374 n.4 (2012) (noting that FCC may initiate civil actions \nand impose forfeitures for violations of the statute and \nits regulations).  In such FCC enforcement actions, the \nagency would not be permitted to impose liability based \non an interpretation of the statute the agency had ex-\npressly rejected. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n567 U.S. 239, 253-254 (2012) (penalizing regulated entity \nfor non-compliance with new, more expansive interpreta-\ntion of prohibited conduct violates due process).  It makes \nsense that an enforcement action brought by a private \nindividual would be subject to the same limitation.5\nB. The TCPA Does Not Prohibit Fax Advertisements \nSent To Online Fax Services\nWhether or not Amerifactors is binding, it is correct. \nAs the Fourth Circuit recently held, the TCPA\u2019s plain \n5.  Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), \ncasts no doubt on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding.  Loper Bright \ninvolved the standard that courts apply when reviewing an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute\u2014not which court is the proper \none to conduct such review.  Loper Bright held that \u201ccourts need \nnot and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of \nthe law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d  Id. at 2273.  Should \nthe full FCC decide the Amerifactors application for review and \nshould a party challenge that decision in a court of appeals under \nthe Hobbs Act, Loper Bright will control that court\u2019s review.  This \ncase involves the different question of whether a TCPA plaintiff \ncan circumvent the Hobbs Act by effectively seeking such review \nin a district court.\n\n21\nlanguage shows that Congress did not extend the statu-\ntory prohibition to advertisements sent to online fax \nservices.

The Due Process Concerns Present In PDR \nNetwork Are Absent Here\nAs noted above, there is a fundamental differ-\nence between PDR Network and this case.  See supra \npp. 17-20.  In PDR Network, the plaintiff invoked a favor-\nable FCC order and argued the defendant could not chal-\nlenge it.  This case presents the opposite situation.  It is \nthe defendants who invoke a favorable FCC order and \nargue it is binding.\nThat difference means that the reasoning and con-\ncerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence \nin PDR Network are inapplicable here.  PDR Network \nimplicated the traditional principle that a defendant can \ntypically defend itself in an enforcement action by con-\ntending that a regulation is invalid.  To hold otherwise, \nJustice Kavanaugh wrote, would raise serious due process \nconcerns.  See supra pp. 19-20.  Petitioner points to no \ncomparable traditional principle that allows plaintiffs to \nattack an agency determination to expand the scope of \ndefendants\u2019 liability.  Limiting plaintiffs\u2019 ability to do so \nimplicates none of the due process concerns Justice Ka-\nvanaugh expressed.\n\n28\nTo answer the question that was presented in PDR \nNetwork, the Court should await a case where the plain-\ntiff invokes the Hobbs Act to prevent a defendant from \nchallenging an FCC order that the defendant contends \nexpands its liability beyond what the statute allows.\nB. The FCC Proceeding At Issue Is Ongoing \nThe FCC order here was issued by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau on delegated \nauthority.  Pet. App. 57a.  An application for review of that \norder remains pending with the full FCC.  Pet. App. 8a \nn.1.  When the FCC decides that application for review, its \ndecision will then be reviewable under the Hobbs Act in a \ncourt of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).\nThe ongoing FCC proceedings make this case differ-\nent from PDR Network, where the relevant FCC order \n(by the full Commission) had issued many years before \nthe relevant private-party litigation.  588 U.S. at 3.  The \nprovisional nature of the FCC order here poses several \nproblems for review.\n1. \nA decision by the FCC while this case \nis pending could prevent the Court from \nreaching the question presented\nBecause FCC proceedings are ongoing, the Commis-\nsion could decide the pending application for review before \nthis Court issued its decision on the merits.  And which-\never side lost before the full Commission could then seek \nHobbs Act review of that decision in a court of appeals.\n\n29\nThe outcome of those further administrative (and \npossibly judicial) proceedings could fundamentally change \nthe nature of this case and hinder this Court\u2019s ability to \nanswer the question presented.  For example, it is not \nclear what would happen if the full Commission were to \ngrant the application for review and reverse the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order.  Under those circumstances, the FCC \norder on which respondents and the court of appeals relied \nwould no longer be in force, but a new order favoring \npetitioner would be.  \nOr if a court of appeals sets aside the full FCC\u2019s order \nduring the pendency of this case in this Court, there \nwould then be no FCC order at issue.

Any of those out-\ncomes would prevent the Court from reaching the question \npresented.  This risk can be eliminated if the Court waits \nto revisit the PDR Network question in a case in which \nthe FCC order was issued by the full Commission and is \nno longer subject to judicial review.\n\n30\n2. \nStrategic decisions by petitioner and its \ncounsel in the FCC proceedings could \npreclude challenging the FCC\u2019s order, \nindependent of the Hobbs Act \nPetitioner made a strategic choice not to participate \nin the administrative proceeding whose (interim) outcome \nit now complains about.

Both those circumstances distinguish this case \nfrom PDR Network and render it an unappealing vehicle \nfor consideration of the question presented.\nIn PDR Network, the relevant FCC decision came \nseven years before the fax advertisements at issue.  588 \nU.S. at 3.

In PDR Network, \nJustice Kavanaugh noted that a party that \u201cchallenges \n6.

To be sure, petitioner here has not par-\nticipated in Ryerson.  But its counsel has\u2014not on behalf \nof some other client, but in counsel\u2019s own name.  And it did \nso for a stated representational reason:   counsel advised \nthe FCC that it \u201crepresents clients across the country in \nprivate litigation\u201d in TCPA cases and that the FCC\u2019s deci-\nsion could impact them.  Anderson + Wanca Comments, \nsupra, at 1.  And all of counsel\u2019s Ryerson\u0003\u00c0OLQJV\u0003RFFXUUHG\u0003\nconcurrently with the district court litigation here; indeed, \nFRXQVHO\u0003\u00c0OHG\u0003LWV\u0003Ryerson application for review arguing \nthat Amerifactors was wrongly decided while respondents\u2019 \nmotion to decertify the class based on Amerifactors was \npending.

Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 894 (2008) \n(quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Here, counsel \nand petitioner had a preexisting legal relationship and \ncounsel adequately represented petitioner\u2019s interests \nas to the online-fax-service issue when it participated in \nRyerson.  It is thus possible that normal preclusion prin-\nciples would bind petitioner to the result in Ryerson.  See \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring); cf. Ferris v.

There Is A Mismatch Between The Question \nPresented And The Decision Below\nPetitioner\u2019s principal argument in the district court \nand court of appeals was that Amerifactors was not binding \nunder the Hobbs Act because it was a bureau-level deci-\nsion.  Pet. CA Principal & Resp. Br. 30-33.  It limited the \nbroader argument it now makes to a footnote in its merits \nbrief and to its rehearing petition.  Pet. CA Principal & \nResp. Br. 32 n.4; Pet. CA Reh\u2019g Pet.  This would impede the \nCourt\u2019s review of the question now presented in two ways.\nFirst, as a result of how petitioner briefed the case \nbelow, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s unpublished memorandum did \nnot engage on the broader question or even cite PDR \nNetwork.  Instead, it addressed only the argument it \nunderstood petitioner to be making\u2014that the Bureau\u2019s \nRUGHU\u0003ZDV\u0003QRW\u0003D\u0003\u00b4\u00c0QDO\u0003RUGHU\u00b5\u0003IRU\u0003SXUSRVHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003+REEV\u0003\nAct.  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet petitioner does not seek review of \nthat question, so there is a mismatch between the deci-\nsion below and the question petitioner wants this Court to \nGHFLGH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003GHQLHV\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003WKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003\ndecision to review that addresses the question in light \nof PDR Network.  The Court generally does not grant \ncertiorari in that situation.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 \nU.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not \nRI\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003YLHZ\u0011\u00b5\f\u0011\n7.  Respondents had no reason to raise these complications \nbelow because petitioner did not make the argument it is pressing \nhere, and no decision has yet triggered preclusion.  See infra Part \nIII.C.\n\n34\nSecond, petitioner nowhere disclaims the argument it \nmade to the court of appeals.  If petitioner\u2019s merits brief \nwere to revive that argument involving the bureau-level \nnature of the FCC order, the case could end up focused on \nthat idiosyncrasy.  Again, this possibility for distraction \nmakes this a poor vehicle for review.\n'\u0011\u0003 $Q\u0003$OWHUQDWLYH\u0003*URXQG\u0003)RU\u0003$I\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003%DVHG\u0003\nOn The Plain Statutory Text Makes This A \nPoor Vehicle\n$Q\u0003REYLRXV\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u00b3WKH\u0003\nFCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute is plainly correct as a \nde novo matter\u2014could prevent the Court from deciding \nthe question presented.  \nAs discussed above, respondents have argued all \nalong that the statute plainly does not cover online fax \nservices, and they would make that argument again as \nDQ\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003LI\u0003FHUWLRUDUL\u0003ZHUH\u0003\ngranted.

Petitioner argued below that the Sixth Circuit in Lyngaas \nv. Ag, 992 F.3d 412 (2021), supports its statutory argument that \nthe TCPA applies to online fax services.  But as the Fourth Circuit \nhas explained, that is incorrect.

The district \ncourt there found Amerifactors binding under the Hobbs \nAct.  See Career Counseling, Inc. v. Amerifactors Finan-\ncial Group, LLC, No. 3:16-cv-03013, 2021 WL 3022677, \nat *8-*10 (D.S.C. July 16, 2021).  On appeal, the plaintiff \n\u201cargue[d] that the district court committed legal error \nin according Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC Ruling that an online fax service does not qualify as \na \u2018telephone facsimile machine\u2019 under the TCPA.\u201d  Career \nCounseling, 91 F.4th at 208.  \nBut the Fourth Circuit concluded that it \u201cneed not \nassess or determine whether the district court erred in \naccording Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC ruling.\u201d  Id. at 209.  That was so because it was \n\u00b4VDWLV\u00c0HG\u0003WR\u0003UXOH\u00b3GH\u0003QRYR\u00b3WKDW\u0003SXUVXDQW\u0003WR\u0003LWV\u0003SODLQ\u0003\nstatutory language, the TCPA prohibits the sending of \nunsolicited advertisements to what the district court \nlabelled as \u2018stand-alone fax machines,\u2019 but not to what the \ncourt accepted to be \u2018online fax services.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  That \nsame path of least resistance is present here.  \nAnd were this Court to disregard the statutory ques-\ntion and reverse the Ninth Circuit on the Hobbs Act, \nthat court on remand would then likely come to the same \nconclusion based on the plain statutory text.  If the Court \nwants to address the Hobbs Act question, it should await \na case where it might matter to the ultimate outcome.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nRespectfully submittted,\nDEANNE E.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal reasoning step, a summary of the analysis that led to my current belief state. It does not introduce new substantive information or evidence about the case but rather confirms the significant shift in my understanding after processing the petitioner's merits brief. Therefore, my prior beliefs remain stable and have been reinforced by this reflective step.\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow (Reinforced):** My understanding of the case as a direct follow-up to the unresolved questions in ***PDR Network*** is unchanged. The petitioner's brief has successfully framed the debate around the limits of the Hobbs Act's preclusive effect in private damages actions, directly engaging with Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence. This strategic framing remains a central feature of the case.\n\n*   **Stable Competing Arguments (Petitioner vs. Respondent/SG):** The core legal arguments are now clearly delineated in my belief model, awaiting the respondent's rebuttal.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Established):**\n        1.  **Primary Argument:** The Hobbs Act's jurisdictional bar on \"determin[ing] the validity of\" an agency order does not apply to district courts interpreting a statute in a private damages action. This is based on a textual reading (*noscitur a sociis*) and a structural understanding of the Act as a jurisdiction-channeling statute for direct, pre-enforcement review.\n        2.  **Fallback Argument:** The specific FCC order is an \"interpretive rule\" that lacks the force of law and therefore cannot be binding on a court, irrespective of the Hobbs Act.\n    *   **Respondent/SG's Anticipated Position (Awaiting Confirmation):** Their case will likely rely on the broad preclusive language of the Hobbs Act, precedent like ***Yakus v. United States***, and the argument that allowing district courts to disregard the FCC's order constitutes an impermissible \"collateral attack.\"\n\n*   **Stable Assessment of \"Off-Ramps\":** The existence of multiple paths to a narrow decision remains a key factor influencing my prediction. The Court could avoid a sweeping ruling on the Hobbs Act by focusing on either:\n    *   **Petitioner's Off-Ramp:** The interpretive nature of the FCC rule.\n    *   **SG's Potential Off-Ramp:** The finality of the FCC order at the time it was issued.\n    The presence of these options makes a narrow, case-specific reversal a highly plausible outcome.\n\n*   **Stable Prediction & Confidence (Awaiting Rebuttal):** My confidence in a victory for the respondent (McKesson) remains significantly diminished. The case is now viewed as highly competitive. The petitioner has presented a robust and textually grounded argument that creates a clear path to victory. The plausible outcomes remain:\n    1.  **Reversal on Broad Grounds:** Adopting the petitioner's view that the Hobbs Act does not preclude independent statutory interpretation in private damages suits.\n    2.  **Reversal on Narrow Grounds:** Ruling that the FCC order is non-binding because it is merely interpretive.\n    3.  **Affirmance for Respondent:** Accepting the \"collateral attack\" theory and the broad preclusive effect of the Hobbs Act.\n\n*   **Remaining Uncertainty (Unchanged):** This observation confirms that the most critical information gap is the respondent's merits brief. My analysis is poised to evaluate how McKesson and the Solicitor General will directly address the petitioner's textual (*noscitur a sociis*) and structural arguments. Their response will be the next major catalyst for updating my beliefs and refining my prediction.",

This is not the merits brief I was seeking, but it is still highly valuable as it outlines their core arguments for why the Court should not have taken the case, and these arguments will likely form the basis of their merits strategy. I need to synthesize this new information. \n\nKey arguments from McKesson's BIO:\n1.  **Poor Vehicle/Procedural Bars:** McKesson argues this case is a poor vehicle to decide the *PDR Network* question. They distinguish it by noting the petitioner is a *plaintiff* trying to create liability via collateral attack, unlike the *defendant* in *PDR Network* who was defending against liability. This framing is designed to neutralize the due process concerns raised by Justice Kavanaugh. They also point to ongoing FCC review of the underlying order and argue petitioner's counsel is precluded from challenging the order due to forgoing participation in the agency proceedings.\n2.  **Adjudication vs. Interpretive Rule:** McKesson directly counters the petitioner's fallback argument by classifying the FCC order as an adjudication, not an interpretive rule. If the Court accepts this, the entire line of argument about the non-binding nature of interpretive rules becomes irrelevant.\n3.  **Statutory Off-Ramp:** Most importantly, McKesson offers the Court a clear 'off-ramp'. They argue the Court can and should affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision on the alternative ground that the plain text of the TCPA does not apply to online fax services. This would allow the Court to resolve the case in McKesson's favor without ever reaching the complex Hobbs Act question.\n\nMy belief state has been significantly updated. The existence of these plausible off-ramps, especially the statutory one, increases the probability of an affirmance for McKesson without a broad ruling on the Hobbs Act. The central conflict is no longer just about the Hobbs Act's scope, but also about whether the Court should even reach that question.\n\nMy next step must be to find the respondent's actual merits brief. The BIO is a powerful preview, but the merits brief will show how they refine these arguments in response to the petitioner's merits brief and which arguments they choose to emphasize. This remains the most critical piece of missing information.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the respondent's (McKesson's) Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for a writ of certiorari. Although this document precedes the Court's decision to grant review and is not the final merits brief, it provides the first direct evidence of the respondent's legal strategy and arguments. It substantially refines my understanding of the competing legal theories and the potential paths the Court might take.\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow (Refined):** The case remains a direct descendant of the questions left open in ***PDR Network***. However, the BIO reveals McKesson's primary strategy is not to meet the petitioner's argument head-on, but to reframe the case as a poor vehicle that is factually and procedurally distinct from *PDR Network*. McKesson emphasizes that here, a *plaintiff* (McLaughlin) seeks to collaterally attack an agency order to *create* liability, whereas in *PDR Network*, a *defendant* sought to attack an order to *defend* against liability. McKesson argues this distinction removes the due process concerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence, weakening the petitioner's core framing.\n\n*   **Competing Arguments (Now Concrete):** My model of the competing arguments is no longer based on anticipation. The BIO has populated the respondent's side of the ledger with specific claims.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):**\n        1.  **Primary Argument:** The Hobbs Act's preclusive effect does not apply to district courts interpreting a statute in a private damages action.\n        2.  **Fallback Argument:** The FCC order is a non-binding \"interpretive rule.\"\n    *   **Respondent's Position (Established from BIO):**\n        1.  **Primary Argument (Procedural/Vehicular):** This case is a poor vehicle. The plaintiff-challenger posture distinguishes it from *PDR Network*; the underlying FCC order (*Amerifactors*) is still undergoing internal agency review, creating finality problems; and the petitioner is procedurally barred from a collateral attack because its counsel had the opportunity to participate in the FCC proceeding and seek direct review but strategically chose not to.\n        2.  **Rebuttal to Petitioner's Fallback:** The FCC order is an *adjudication*, not an interpretive rule, making arguments about the preclusive effect of interpretive rules irrelevant.\n        3.  **Alternative Merits Ground:** The Court should avoid the Hobbs Act question entirely and affirm on the plain text of the TCPA. McKesson argues the TCPA unambiguously does not apply to online fax services because they lack the capacity \"to transcribe text or images...onto paper\" (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).\n\n*   **Assessment of \"Off-Ramps\" (Significantly Updated):** The BIO clarifies and expands the potential \"off-ramps\" for a narrow decision.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Interpretive Rule\" Off-Ramp:** This path is now directly contested by McKesson, which characterizes the FCC order as an adjudication. This creates a threshold dispute over the nature of the agency action itself.\n    *   **Respondent's \"Statutory Interpretation\" Off-Ramp:** McKesson is heavily promoting an alternative path to affirmance: rule that the TCPA's text simply doesn't cover the conduct, regardless of what the FCC said. This is a powerful argument for judicial minimalism, as it would resolve the case for the respondent without requiring the Court to issue a broad ruling on the Hobbs Act.\n    *   **New Procedural Off-Ramps:** McKesson has introduced two new potential exits for the Court: ruling that the case is not ripe or is a poor vehicle because the underlying FCC order is not yet final within the agency, or ruling that the petitioner is precluded from challenging the order due to its failure to participate in the available administrative review process.\n\n*   **Prediction & Confidence (Adjusted):** The case remains highly competitive, but the numerous and plausible off-ramps offered by McKesson slightly increase the probability of an affirmance. The petitioner's success now depends not only on the strength of its Hobbs Act argument but also on its ability to persuade the Court to bypass these multiple, potentially dispositive, alternative grounds. The pathways to a victory for McKesson are now clearer and more varied. The plausible outcomes are:\n    1.  **Reversal on Broad Grounds:** Adopting the petitioner's view on the Hobbs Act. (Slightly less likely now, given the attractive off-ramps).\n    2.  **Reversal on Narrow Grounds:** Ruling the FCC order is a non-binding interpretive rule. (Contested by respondent).\n    3.  **Affirmance on Hobbs Act Grounds:** Accepting the \"collateral attack\" theory.\n    4.  **Affirmance on Alternative Statutory Grounds:** Ruling the TCPA's plain text does not cover the conduct, and declining to reach the Hobbs Act question. (Probability of this outcome has increased significantly).\n    5.  **Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) or Vacatur:** Dismissing the case due to the vehicular/procedural problems raised by McKesson (e.g., ongoing agency review). (A newly identified, plausible outcome).\n\n*   **Remaining Uncertainty (Refined):** The most critical missing information remains the respondent's *merits* brief and the brief from the Solicitor General. However, the uncertainty has shifted. I am no longer uncertain *what* McKesson will argue, but rather *how effectively* they will develop these arguments in their merits brief and how they will specifically rebut the petitioner's detailed textual analysis of the Hobbs Act. The SG's position on the various off-ramps will be particularly informative.",

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet.

KIM\nMORRISON & FOERSTER LLP\n755 Page Mill Road\nPalo Alto, CA 94304\nCounsel for Respondents McKesson Corporation \nand McKesson Technologies, Inc.\nAUGUST 5, 2024\n\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nIn 2019, a Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) bureau issued a declaratory order clarifying \nthat online fax services, whose users essentially receive \nfaxes as email attachments, are not \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine[s]\u201d under the Telephone Consumer Protection \nAct (TCPA).  It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.  In 2018, McKesson \nTechnologies LLC was acquired by Change Healthcare. \nAs part of the sale agreement, McKesson Corporation \nretained responsibility for McKesson Technologies LLC\u2019s \nobligations related to this suit.  McKesson Corporation \ncurrently has no ownership or direct or indirect voting \ninterest in either Change Healthcare or McKesson \nTechnologies LLC.\n\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTION PRESENTED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi\nINTRODUCTION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\nSTATEMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\nA.

Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.

First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet.

There is no such split, \nand, even if there were, it would not be presented here.\nAs petitioner notes, before PDR Network, the Ninth \nCircuit held that the Hobbs Act applies to interpretive \nas well as legislative rules.

The Ninth Circuit \ndid not characterize Amerifactors as an interpretive \nrule\u2014or any rule at all.  Instead, the court treated the \nAmerifactors order as an adjudication.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIt noted that the FCC Bureau had acted pursuant to 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).  Pet. App. 9a.  That provision authorizes \nthe Bureau to \u201cissue a declaratory ruling terminating a \ncontroversy or removing uncertainty.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a). \nThe court further observed that the APA characterizes \ndeclaratory rulings as adjudications.  Pet. App. 9a (citing \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e)); see Central Texas Tel. Co-op., Inc. v. \nFCC, 402 F.3d 205, 210 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (FCC declaratory \norder proceedings are adjudications).

App. 9a (citing Reyes v. \nGarland, 11 F.4th 985, 991 (9th Cir. 2021)). \nAdjudications and rules (whether legislative or inter-\npretive) are fundamentally different categories under \nthe APA.  See Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors, \n144 S. Ct. 2440, 2454 n.4 (2024); Bowen v. Georgetown \nUniv.

Here, as the Ninth Circuit held \n(Pet. App. 9a), the FCC proceeded through adjudication.\nPetitioner cites no post-PDR Network court of appeals \ndecision accepting a collateral attack on an FCC adjudica-\ntive ruling, much less a split on that question.  Nor could \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision here be part of any such \nsplit, given that it is non-precedential (and does not even \ncite PDR Network).  \nB. Regardless, Revisiting The Hobbs Act Question \nWould Be Premature\nAlthough PDR Network did not resolve the question \npresented there, the Court\u2014in both the majority opinion \nand Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence\u2014provided guid-\nance for lower courts about what factors may be relevant \nand how to approach the Hobbs Act question.  Given the \nrecency of that decision and the relatively small number \nof cases that present the question, the courts of appeals \nhave just begun to react to and apply that guidance.  Cer-\nWLRUDUL\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003SUHPDWXUH\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003JLYLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXUWV\u0003\nof appeals an opportunity to fully consider PDR Network.\nThe cases petitioner cites for its supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split illustrate this prematurity.  Three of those \ncases make passing references to PDR Network only \nin a footnote.  Panzarella v. Navient Sol., Inc., 37 F.4th \n867, 873 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022); Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 \nEnd, Inc., 997 F.3d 470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021); Golan v. \nFreeEats.com, Inc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019). \nIt is unsurprising that these courts did not meaningfully \nengage with the Hobbs Act question or the guidance in \n\n16\nPDR Network because the issue would not have been \noutcome-determinative in any of those cases.  All three \ncourts agreed with the FCC\u2019s interpretation, so it did not \nmatter whether they were bound by it.  See, e.g., Golan, \n930 F.3d at 960 n.8 (\u201cOur decision is not implicated by the \nrecent Supreme Court opinion in PDR Network.\u201d).  In fact, \nfar from adopting the rule petitioner claims, the Second \nCircuit expressly stated that the status of FCC orders \nremained \u201can open question\u201d and that it \u201cneed not decide \nthat question here.\u201d  Gorss Motels, 997 F.3d at 477 n.4.\nIf the Court wants to revisit PDR Network, it should \nat least wait for the courts of appeals to digest and act on \nits prior guidance, so it can reconsider the question with \nWKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003WKRVH\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003GHFLVLRQV\u0011\u0003\u0003\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 DECISION WAS \nCORRECT\nThe court of appeals correctly held that a plaintiff \nin a TCPA case cannot impose liability on a defendant \nbased on a reading of the statute the FCC has rejected \nin still-pending proceedings.  And, regardless, the FCC\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute is correct, providing a \nVWUDLJKWIRUZDUG\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0011\nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held Petitioner \nCould Not Collaterally Attack The FCC Bureau\u2019s \nOrder\n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the district \ncourt \u201cwas bound by the Federal Communication Commis-\nsion\u2019s Amerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined \nthat the TCPA does not apply to faxes received through \n\n17\nan online fax service.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  The Hobbs Act gives \ncourts of appeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine \nWKH\u0003YDOLGLW\\\u0003RI\u00b5\u0003FHUWDLQ\u0003\u00c0QDO\u0003RUGHUV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003)&&\u0011\u0003\u0003\u0015\u001b\u00038\u00116\u0011&\u0011\u0003\n\u00a7 2342 (emphasis added); see 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).  To \u201cdeter-\nmine the validity\u201d of an agency order is to \u201csettle a ques-\ntion or controversy about\u201d whether it is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d \nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 711 (2d ed. 1958) (determine); id. at 2813 (valid). \n7KDW\u0003EURDG\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003LQFOXGHV\u0003FROODWHUDO\u0003DWWDFNV\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003 \norder that require a court to determine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nwhen, as here, an FCC component issues an order on \ndelegated authority, the full FCC\u2019s resolution of an appli-\ncation for review of the order is a \u201ccondition precedent to \njudicial review.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).\nCongress thus laid down one exclusive path for courts \nto determine whether Amerifactors correctly interpreted \nWKH\u00037&3$\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003VWRS\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003D\u0003GHFLVLRQ\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003IXOO\u0003\nFCC on the pending application for review.  The second \nwould be review by a court of appeals on a petition for \nreview under the Hobbs Act.  A plaintiff whose claims \ndepend on a determination that the FCC\u2019s interpretation \nof the statute is wrong may not circumvent that exclusive \npath by inviting a district court to make its own deter-\nmination.\n2. In support of petitioner\u2019s position on the merits, it \nrepeatedly invokes PDR Network and Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s \nopinion concurring in the judgment.  E.g., Pet. 1, 2, 20.  But \nit fails to acknowledge that case\u2019s fundamental difference. \nThere, a TCPA defendant argued that, notwithstand-\ning the Hobbs Act, it had a right to defend itself from \nliability under an erroneous interpretation of a statute. \n\n18\nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 6.  Here, by contrast, the agency \nentrusted by Congress to interpret and enforce the TCPA \nhas said that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is correct.  It \nis the TCPA plaintiff that seeks to circumvent Hobbs Act \nreview of that determination to expand the defendants\u2019 \nliability.\n7KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003OLQH\u0003RI\u0003-XVWLFH\u0003.DYDQDXJK\u00b7V\u0003VHSDUDWH\u0003RSLQLRQ\u0003\nLGHQWL\u00c0HG\u0003WKH\u0003LVVXH\u0003KH\u0003ZDV\u0003DGGUHVVLQJ\u001d\u0003\u0003\u00b40D\\\u0003defendants in \ncivil enforcement actions under the Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act contest the Federal Communications Com-\nmission\u2019s interpretation of the Act?\u201d  Id. at 10-11 (empha-\nsis added).  And his opinion repeatedly emphasized the \ndefendant-centered question before the Court.  See, e.g., \nid. at 12 (\u201cI would conclude that the Hobbs Act does not \nbar a defendant in an enforcement action from arguing \nthat the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d); \nid. at 12 (\u201cThe general rule of administrative law is that \nin an enforcement action, a defendant may argue that \nan agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong, at least \nunless Congress has expressly precluded the defendant \nfrom advancing such an argument.\u201d); id. at 14 (\u201cThe ques-\ntion for us is whether the Hobbs Act bars defendants in \nthose enforcement actions from arguing that the agency \nincorrectly interpreted the statute.

That background principle formed the \nbasis of the \u201cdefault rule\u201d that he applied to statutes he \ncategorized as \u201csilent about review in subsequent enforce-\nment actions\u201d:  \u201cIn those enforcement actions, the defen-\ndant may argue that the agency\u2019s interpretation is wrong.\u201d \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 15.  But neither he nor the PDR \nNetwork majority cited any such principle under which a \nplaintiff in such an enforcement action may do the same. \nJustice Kavanaugh\u2019s emphasis on defendants\u2019 rights \nalso implicated a \u201cconstitutional issue\u201d:  \u201cBarring defen-\ndants in as-applied enforcement actions from raising \narguments about the reach and authority of agency rules \nHQIRUFHG\u0003DJDLQVW\u0003WKHP\u0003UDLVHV\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHVWLRQV\u0003XQGHU\u0003\nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.  He explained that this \nconstitutional concern counseled in favor of \u201cthe default \nrule\u201d allowing defendants to make such arguments.  Ibid.\n\n20\nIn contrast, allowing plaintiffs to challenge an agen-\ncy\u2019s interpretation that limits liability for defendants \nwould disrupt the statutory scheme.  Congress provided \nfor both FCC and private enforcement of the TCPA.  See \nMims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n374 n.4 (2012) (noting that FCC may initiate civil actions \nand impose forfeitures for violations of the statute and \nits regulations).  In such FCC enforcement actions, the \nagency would not be permitted to impose liability based \non an interpretation of the statute the agency had ex-\npressly rejected. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n567 U.S. 239, 253-254 (2012) (penalizing regulated entity \nfor non-compliance with new, more expansive interpreta-\ntion of prohibited conduct violates due process).  It makes \nsense that an enforcement action brought by a private \nindividual would be subject to the same limitation.5\nB. The TCPA Does Not Prohibit Fax Advertisements \nSent To Online Fax Services\nWhether or not Amerifactors is binding, it is correct. \nAs the Fourth Circuit recently held, the TCPA\u2019s plain \n5.  Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), \ncasts no doubt on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding.  Loper Bright \ninvolved the standard that courts apply when reviewing an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute\u2014not which court is the proper \none to conduct such review.  Loper Bright held that \u201ccourts need \nnot and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of \nthe law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d  Id. at 2273.  Should \nthe full FCC decide the Amerifactors application for review and \nshould a party challenge that decision in a court of appeals under \nthe Hobbs Act, Loper Bright will control that court\u2019s review.  This \ncase involves the different question of whether a TCPA plaintiff \ncan circumvent the Hobbs Act by effectively seeking such review \nin a district court.\n\n21\nlanguage shows that Congress did not extend the statu-\ntory prohibition to advertisements sent to online fax \nservices.

THIS CASE IS A POOR VEHICLE FOR \nRESOLVING THE QUESTION PRESENTED\nPetitioner pitches this case as the \u201cideal vehicle to \nresolve the question presented, but left undecided, in \nPDR Network.\u201d  Pet. 2.  But this case is different from \nPDR Network for multiple reasons, and each one poses a \nVLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003SUREOHP\u0011\u0003\u0003,I\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003ZDQWV\u0003WR\u0003UHYLVLW\u0003\nthe question presented in PDR Network, it should wait \nfor another case to do so. \nA. The Due Process Concerns Present In PDR \nNetwork Are Absent Here\nAs noted above, there is a fundamental differ-\nence between PDR Network and this case.  See supra \npp. 17-20.  In PDR Network, the plaintiff invoked a favor-\nable FCC order and argued the defendant could not chal-\nlenge it.  This case presents the opposite situation.  It is \nthe defendants who invoke a favorable FCC order and \nargue it is binding.\nThat difference means that the reasoning and con-\ncerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence \nin PDR Network are inapplicable here.  PDR Network \nimplicated the traditional principle that a defendant can \ntypically defend itself in an enforcement action by con-\ntending that a regulation is invalid.  To hold otherwise, \nJustice Kavanaugh wrote, would raise serious due process \nconcerns.  See supra pp. 19-20.  Petitioner points to no \ncomparable traditional principle that allows plaintiffs to \nattack an agency determination to expand the scope of \ndefendants\u2019 liability.  Limiting plaintiffs\u2019 ability to do so \nimplicates none of the due process concerns Justice Ka-\nvanaugh expressed.\n\n28\nTo answer the question that was presented in PDR \nNetwork, the Court should await a case where the plain-\ntiff invokes the Hobbs Act to prevent a defendant from \nchallenging an FCC order that the defendant contends \nexpands its liability beyond what the statute allows.\nB. The FCC Proceeding At Issue Is Ongoing \nThe FCC order here was issued by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau on delegated \nauthority.  Pet. App. 57a.  An application for review of that \norder remains pending with the full FCC.  Pet. App. 8a \nn.1.  When the FCC decides that application for review, its \ndecision will then be reviewable under the Hobbs Act in a \ncourt of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).\nThe ongoing FCC proceedings make this case differ-\nent from PDR Network, where the relevant FCC order \n(by the full Commission) had issued many years before \nthe relevant private-party litigation.  588 U.S. at 3.  The \nprovisional nature of the FCC order here poses several \nproblems for review.\n1. \nA decision by the FCC while this case \nis pending could prevent the Court from \nreaching the question presented\nBecause FCC proceedings are ongoing, the Commis-\nsion could decide the pending application for review before \nthis Court issued its decision on the merits.  And which-\never side lost before the full Commission could then seek \nHobbs Act review of that decision in a court of appeals.\n\n29\nThe outcome of those further administrative (and \npossibly judicial) proceedings could fundamentally change \nthe nature of this case and hinder this Court\u2019s ability to \nanswer the question presented.  For example, it is not \nclear what would happen if the full Commission were to \ngrant the application for review and reverse the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order.  Under those circumstances, the FCC \norder on which respondents and the court of appeals relied \nwould no longer be in force, but a new order favoring \npetitioner would be.  \nOr if a court of appeals sets aside the full FCC\u2019s order \nduring the pendency of this case in this Court, there \nwould then be no FCC order at issue.  And a different \nquestion\u2014decided by the Ninth Circuit in an appeal ear-\nlier in this case\u2014could be presented:  is the decision of a \nHobbs Act court setting aside an FCC order binding on \nanother court deciding a dispute between private parties? \nSee True Health Chiropractic, 896 F.3d at 930 (answering \nyes); accord Gorss Motels, Inc. v. FCC, 20 F.4th 87, 96 (2d \nCir. 2021); Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. ASD Specialty \nHealthcare, Inc., 863 F.3d 460, 467-468 (6th Cir. 2017).\nThese and other scenarios made possible by Ameri-\nfactors\u2019 pendency greatly increase the risk of a dismissal \nRI\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003LPSURYLGHQWO\\\u0003JUDQWHG\u000f\u0003D\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003RI\u0003\nmootness, or a remand to the Ninth Circuit based solely \non Amerifactors-related developments.  Any of those out-\ncomes would prevent the Court from reaching the question \npresented.  This risk can be eliminated if the Court waits \nto revisit the PDR Network question in a case in which \nthe FCC order was issued by the full Commission and is \nno longer subject to judicial review.\n\n30\n2. \nStrategic decisions by petitioner and its \ncounsel in the FCC proceedings could \npreclude challenging the FCC\u2019s order, \nindependent of the Hobbs Act \nPetitioner made a strategic choice not to participate \nin the administrative proceeding whose (interim) outcome \nit now complains about.  But its attorneys in their own \nnames are participating in a related FCC proceeding pre-\nsenting the same question.  See supra pp. 8-9 (discussing \nRyerson).  Both those circumstances distinguish this case \nfrom PDR Network and render it an unappealing vehicle \nfor consideration of the question presented.\nIn PDR Network, the relevant FCC decision came \nseven years before the fax advertisements at issue.  588 \nU.S. at 3.  This Court noted that the APA \u201cprovides that \n\u2018agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement\u2019 except \u2018to \nthe extent that [a] prior, adequate, and exclusive oppor-\ntunity for judicial review is provided by law.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 7 \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703) (emphasis by Court).

In PDR Network, \nJustice Kavanaugh noted that a party that \u201cchallenges \n6.

To be sure, petitioner here has not par-\nticipated in Ryerson.  But its counsel has\u2014not on behalf \nof some other client, but in counsel\u2019s own name.  And it did \nso for a stated representational reason:   counsel advised \nthe FCC that it \u201crepresents clients across the country in \nprivate litigation\u201d in TCPA cases and that the FCC\u2019s deci-\nsion could impact them.  Anderson + Wanca Comments, \nsupra, at 1.  And all of counsel\u2019s Ryerson\u0003\u00c0OLQJV\u0003RFFXUUHG\u0003\nconcurrently with the district court litigation here; indeed, \nFRXQVHO\u0003\u00c0OHG\u0003LWV\u0003Ryerson application for review arguing \nthat Amerifactors was wrongly decided while respondents\u2019 \nmotion to decertify the class based on Amerifactors was \npending.  See supra pp. 8-9.\nA prior decision can be the basis for issue preclusion \neven as to non-parties in a variety of circumstances, \nincluding when there is a \u201cpre-existing substantive legal \nrelationship between the person to be bound and a party \nto the judgment\u201d and where the nonparty was \u201cadequately \nrepresented by someone with the same interests who \nwas a party.\u201d  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 894 (2008) \n(quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Here, counsel \nand petitioner had a preexisting legal relationship and \ncounsel adequately represented petitioner\u2019s interests \nas to the online-fax-service issue when it participated in \nRyerson.  It is thus possible that normal preclusion prin-\nciples would bind petitioner to the result in Ryerson.  See \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring); cf. Ferris v. Cuevas, 118 F.3d 122, 127, 130 (2d Cir. \n\u0014\u001c\u001c\u001a\f\u0003\u000bDSSO\\LQJ\u00031HZ\u0003<RUN\u0003ODZ\u0003DQG\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003UHV\u0003MXGLFDWD\u0003EDU\u0003\nbecause, among other reasons, attorneys in second case \nKDG\u0003DSSHDUHG\u0003LQ\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003FDVH\u0003LQ\u0003WKHLU\u0003RZQ\u0003QDPHV\f\u0011\n\n33\nAt the very least, both of these issues would likely \ncomplicate the Court\u2019s review of the Hobbs Act question.7\nC. There Is A Mismatch Between The Question \nPresented And The Decision Below\nPetitioner\u2019s principal argument in the district court \nand court of appeals was that Amerifactors was not binding \nunder the Hobbs Act because it was a bureau-level deci-\nsion.  Pet. CA Principal & Resp. Br. 30-33.  It limited the \nbroader argument it now makes to a footnote in its merits \nbrief and to its rehearing petition.  Pet. CA Principal & \nResp. Br. 32 n.4; Pet. CA Reh\u2019g Pet.  This would impede the \nCourt\u2019s review of the question now presented in two ways.\nFirst, as a result of how petitioner briefed the case \nbelow, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s unpublished memorandum did \nnot engage on the broader question or even cite PDR \nNetwork.  Instead, it addressed only the argument it \nunderstood petitioner to be making\u2014that the Bureau\u2019s \nRUGHU\u0003ZDV\u0003QRW\u0003D\u0003\u00b4\u00c0QDO\u0003RUGHU\u00b5\u0003IRU\u0003SXUSRVHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003+REEV\u0003\nAct.  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet petitioner does not seek review of \nthat question, so there is a mismatch between the deci-\nsion below and the question petitioner wants this Court to \nGHFLGH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003GHQLHV\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003WKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003\ndecision to review that addresses the question in light \nof PDR Network.  The Court generally does not grant \ncertiorari in that situation.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 \nU.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not \nRI\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003YLHZ\u0011\u00b5\f\u0011\n7.  Respondents had no reason to raise these complications \nbelow because petitioner did not make the argument it is pressing \nhere, and no decision has yet triggered preclusion.  See infra Part \nIII.C.\n\n34\nSecond, petitioner nowhere disclaims the argument it \nmade to the court of appeals.  If petitioner\u2019s merits brief \nwere to revive that argument involving the bureau-level \nnature of the FCC order, the case could end up focused on \nthat idiosyncrasy.  Again, this possibility for distraction \nmakes this a poor vehicle for review.\n'\u0011\u0003 $Q\u0003$OWHUQDWLYH\u0003*URXQG\u0003)RU\u0003$I\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003%DVHG\u0003\nOn The Plain Statutory Text Makes This A \nPoor Vehicle\n$Q\u0003REYLRXV\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u00b3WKH\u0003\nFCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute is plainly correct as a \nde novo matter\u2014could prevent the Court from deciding \nthe question presented.  \nAs discussed above, respondents have argued all \nalong that the statute plainly does not cover online fax \nservices, and they would make that argument again as \nDQ\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003LI\u0003FHUWLRUDUL\u0003ZHUH\u0003\ngranted.

Petitioner argued below that the Sixth Circuit in Lyngaas \nv. Ag, 992 F.3d 412 (2021), supports its statutory argument that \nthe TCPA applies to online fax services.  But as the Fourth Circuit \nhas explained, that is incorrect.

The district \ncourt there found Amerifactors binding under the Hobbs \nAct.  See Career Counseling, Inc. v. Amerifactors Finan-\ncial Group, LLC, No. 3:16-cv-03013, 2021 WL 3022677, \nat *8-*10 (D.S.C. July 16, 2021).  On appeal, the plaintiff \n\u201cargue[d] that the district court committed legal error \nin according Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC Ruling that an online fax service does not qualify as \na \u2018telephone facsimile machine\u2019 under the TCPA.\u201d  Career \nCounseling, 91 F.4th at 208.  \nBut the Fourth Circuit concluded that it \u201cneed not \nassess or determine whether the district court erred in \naccording Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC ruling.\u201d  Id. at 209.  That was so because it was \n\u00b4VDWLV\u00c0HG\u0003WR\u0003UXOH\u00b3GH\u0003QRYR\u00b3WKDW\u0003SXUVXDQW\u0003WR\u0003LWV\u0003SODLQ\u0003\nstatutory language, the TCPA prohibits the sending of \nunsolicited advertisements to what the district court \nlabelled as \u2018stand-alone fax machines,\u2019 but not to what the \ncourt accepted to be \u2018online fax services.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  That \nsame path of least resistance is present here.  \nAnd were this Court to disregard the statutory ques-\ntion and reverse the Ninth Circuit on the Hobbs Act, \nthat court on remand would then likely come to the same \nconclusion based on the plain statutory text.  If the Court \nwants to address the Hobbs Act question, it should await \na case where it might matter to the ultimate outcome.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nRespectfully submittted,\nDEANNE E.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an analysis of the respondent's (McKesson's) Brief in Opposition (BIO). This brief, while filed before the Court granted review, is the first direct evidence of the respondent's legal strategy. It significantly refines my understanding of the case by revealing the specific arguments McKesson will likely deploy on the merits, particularly their focus on procedural and alternative grounds for affirmance.\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow (Refined):** The case remains centered on the Hobbs Act question left unresolved in ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.*** However, the BIO reveals McKesson's primary strategy is not a direct confrontation on the Hobbs Act's meaning. Instead, they aim to reframe the case as a \"poor vehicle\" that is factually and procedurally distinct. McKesson highlights that here, a *plaintiff* (McLaughlin) is collaterally attacking an agency order to *create* liability, whereas in *PDR Network*, a *defendant* attacked an order to *defend* against liability. This distinction is a strategic attempt to neutralize the due process concerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network*, thereby weakening the petitioner's central framing of the issue.\n\n*   **Competing Arguments (Now Concrete):** My model of the competing arguments is no longer based on anticipation; the BIO has populated the respondent's side with specific claims.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):**\n        1.  **Primary Argument:** The Hobbs Act's exclusive jurisdiction provision for challenging agency orders does not apply to federal district courts when they are interpreting a statute in the context of a private damages action.\n        2.  **Fallback Argument:** The specific FCC order at issue is a non-binding \"interpretive rule,\" not a legislative rule, and therefore does not command deference or preclusive effect.\n    *   **Respondent's Position (Established from BIO):**\n        1.  **Primary Argument (Procedural/Vehicular):** This case is a poor vehicle for resolving the question presented. McKesson advances three reasons: (a) The plaintiff-challenger posture distinguishes it from *PDR Network*; (b) The underlying FCC order (*Amerifactors*) is still undergoing agency review, raising finality and ripeness issues; and (c) The petitioner is procedurally barred from this collateral attack because its counsel had the opportunity to seek direct review of the FCC order but strategically chose not to.\n        2.  **Rebuttal to Petitioner's Fallback:** The FCC order is an *adjudication*, not an interpretive rule. This characterization, if accepted, would render the petitioner's fallback argument irrelevant.\n        3.  **Alternative Merits Ground:** The Court should avoid the Hobbs Act question entirely and affirm on the plain text of the TCPA. McKesson argues the TCPA's definition of a \"telephone facsimile machine\" \u2014 one with the capacity \"to transcribe text or images...onto paper\" (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)) \u2014 unambiguously excludes the online fax services at issue, meaning no violation occurred regardless of the FCC's interpretation.\n\n*   **Assessment of \"Off-Ramps\" (Significantly Updated):** The BIO clarifies and multiplies the potential \"off-ramps\" the Court could take to issue a narrow ruling or avoid the main question.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Interpretive Rule\" Off-Ramp:** This path is now directly contested by McKesson's characterization of the FCC order as an adjudication, creating a threshold dispute over the nature of the agency action itself.\n    *   **Respondent's \"Statutory Interpretation\" Off-Ramp:** McKesson is heavily promoting this alternative path. It offers the Court a classic judicial minimalist route: resolve the case in McKesson's favor by ruling that the TCPA's text doesn't cover the conduct, thereby obviating any need to address the complex jurisdictional question of the Hobbs Act.\n    *   **New Procedural Off-Ramps:** McKesson has introduced two new potential exits: (1) ruling the case is not ripe or is a poor vehicle because the underlying FCC order is not yet final, or (2) ruling the petitioner is precluded from challenging the order due to its failure to exhaust administrative review options.\n\n*   **Prediction & Confidence (Adjusted):** The case remains highly competitive, but the numerous and plausible off-ramps introduced by McKesson increase the probability of an affirmance. A victory for the petitioner now requires not only persuading the Court on its Hobbs Act argument but also convincing the Court to bypass these multiple, dispositive, alternative grounds. The pathways to a win for McKesson are now clearer and more varied. The plausible outcomes are:\n    1.  **Reversal on Broad Grounds:** Adopting the petitioner's view on the Hobbs Act. (Slightly less likely now, given the attractiveness of the off-ramps).\n    2.  **Reversal on Narrow Grounds:** Ruling the FCC order is a non-binding interpretive rule. (Now directly contested).\n    3.  **Affirmance on Hobbs Act Grounds:** Accepting the Ninth Circuit's \"collateral attack\" theory.\n    4.  **Affirmance on Alternative Statutory Grounds:** Ruling the TCPA's plain text does not cover the conduct and declining to reach the Hobbs Act question. (The probability of this outcome has increased significantly).\n    5.  **Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) or Vacatur:** Dismissing the case due to the vehicular/procedural problems raised by McKesson (e.g., ongoing agency review). (A newly identified, plausible outcome).\n\n*   **Remaining Uncertainty (Refined):** The most critical missing information remains the respondent's full merits brief and the brief from the Solicitor General. However, my uncertainty has shifted. I am no longer uncertain *what* McKesson will argue, but rather *how effectively* they will develop these arguments in their merits brief and how they will rebut the petitioner's detailed textual analysis of the Hobbs Act. The Solicitor General's position on the various off-ramps will be particularly informative, as it will signal the government's view on both the jurisdictional question and the viability of the alternative grounds for affirmance.",

L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. \n2394.  In this case, petitioner sued respondents in fed-\neral district court, alleging that respondents had vio-\nlated the TCPA by transmitting unsolicited faxes.  Dur-\ning the litigation, the FCC\u2019s Consumer and Governmen-\ntal Affairs Bureau issued an order clarifying that unso-\nlicited faxes sent to online fax services do not violate the \nTCPA.  The district court concluded that, in light of the \nHobbs Act, the court was required to adhere to the Bu-\nreau\u2019s order and to reject petitioner\u2019s effort to impose \nTCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited faxes sent \nto an online fax service.  The court of appeals affirmed.  \nThe question presented is as follows: \nWhether the Hobbs Act\u2019s vesting of \u201cexclusive juris-\ndiction\u201d in the courts of appeals to \u201cdetermine the va-\nlidity\u201d of a covered agency action, 28 U.S.C. 2342, bars \ncollateral attacks on the same agency action in district-\ncourt litigation between private parties. \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument: \nThe Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks on the validity of \na covered FCC order in district-court litigation \nbetween private parties .......................................................... 9 \nA.

The \nparties in this case dispute whether that exclusivity pro-\nvision bars litigants from contesting the legality of the \nspecified agency orders in private district-court litiga-\ntion.  Such collateral attacks would undermine the in-\nterests of regulated parties and of the federal agencies \ninvolved in promptly and conclusively determining the \nvalidity of covered agency actions.  The United States \ntherefore has a substantial interest in the question pre-\nsented. \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutes are reprinted in an appendix to \nthis brief.  App., infra, 1a-11a. \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Hobbs Act gives courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in \npart), or to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d certain agency  \nactions, including \u201call final orders\u201d of the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC) \u201cmade reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  The Act \nalso applies to specified actions of the Secretary  \nof Agriculture, Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-\nopment, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Trans-\nportation, Board of Immigration Appeals, Federal Mar-\nitime Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nand Surface Transportation Board.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1252(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. 2342(2)-(7); 50 U.S.C. 167h(b); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 5841(f\u200a). \n\u201cAny party aggrieved by\u201d a final agency action cov-\nered by the statute \u201cmay, within 60 days after its entry, \nfile a petition to review the order in the court of appeals \nwherein venue lies.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  \u201cThe action shall \nbe against the United States,\u201d ibid., and the \u201cagency  \n* * *  may appear as [a] part[y] thereto  * * *  as of \nright,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2348.  When more than one petition for \nreview is filed with respect to a particular final agency \norder, the petitions are consolidated in a single court of \nappeals.  28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). \nCongress enacted the Hobbs Act in 1950, following a \nrequest by Chief Justice Stone to reform the judicial-\nreview procedures that had previously applied under \nthe Act of Oct. 22, 1913 (Urgent Deficiencies Act), ch. \n32, 38 Stat. 208, to certain FCC orders and other agency \nactions.  See H.R. Rep. No. 2122, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.  \n\n3 \n \n2 (1950).  Under the prior scheme, litigants could seek \nreview in a three-judge district court under specialized \nprocedures, with a right of appeal to this Court.  Ibid.  \nThe Hobbs Act replaced that scheme with a system of \nexclusive circuit-court review under which the Attorney \nGeneral can \u201crepresent the interest of the Government \nwhenever an order of one of the specified agencies is  \nreviewed.\u201d  Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. \nRederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 70 (1970). \n2. a. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of \n1991 (TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, gen-\nerally prohibits sending an unsolicited advertisement to \na \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d from another such ma-\nchine or from a computer or other device.  47 U.S.C. \n227(b)(1)(C).  The statute defines \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d to mean \u201cequipment which has the capacity \n(A) to transcribe text or images, or both, from paper \ninto an electronic signal and to transmit that signal over \na regular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or im-\nages (or both) from an electronic signal received over a \nregular telephone line onto paper.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 227(a)(3). \nThe FCC administers the TCPA.  47 U.S.C. 227(b)(2) \n(2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  In certain circumstances, the \nagency\u2019s Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau \nis authorized to act on the Commission\u2019s behalf.  47 \nC.F.R. 0.141(a), 0.361.  When the Bureau exercises au-\nthority delegated by the Commission, any \u201cperson ag-\ngrieved  * * *  may file an application for review by the \nCommission  * * *  and every such application shall be \npassed upon by the Commission.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4); \nsee 47 C.F.R. 1.115(a).  The filing of such an application \nfor review is a \u201ccondition precedent to judicial review\u201d \nof an action taken by the Bureau on delegated authority.  \n47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7); see 47 C.F.R. 1.115(k). \n\n4 \n \nThe government may enforce the TCPA.  See, e.g., \n47 U.S.C. 501-503.  The TCPA also creates private rights \nof action to enforce certain provisions and regulations.  \n47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3) and (c)(5).  Federal and state courts \nhave concurrent jurisdiction over private TCPA law-\nsuits.  Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n371-372 (2012). \nb. In 2002, the FCC sought public comment on a va-\nriety of TCPA-related issues, including the proper \ntreatment of \u201cfax servers.\u201d  17 FCC Rcd 17,459, 17,482 \n\u00b6 37.  In 2003, the agency issued an order finalizing \nchanges to its rules.  18 FCC Rcd 14,014, 14,017 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.  \nThe FCC explained that fax servers \u201cenable multiple \ndesktops to send and receive faxes from the same or \nshared telephone lines.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 200.  Some com-\nmenters had argued that faxes transmitted to fax serv-\ners are not covered by the TCPA because such faxes are \nnot necessarily \u201creduced to paper.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 199.  \nThe Commission disagreed, explaining that the statu-\ntory definition of a \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d en-\ncompasses devices that have \u201cthe capacity to transcribe \ntext or images\u201d to paper.  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 201. \nIn 2009, a regulated party petitioned the FCC for \nclarification of how the TCPA \u201capplies to the transmis-\nsion of efaxes,\u201d which the party described as \u201c\u200a\u2018a fax that \nis converted to email\u2019\u200a\u201d after being received.  30 FCC \nRcd 8620, 8621 \u00b6 4 (2015).  The petition was referred to \nthe Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, which \nsolicited public comment and ultimately concluded that \n\u201cefaxes are subject to the TCPA.\u201d  Id. at 8622 \u00b6 7. \nIn 2017, the Bureau received a petition for a declar-\natory ruling regarding the application of the TCPA to a \n\u201ccloud-based\u201d online fax service, in which faxes received \nby the service are made available to users digitally,  \n\n5 \n \neither via a website or as email attachments.  34 FCC \nRcd 11,950, 11,950 \u00b6 2 (2019) (Amerifactors) (citation \nomitted); see id. at 11,951 \u00b6 6.  After seeking public com-\nment, the Bureau concluded in a 2019 order that faxes \nsent to such an online fax service are \u201coutside the scope\u201d \nof the TCPA.  Id. at 11,952 \u00b6 8.  The Bureau explained \nthat the cloud service \u201ccannot itself print a fax\u2014the \nuser of an online fax service must connect his or her own \nequipment in order to do so.\u201d  Id. at 11,953 \u00b6 11. \nIn 2020, the Commission received an application for \nreview of the Bureau\u2019s Amerifactors order.  See Career \nCounseling Services\u2019 Application for Review, In re \nAmerifactors Financial Group, LLC Petition for Expe-\ndited Declaratory Ruling, CG Docket Nos. 02-278, 05-\n338 (Jan. 8, 2020).  That application remains pending \nwith the Commission. \n3. The present controversy arises from a private \nTCPA suit in the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of California, which petitioner joined \nas a co-plaintiff in 2014.  Pet. App. 25a.  The gravamen \nof the complaint is that respondents \u201cviolated the TCPA \nby sending \u2018unsolicited advertisements\u2019 by fax.\u201d  Ibid. \n(citation omitted). \nThe district court initially denied a motion for class \ncertification; the plaintiffs appealed; and the court of \nappeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and re-\nmanded.  896 F.3d 923, 926, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2743.  \nOn remand, the district court granted a renewed motion \nfor class certification, appointed petitioner to represent \nthe class, and denied respondents\u2019 motion for summary \njudgment.  332 F.R.D. 589, 610. \nIn 2020, respondents moved to decertify the class on \nthe theory that, in light of Amerifactors, \u201cindividualized \ninquiries\u201d would be necessary \u201cto determine whether \n\n6 \n \nclass members received the advertisements through \nonline fax services or traditional analog fax machines.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a.  The district court understood circuit \nprecedent to require it to treat Amerifactors as \u201cau-\nthoritative.\u201d  Id. at 36a.  But rather than decertify the \nclass, the court initially bifurcated it into two groups, \ndepending on whether particular class members had re-\nceived advertisements via a \u201c\u200a\u2018stand-alone\u2019 fax machine\u201d \nor via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 39a-40a.  Based on \nAmerifactors, the court later entered summary judg-\nment for respondents on all TCPA claims asserted by \nthe online-fax-service class.  Id. at 21a-23a. \nAfter further discovery, the district court decertified \nthe standalone-fax-machine class.  Pet. App. 12a-20a.  \nThe court concluded that no reliable method existed to \nshow \u201cvia classwide, common proof\u200a\u201d which faxes were \nsent to standalone fax machines rather than online fax \nservices, so that individualized questions about how a \ngiven plaintiff received a given fax would predominate \nover any common questions.  Id. at 15a; see id. at 18a. \n4. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-11a.  \nAs relevant here, the court held that the district court \nhad \u201ccorrectly found that it was bound by\u201d the \u201cAmerifac-\ntors declaratory ruling, which determined that the \nTCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Petitioner had argued \nthat the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision does not ap-\nply because \u201cAmerifactors is neither an order of the \nCommission, nor final.\u201d  Ibid.  The court of appeals \nacknowledged that an application for Commission re-\nview of Amerifactors remained pending, but the court \nconcluded that Amerifactors nonetheless constitutes a \n\u201cfinal order of the Commission made reviewable by Sec-\ntion 402(a)\u201d of Title 47.  Id. at 8a-9a.  The court based \n\n7 \n \nthat conclusion on circuit precedent and on an FCC reg-\nulation stating that Bureau orders are generally effec-\ntive upon release.  See id. at 7a-8a & n.1.  Accordingly, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the district court \nlacked authority to \u201cdisagree[] with Amerifactors\u201d by \nimposing TCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited \nfaxes sent to online fax services.  Id. at 9a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars district \ncourts from entertaining collateral attacks on covered \nagency actions in litigation between private parties.   \nA.  As an initial matter, this case comes to the Court \nbased on an erroneous premise.  The courts below viewed \nAmerifactors as a \u201cfinal order of the [FCC] made re-\nviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  \nBut Amerifactors was issued by a bureau of the FCC on \ndelegated authority, and an application for Commission \nreview of the order remains pending.  Because the Com-\nmission\u2019s disposition of the pending application is a \n\u201ccondition precedent\u201d to judicial review, 47 U.S.C. \n155(c)(7), Amerifactors has never been susceptible to \ndirect court-of-appeals review, and the exclusivity pro-\nvision does not apply to it. \nB.  If the Court assumes for purposes of this case \nthat Amerifactors is a final order to which the Hobbs \nA\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. \n2394.  In this case, petitioner sued respondents in fed-\neral district court, alleging that respondents had vio-\nlated the TCPA by transmitting unsolicited faxes.  Dur-\ning the litigation, the FCC\u2019s Consumer and Governmen-\ntal Affairs Bureau issued an order clarifying that unso-\nlicited faxes sent to online fax services do not violate the \nTCPA.  The district court concluded that, in light of the \nHobbs Act, the court was required to adhere to the Bu-\nreau\u2019s order and to reject petitioner\u2019s effort to impose \nTCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited faxes sent \nto an online fax service.  The court of appeals affirmed.  \nThe question presented is as follows: \nWhether the Hobbs Act\u2019s vesting of \u201cexclusive juris-\ndiction\u201d in the courts of appeals to \u201cdetermine the va-\nlidity\u201d of a covered agency action, 28 U.S.C. 2342, bars \ncollateral attacks on the same agency action in district-\ncourt litigation between private parties. \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument: \nThe Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks on the validity of \na covered FCC order in district-court litigation \nbetween private parties .......................................................... 9 \nA.

The \nparties in this case dispute whether that exclusivity pro-\nvision bars litigants from contesting the legality of the \nspecified agency orders in private district-court litiga-\ntion.  Such collateral attacks would undermine the in-\nterests of regulated parties and of the federal agencies \ninvolved in promptly and conclusively determining the \nvalidity of covered agency actions.  The United States \ntherefore has a substantial interest in the question pre-\nsented. \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutes are reprinted in an appendix to \nthis brief.  App., infra, 1a-11a. \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Hobbs Act gives courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in \npart), or to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d certain agency  \nactions, including \u201call final orders\u201d of the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC) \u201cmade reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  The Act \nalso applies to specified actions of the Secretary  \nof Agriculture, Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-\nopment, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Trans-\nportation, Board of Immigration Appeals, Federal Mar-\nitime Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nand Surface Transportation Board.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1252(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. 2342(2)-(7); 50 U.S.C. 167h(b); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 5841(f\u200a). \n\u201cAny party aggrieved by\u201d a final agency action cov-\nered by the statute \u201cmay, within 60 days after its entry, \nfile a petition to review the order in the court of appeals \nwherein venue lies.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  \u201cThe action shall \nbe against the United States,\u201d ibid., and the \u201cagency  \n* * *  may appear as [a] part[y] thereto  * * *  as of \nright,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2348.  When more than one petition for \nreview is filed with respect to a particular final agency \norder, the petitions are consolidated in a single court of \nappeals.  28 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). \nCongress enacted the Hobbs Act in 1950, following a \nrequest by Chief Justice Stone to reform the judicial-\nreview procedures that had previously applied under \nthe Act of Oct. 22, 1913 (Urgent Deficiencies Act), ch. \n32, 38 Stat. 208, to certain FCC orders and other agency \nactions.  See H.R. Rep. No. 2122, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.  \n\n3 \n \n2 (1950).  Under the prior scheme, litigants could seek \nreview in a three-judge district court under specialized \nprocedures, with a right of appeal to this Court.  Ibid.  \nThe Hobbs Act replaced that scheme with a system of \nexclusive circuit-court review under which the Attorney \nGeneral can \u201crepresent the interest of the Government \nwhenever an order of one of the specified agencies is  \nreviewed.\u201d  Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. \nRederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 70 (1970). \n2. a. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of \n1991 (TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, gen-\nerally prohibits sending an unsolicited advertisement to \na \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d from another such ma-\nchine or from a computer or other device.  47 U.S.C. \n227(b)(1)(C).  The statute defines \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d to mean \u201cequipment which has the capacity \n(A) to transcribe text or images, or both, from paper \ninto an electronic signal and to transmit that signal over \na regular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or im-\nages (or both) from an electronic signal received over a \nregular telephone line onto paper.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 227(a)(3). \nThe FCC administers the TCPA.  47 U.S.C. 227(b)(2) \n(2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  In certain circumstances, the \nagency\u2019s Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau \nis authorized to act on the Commission\u2019s behalf.  47 \nC.F.R. 0.141(a), 0.361.  When the Bureau exercises au-\nthority delegated by the Commission, any \u201cperson ag-\ngrieved  * * *  may file an application for review by the \nCommission  * * *  and every such application shall be \npassed upon by the Commission.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4); \nsee 47 C.F.R. 1.115(a).  The filing of such an application \nfor review is a \u201ccondition precedent to judicial review\u201d \nof an action taken by the Bureau on delegated authority.  \n47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7); see 47 C.F.R. 1.115(k). \n\n4 \n \nThe government may enforce the TCPA.  See, e.g., \n47 U.S.C. 501-503.  The TCPA also creates private rights \nof action to enforce certain provisions and regulations.  \n47 U.S.C. 227(b)(3) and (c)(5).  Federal and state courts \nhave concurrent jurisdiction over private TCPA law-\nsuits.  Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n371-372 (2012). \nb. In 2002, the FCC sought public comment on a va-\nriety of TCPA-related issues, including the proper \ntreatment of \u201cfax servers.\u201d  17 FCC Rcd 17,459, 17,482 \n\u00b6 37.  In 2003, the agency issued an order finalizing \nchanges to its rules.  18 FCC Rcd 14,014, 14,017 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.  \nThe FCC explained that fax servers \u201cenable multiple \ndesktops to send and receive faxes from the same or \nshared telephone lines.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 200.  Some com-\nmenters had argued that faxes transmitted to fax serv-\ners are not covered by the TCPA because such faxes are \nnot necessarily \u201creduced to paper.\u201d  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 199.  \nThe Commission disagreed, explaining that the statu-\ntory definition of a \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d en-\ncompasses devices that have \u201cthe capacity to transcribe \ntext or images\u201d to paper.  Id. at 14,133 \u00b6 201. \nIn 2009, a regulated party petitioned the FCC for \nclarification of how the TCPA \u201capplies to the transmis-\nsion of efaxes,\u201d which the party described as \u201c\u200a\u2018a fax that \nis converted to email\u2019\u200a\u201d after being received.  30 FCC \nRcd 8620, 8621 \u00b6 4 (2015).  The petition was referred to \nthe Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, which \nsolicited public comment and ultimately concluded that \n\u201cefaxes are subject to the TCPA.\u201d  Id. at 8622 \u00b6 7. \nIn 2017, the Bureau received a petition for a declar-\natory ruling regarding the application of the TCPA to a \n\u201ccloud-based\u201d online fax service, in which faxes received \nby the service are made available to users digitally,  \n\n5 \n \neither via a website or as email attachments.  34 FCC \nRcd 11,950, 11,950 \u00b6 2 (2019) (Amerifactors) (citation \nomitted); see id. at 11,951 \u00b6 6.  After seeking public com-\nment, the Bureau concluded in a 2019 order that faxes \nsent to such an online fax service are \u201coutside the scope\u201d \nof the TCPA.  Id. at 11,952 \u00b6 8.  The Bureau explained \nthat the cloud service \u201ccannot itself print a fax\u2014the \nuser of an online fax service must connect his or her own \nequipment in order to do so.\u201d  Id. at 11,953 \u00b6 11. \nIn 2020, the Commission received an application for \nreview of the Bureau\u2019s Amerifactors order.  See Career \nCounseling Services\u2019 Application for Review, In re \nAmerifactors Financial Group, LLC Petition for Expe-\ndited Declaratory Ruling, CG Docket Nos. 02-278, 05-\n338 (Jan. 8, 2020).  That application remains pending \nwith the Commission. \n3. The present controversy arises from a private \nTCPA suit in the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of California, which petitioner joined \nas a co-plaintiff in 2014.  Pet. App. 25a.  The gravamen \nof the complaint is that respondents \u201cviolated the TCPA \nby sending \u2018unsolicited advertisements\u2019 by fax.\u201d  Ibid. \n(citation omitted). \nThe district court initially denied a motion for class \ncertification; the plaintiffs appealed; and the court of \nappeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and re-\nmanded.  896 F.3d 923, 926, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2743.  \nOn remand, the district court granted a renewed motion \nfor class certification, appointed petitioner to represent \nthe class, and denied respondents\u2019 motion for summary \njudgment.  332 F.R.D. 589, 610. \nIn 2020, respondents moved to decertify the class on \nthe theory that, in light of Amerifactors, \u201cindividualized \ninquiries\u201d would be necessary \u201cto determine whether \n\n6 \n \nclass members received the advertisements through \nonline fax services or traditional analog fax machines.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a.  The district court understood circuit \nprecedent to require it to treat Amerifactors as \u201cau-\nthoritative.\u201d  Id. at 36a.  But rather than decertify the \nclass, the court initially bifurcated it into two groups, \ndepending on whether particular class members had re-\nceived advertisements via a \u201c\u200a\u2018stand-alone\u2019 fax machine\u201d \nor via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 39a-40a.  Based on \nAmerifactors, the court later entered summary judg-\nment for respondents on all TCPA claims asserted by \nthe online-fax-service class.  Id. at 21a-23a. \nAfter further discovery, the district court decertified \nthe standalone-fax-machine class.  Pet. App. 12a-20a.  \nThe court concluded that no reliable method existed to \nshow \u201cvia classwide, common proof\u200a\u201d which faxes were \nsent to standalone fax machines rather than online fax \nservices, so that individualized questions about how a \ngiven plaintiff received a given fax would predominate \nover any common questions.  Id. at 15a; see id. at 18a. \n4. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-11a.  \nAs relevant here, the court held that the district court \nhad \u201ccorrectly found that it was bound by\u201d the \u201cAmerifac-\ntors declaratory ruling, which determined that the \nTCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Petitioner had argued \nthat the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision does not ap-\nply because \u201cAmerifactors is neither an order of the \nCommission, nor final.\u201d  Ibid.  The court of appeals \nacknowledged that an application for Commission re-\nview of Amerifactors remained pending, but the court \nconcluded that Amerifactors nonetheless constitutes a \n\u201cfinal order of the Commission made reviewable by Sec-\ntion 402(a)\u201d of Title 47.  Id. at 8a-9a.  The court based \n\n7 \n \nthat conclusion on circuit precedent and on an FCC reg-\nulation stating that Bureau orders are generally effec-\ntive upon release.  See id. at 7a-8a & n.1.  Accordingly, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the district court \nlacked authority to \u201cdisagree[] with Amerifactors\u201d by \nimposing TCPA liability on respondents for unsolicited \nfaxes sent to online fax services.  Id. at 9a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars district \ncourts from entertaining collateral attacks on covered \nagency actions in litigation between private parties.   \nA.  As an initial matter, this case comes to the Court \nbased on an erroneous premise.  The courts below viewed \nAmerifactors as a \u201cfinal order of the [FCC] made re-\nviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  \nBut Amerifactors was issued by a bureau of the FCC on \ndelegated authority, and an application for Commission \nreview of the order remains pending.  Because the Com-\nmission\u2019s disposition of the pending application is a \n\u201ccondition precedent\u201d to judicial review, 47 U.S.C. \n155(c)(7), Amerifactors has never been susceptible to \ndirect court-of-appeals review, and the exclusivity pro-\nvision does not apply to it. \nB.  If the Court assumes for purposes of this case \nthat Amerifactors is a final order to which the Hobbs \nAct applies, the judgment below should be affirmed. \nThe Hobbs Act vests courts of appeals with \u201cexclu-\nsive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of covered \nagency actions.  28 U.S.C. 2342.  A court \u201cdetermine[s]\u201d \nan action\u2019s \u201cvalidity\u201d when it resolves a dispute about \nwhether the action is sound or lawful.  Ibid.  The plain \nlanguage of the statute therefore encompasses the situ-\nation in which a party to private litigation asks the court \nto adopt an interpretation of a statute that a covered \n\n8 \n \nagency order rejects.  Consistent with the statutory \ntext, this Court has previously construed the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s exclusivity provision to bar a collateral attack on \nan agency action in a district-court damages suit be-\ntween private parties.  See Port of Boston Marine Ter-\nminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 \nU.S. 62, 69-72 (1970). \nThe statutory history confirms the clear import of \nthe text.  Congress derived the relevant language from \nthe Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, ch. 26, 56 \nStat. 23, after this Court had construed that statute to \nbar collateral attacks on covered agency actions even in \nenforcement proceedings.  Yakus v. United States, 321 \nU.S. 414, 429-430 (1944).  The Hobbs Act operates the \nsame way.  That understanding is further supported by \nthis Court\u2019s precedent interpreting the pre-Hobbs Act \nstatutory scheme for judicial review of FCC orders. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act would \nundermine its purposes and structure.  The Act is de-\nsigned to achieve certainty and finality by providing a \ncentralized forum for judicial review of covered agency \nactions, in which the presence of the United States as a \nparty is ensured.  Allowing litigants to collaterally attack \ncovered agency actions in private district-court litigation \nwould disserve those interests. \nC.  Any presumption of judicial review does not help \npetitioner because the Hobbs Act provides for review in \nan Article III court.  Similarly, while 5 U.S.C. 703 es-\ntablishes a general rule that agency action may be chal-\nlenged during enforcement suits, that rule does not ap-\nply where a \u201cprior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity \nfor judicial review is provided by law.\u201d  Ibid.  The other \nstatutes to which petitioner seeks to compare the Hobbs \n\n9 \n \nAct contain materially different language.  And the \ncanon of constitutional avoidance does not apply here. \nD.  Petitioner contends in the alternative that the \nHobbs Act at least does not prevent district courts from \nadjudicating collateral attacks on interpretive rules or \nguidance documents.  Amerifactors is a declaratory or-\nder, not a rule.  In any event, the Hobbs Act contains no \nexception for interpretive agency actions.  Where an in-\nterpretive rule or order is reviewable by a court of ap-\npeals under the Hobbs Act, district courts lack author-\nity to determine the action\u2019s validity. \nARGUMENT \nTHE HOBBS ACT BARS COLLATERAL ATTACKS ON THE \nVALIDITY OF A COVERED FCC ORDER IN DISTRICT-\nCOURT LITIGATION BETWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES \nThe Hobbs Act vests courts of appeals with \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d specified cat-\negories of agency actions, including certain \u201cfinal orders \nof the\u201d FCC.  28 U.S.C. 2342(1).  The decision below rests \non the premise that, for purposes of the Hobbs Act, the \nAmerifactors order issued in 2019 by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau is a \u201cfinal or-\nder[] of the\u201d Commission that is \u201cmade reviewable by \nsection 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 7a-8a.   \nAlthough petitioner does not contest that premise, it is \nincorrect.  But accepting that premise for purposes of \nthis case, the judgment below should be affirmed. \nUnder the Hobbs Act\u2019s jurisdiction-channeling pro-\nvision, covered agency actions may not be collaterally \nattacked in district court, including in litigation be-\ntween private parties.  Accordingly, if Amerifactors is \ntreated as a final FCC order subject to Hobbs Act re-\nview in a court of appeals, the district court correctly \nconcluded that it lacked authority to impose liability on \n\n10 \n \nrespondents for conduct that does not violate the TCPA \nas interpreted in Amerifactors. \nA. The Decision Below Rests On An Incorrect Premise \nThe court of appeals erred in treating the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order as a \u201cfinal order[] of the Commis-\nsion\u201d that is \u201cmade reviewable by section 402(a) of title \n47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(1); see Pet. App. 8a-9a.  The FCC \nmay delegate certain functions to \u201can employee board\u201d \nwithin the agency, such as the Bureau.  47 U.S.C. \n155(c)(1).  An order issued \u201cpursuant to any such dele-\ngation  * * *  shall have the same force and effect\u201d as an \norder by the Commission \u201cunless\u201d it is \u201creviewed\u201d by \nthe Commission, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(3), which may do so \nsua sponte or upon the filing of an application for re-\nview, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4).  Filing an application for Com-\nmission review is \u201ca condition precedent to judicial re-\nview of any order  * * *  made\u201d pursuant to a delegation \nof authority from the Commission.  47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7). \nAlthough the statutory text makes the \u201cfiling\u201d of an \napplication for review a prerequisite to judicial review, \n47 U.S.C. 155(c)(7), the courts of appeals have correctly \nunderstood that provision to mean that the aggrieved \nperson must \u201cawait the Commission\u2019s disposition\u201d of \nthe application before seeking judicial review.  Interna-\ntional Telecard Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 166 F.3d 387, 388 (D.C. \nCir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1146 (1999); \nsee, e.g., Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 937 (2003); \nCellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC, 205 F.3d 82, 88-89 (2d \nCir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1070 (2001).  Accord-\ningly, a petition for review is \u201cincurably premature\u201d if \nthe petition seeks judicial review of an order issued on \ndelegated authority while an application for review of \n\n11 \n \nthat order remains pending before the Commission.  In-\nternational Telecard, 166 F.3d at 388. \nHere, a statutory \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to judicial re-\nview of Amerifactors under 47 U.S.C. 402(a)\u2014the Com-\nmission\u2019s disposition of the pending application for re-\nview of the Bureau\u2019s order\u2014remains unfulfilled.  47 \nU.S.C. 155(c)(7); see p. 5, supra.  Amerifactors is there-\nfore not presently a \u201cfinal order[] of the [FCC] made \nreviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2342(1); see 47 U.S.C. 402(a).  The Hobbs Act does not \ncurrently authorize any court of appeals to review \nAmerifactors, nor does it preclude district courts from \ndetermining that order\u2019s validity.1 \nIn PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiro-\npractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the Court stated that it \nwould \u201cassume without deciding\u201d that the FCC action \nat issue there was \u201ca \u2018final order\u2019\u200a\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  \nId. at 6.  Finality had not been disputed in that case.  \nSee ibid.  By contrast, petitioner argued below that \nAmerifactors is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d for purposes of the \nHobbs Act, but the court of appeals rejected that argu-\nment, see pp. 6-7, supra, and petitioner did not seek this \nCourt\u2019s review of that holding.  Given petitioner\u2019s litiga-\ntion choice and this Court\u2019s grant of certiorari, the \n \n1 The situation would be different if the time for filing an applica-\ntion for Commission review of Amerifactors had expired without \nany aggrieved person filing such an application.  In those circum-\nstances, the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision would apply because \nAmerifactors would be properly treated as a \u201cfinal order[] of the \n[FCC] made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47,\u201d even though \nno party took the necessary steps to perfect such review.  28 U.S.C. \n2342(1).  Applying the exclusivity provision in those circumstances \nwould be no different from applying it when judicial review under \nthe Hobbs Act is available for an agency action but no party seeks \nreview within the 60-day period prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 2344. \n\n12 \n \nCourt may assume for purposes of this case that the \nAmerifactors order is covered by Section 2342(1) and \ntherefore could have been challenged directly in a court \nof appeals through the Hobbs Act\u2019s review mechanism. \nB. The Hobbs Act Provides The Exclusive Mechanism For  \nObtaining Judicial Review Of Covered Agency Orders \nAssuming that the Amerifactors order could have \nbeen challenged in a court of appeals under the Hobbs \nAct, the Act bars petitioner from pursuing a claim of \nprivate TCPA liability that is inconsistent with that or-\nder.  The Hobbs Act\u2019s text forecloses such collateral at-\ntacks, and the statute\u2019s history and purposes confirm \nthe clear import of the statutory language. \n1. The Hobbs Act\u2019s plain language precludes district-\ncourt review of agency actions covered by 28 U.S.C. \n2342 \na. The Hobbs Act gives courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction  * * *  to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d specified \ncategories of agency action.  28 U.S.C. 2342.  To \u201cdeter-\nmine\u201d an issue means \u201c[t]o settle a question or contro-\nversy about\u201d it or \u201cto decide [it] by authoritative or  \njudicial sentence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 711 (2d ed. 1958) \n(Webster\u2019s Second); see 4 The Oxford English Diction-\nary 550 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\u201cTo settle or decide (a dis-\npute, question, matter in debate) as a judge or arbi-\nter.\u201d).  The term \u201cvalidity\u201d refers in this context to hav-\ning \u201c[l]egal strength, force, or authority\u201d or to being \n\u201cgrounded\u201d in \u201csound principles.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Second \n2814; accord 19 OED 410; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1870 \n(12th ed. 2024); 3 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary and Con-\ncise Encyclopedia 3387 (3d rev. 8th ed. 1914).  The \nHobbs Act thus gives the courts of appeals exclusive au-\n\n13 \n \nthority to decide any question about the lawfulness of a \ncovered agency action. \nPetitioner accepts that determining the validity of an \nagency order means deciding \u201cwhether the order has \n\u2018legal force\u2019 or is \u2018effective or binding.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. Br. 21.  Pe-\ntitioner maintains, however, that a court makes such a \ndetermination \u201conly by entering a declaratory judg-\nment that the order is valid or invalid.\u201d  Id. at 22 (quot-\ning PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21 (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)).  Entering a judgment declar-\ning an agency action to be invalid (or valid) is surely one \nmeans of determining the validity of that action.  But \npetitioner identifies no dictionary, treatise, or other \nsource that defines the words \u201cdetermine\u201d or \u201cvalidity\u201d \nas referring exclusively to the entry of a declaratory \njudgment. \nA court that finds an agency\u2019s order to be incon-\nsistent with a statute, and therefore disregards the or-\nder in adjudicating one private party\u2019s liability to an-\nother, is naturally said to \u201cdetermine\u201d the order\u2019s \u201cva-\nlidity.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342.  It likewise would be natural to \nsay that in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 \n(1803), this Court determined the validity of the statute \nthat purported to grant the Court original jurisdiction \nover mandamus petitions.  The Court held that the stat-\nute was unconstitutional, declined to give it effect, and \nthen dismissed the proceeding for want of appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  See id. at 173-180.  Entry of an injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment will sometimes be an appropriate \nremedial step after the court has determined whether \nan agency action is lawful.  But whenever a court de-\ncides whether an agency action is lawful or unlawful in \nthe course of resolving a case before it, the court is \u201cde-\ntermin[ing] the validity of\u200a\u201d that action. \n\n14 \n \nPetitioner suggests that it did not ask the district \ncourt to determine the validity of Amerifactors because \nthe judgment that petitioner sought would have left the \nagency free to \u201cenforce the order against others.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 20 (quoting PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21 (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment)).  But that \nwould be equally true for a declaratory judgment issued \nby a district court, which would bind only the parties.  \nSee United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 162-163 \n(1984) (federal government is not subject to nonmutual \ncollateral estoppel).  Indeed, under petitioner\u2019s ap-\nproach, a court of appeals that upheld a covered agency \naction on direct Hobbs Act review would not \u201cdetermine \n[the action\u2019s] validity,\u201d since petitioner views such court \nof appeals decisions as binding only on the parties.  See \nPet. Br. 31 n.6. \nb. Petitioner argues that, under the interpretive \nprinciple noscitur a sociis, the terms \u201c\u200a\u2018enjoin,\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201c\u200a\u2018sus-\npend,\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018set aside\u2019\u200a\u201d all refer \u201cto specific kinds of \nequitable relief,\u201d and that \u201c\u200a\u2018determine the validity\u2019 is \nbest read to do the same.\u201d  Pet. Br. 22-23 (citations omit-\nted); see 28 U.S.C. 2342 (\u201cto enjoin, set aside, suspend \n(in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of\u200a\u201d).  \nBut noscitur a sociis has \u201cno place, as this Court has \nmany times held, except in the domain of ambiguity.\u201d  \nRussell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, \n519 (1923); see United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, \n474-475 (2010).  The phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d \nunambiguously encompasses deciding the lawfulness of \nan agency order in the course of resolving a dispute be-\ntween private parties. \nPetitioner\u2019s understanding of the surrounding text is \nalso incorrect.  Petitioner assumes that to \u201c[s]et aside\u201d \nan agency order must mean to \u201cannul or vacate\u201d it.  Pet. \n\n15 \n \nBr. 23 (citation omitted).  But as three Members of this \nCourt recently recognized in assessing a court\u2019s author-\nity to \u201cset aside\u201d agency action under 5 U.S.C. 706(2) (a \nprovision originally enacted in the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act (APA), ch. 324, \u00a7 10(e), 60 Stat. 243, four \nyears before Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, see p. 2, \nsupra), that language permits a reviewing court to \u201c\u200a\u2018set \naside\u2019\u200a\u201d agency action by \u201c\u200a\u2018disregard[ing]\u2019\u200a\u201d the action as \nunlawful and resolving the dispute before the court \nwithout the agency action figuring into the \u201cdecisional \nprocess.\u201d  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 696 \n(2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the judgment).2 \nIn any event, the phrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d \nshould be given its natural meaning, however the Court \nconstrues the separate phrase \u201cset aside.\u201d  Contrary to \npetitioner\u2019s suggestion (Br. 24), reading Section 2342 in \nthat way would not render any of its language \u201csuper-\nfluous.\u201d  A court might be asked to \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d \nor \u201csuspend\u201d a covered agency action without conclu-\nsively determining its validity\u2014for example, when a \nparty seeks a preliminary injunction.  Congress there-\nfore had good reason to include the complete set of \nterms that appears in Section 2342. \nc. The inference that \u201cdetermin[ing]  * * *  validity\u201d \nunder Section 2342 does not refer exclusively to enter-\ning declaratory judgments is bolstered by a comparison \nto 28 U.S.C. 2349(a).  Section 2349(a) states that, when \n \n2 Section 703 of Title 5 contemplates that \u201cjudicial review\u201d of \nagency action may occur in an enforcement proceeding (see p. 26, \ninfra), and Section 706 indicates that a reviewing court may \u201cset \naside\u201d agency action.  5 U.S.C. 703, 706(2).  Taken together, those \nprovisions reinforce the conclusion that a court can \u201cset aside\u201d an \nagency action by disregarding the action as unlawful in the course \nof adjudicating an enforcement suit. \n\n16 \n \na Hobbs Act suit is filed, the court of appeals \u201chas juris-\ndiction to vacate stay orders or interlocutory injunc-\ntions\u201d and \u201cto make and enter, on the petition, evidence, \nand proceedings set forth in the record on review, a \njudgment determining the validity of, and enjoining, \nsetting aside, or suspending, in whole or in part, the or-\nder of the agency.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added). \nPetitioner contends (Br. 25) that Section 2349(a) \n\u201cconfirm[s] that Congress intended the determination \nof an order\u2019s validity to be an equitable remedy awarded \nthrough a declaratory \u2018\u200ajudgment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  But the word \n\u201c\u200ajudgment\u201d appears only in Section 2349(a), not Section \n2342, and its omission from the latter was presumably \ndeliberate and should be given effect.  See Russello v. \nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983).  Section 2349 de-\nlineates the jurisdiction and powers of the reviewing \ncourt when a party properly invokes the Hobbs Act to \nseek direct judicial review of a covered agency action, \nwith the United States named as a party.  By contrast, \nSection 2342\u2019s exclusivity provision forecloses judicial \nreview of covered agency actions outside of the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s review scheme.  And rather than stating that \ncourts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to enter \u201ca \njudgment determining the validity of\u200a\u201d a covered agency \norder, 28 U.S.C. 2349(a), Section 2342 states more \nbroadly that those courts have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto \ndetermine the validity of\u200a\u201d covered orders, 28 U.S.C. \n2342.  Petitioner disregards that textual difference. \n2. This Court has construed the Hobbs Act to bar parties \nin private district-court litigation from collaterally \nattacking covered agency action \nIn Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Reder-\niaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62 (1970) (Trans-\natlantic), vessel owners refused to pay certain cargo \n\n17 \n \nfees, asserting that the absence of pre-approval by the \nFederal Maritime Commission (FMC) rendered the \nfees invalid.  Id. at 64-65.  The port operator brought \nsuit for damages and declaratory relief against a vessel-\nowner organization.  Ibid.  The district court stayed the \nproceedings to allow the parties to obtain a ruling from \nthe FMC, which concluded that the fees were largely \nvalid because they had not required pre-approval.  Id. \nat 65-66.  An affected carrier then moved to intervene \nin the damages action on the ground that the carrier \nwould be liable for part of any judgment.  Id. at 67.  The \ncourt granted leave to intervene, but it refused to con-\nsider the carrier\u2019s argument\u2014raised as a defense to po-\ntential civil liability\u2014that the FMC had erred in deem-\ning the tariff revisions valid.  Ibid. \nThis Court unanimously agreed that the district \ncourt \u201cwas without authority\u201d to consider the carrier\u2019s \nattack on the FMC\u2019s action.  Transatlantic, 400 U.S. at \n69.  The Court grounded that holding in the Hobbs Act\u2019s \nexclusivity provision, explaining that the Act \u201cis ex-\nplicit\u201d in vesting the courts of appeals with \u201c\u200a\u2018exclusive \njurisdiction to  . . .  determine the validity of  . . .  such \nfinal orders of the [FMC].\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting 28 U.S.C. \n2342).  The Court explained that an exception for cases \ninvolving referrals to the FMC \u201cwould vitiate the \nscheme of the [Hobbs Act]\u2014a scheme designed to en-\nsure that the Attorney General has an opportunity to \nrepresent the interest of the Government whenever an \norder of one of the specified agencies is reviewed.\u201d  Id. \nat 70. \nThis Court also rejected the carrier\u2019s argument that \nit should be permitted to mount \u201ca collateral attack on \nthe Commission\u2019s order\u201d because the carrier had not \nbeen a party to the FMC proceedings.  Transatlantic, \n\n18 \n \n400 U.S. at 71.  The Court explained that the carrier was \nin fact \u201crepresented before the Commission and ha[d] \npreviously made numerous claims to party status.\u201d  \nIbid.  The Court also observed that, \u201c[e]ven if [the car-\nrier] was not a formal party\u201d to the administrative pro-\nceeding, its \u201cinterests were clearly at stake,\u201d and its \nlack of party status did not justify allowing a \u201ccollateral \nredetermination of the same issue in a different and in-\nappropriate forum.\u201d  Id. at 72.  The Court also noted \nthat the carrier \u201chad every opportunity to participate \nbefore the Commission and then to seek timely review\u201d \nvia the Hobbs Act but \u201cchose not to do so.\u201d  Ibid. \nIn accordance with Transatlantic, every court of ap-\npeals to address the issue has construed the Hobbs Act \nto bar courts from determining the validity of covered \nagency actions in any proceeding outside the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s channels.  The courts of appeals have applied the \nHobbs Act to preclude challenges to agency regulations \nin suits between private parties, e.g., Mais v. Gulf Coast \nCollection Bureau, Inc., 768 F.3d 1110, 1119-1121 (11th \nCir. 2014); Leyse v. Clear Channel Broad., Inc., 545 \nFed. Appx. 444, 459 (6th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 574 \nU.S. 815 (2014); Nack v. Walburg, 715 F.3d 680, 685-687 \n(8th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1028 (2014); CE \nDesign, Ltd. v. Prism Bus. Media, Inc., 606 F.3d 443, \n447-448 (7th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 1138 \n(2011); Daniels v. Union Pac. R.R., 530 F.3d 936, 940-\n941 (D.C. Cir. 2008); City of Peoria v. General Elec. Ca-\nblevision Corp., 690 F.2d 116, 119-121 (7th Cir. 1982), \nand to preclude the assertion of such challenges as de-\nfenses to civil enforcement actions brought by the gov-\nernment, e.g., United States v. Dunifer, 219 F.3d 1004, \n1007 (9th Cir. 2000); United States v. Any & All Radio \n\n19 \n \nStation Transmission Equip., 207 F.3d 458, 463 (8th \nCir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1071 (2001). \n3. The history of the Hobbs Act and its predecessors  \nreinforces the most natural reading of Section 2342\u2019s \ntext \na. The Hobbs Act\u2019s language vesting the courts of \nappeals with \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u200a\u201d covered orders derives from the Emergency \nPrice Control Act of 1942 (EPCA), ch. 26, 56 Stat. 23.  \nUnder the EPCA, a party that wished to challenge  \norders fixing maximum prices and rents was required \nto file a protest with a federal administrator\u2014and, \nwhen the statute was enacted, to do so within 60 days.   \n\u00a7 203(a), 56 Stat. 31.  An aggrieved party could then ap-\npeal to a special Article III court, called the Emergency \nCourt of Appeals.  \u00a7 204, 56 Stat. 31-33.  The EPCA \nvested the Emergency Court with \u201cexclusive jurisdic-\ntion to determine the validity\u201d of regulations, orders, \nand price schedules issued under the Act.  \u00a7 204(d), 56 \nStat. 33.  The statute also stated that, \u201c[e]xcept as pro-\nvided in [the EPCA], no court, Federal, State, or Terri-\ntorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the \nvalidity of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, \nor to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside, in whole or in \npart,  * * *  any provision of any such regulation, order, \nor price schedule.\u201d  Ibid. \nThis Court construed the EPCA\u2019s exclusivity provi-\nsion to bar other courts from determining the validity \nof covered orders in all types of litigation, including en-\nforcement suits.  In Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. \n414 (1944), the Court held that the statute divested dis-\ntrict courts of \u201cpower to consider the validity of a price \nregulation as a defense to a criminal prosecution for its \nviolation.\u201d  Id. at 429; see id. at 430.  The Court similarly \n\n20 \n \nfound \u201cno doubt\u201d that the EPCA barred a district court \n\u201cfrom determining the validity of [an] individual rent \norder\u201d in a civil enforcement suit against a landlord to \nrecover allegedly excessive rents, \u201ceven though the de-\nfense to the action brought there was based on the al-\nleged invalidity of the order.\u201d  Woods v. Hills, 334 U.S. \n210, 213-214 (1948). \nWhen language is \u201cobviously transplanted from an-\nother legal source, whether the common law or other \nlegislation, it brings the old soil with it.\u201d  Stokeling v. \nUnited States, 586 U.S. 73, 80 (2019) (citation omitted).  \nBy incorporating EPCA language that this Court had \nauthoritatively construed, Congress signaled its intent \nthat the Hobbs Act\u2019s grant of \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \n\u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of specified agency actions \nshould be understood in a like manner. \nb. Petitioner contends (Br. 34) that the old-soil prin-\nciple does not apply here because the EPCA contained \ntwo sentences regarding exclusivity, Yakus rested on \nboth of them together, and the Hobbs Act incorporates \nlanguage from only one of the sentences.  Those conten-\ntions are unsound. \nAs petitioner observes, the EPCA provided in two con-\nsecutive sentences (1) that the Emergency Court estab-\nlished by the Act \u201cshall have exclusive jurisdiction to  \ndetermine the validity\u201d of the covered agency actions and \n(2) that no other court \u201cshall have jurisdiction or power  \nto consider the validity of any such\u201d action.  \u00a7 204(d), 56 \nStat. 33.  In Yakus, this Court quoted the first sentence \nand observed that, \u201ccoupled\u201d with the second, the pro-\nvisions were \u201cbroad enough in terms to deprive the dis-\ntrict court of power to consider the validity of\u200a\u201d the chal-\nlenged regulation.  321 U.S. at 430.  But the Court\u2019s ob-\nservation that the two sentences together were \u201cbroad \n\n21 \n \nenough,\u201d ibid., does not suggest that either standing \nalone would have been insufficient.  Those sentences \nmerely stated two sides of the same coin:  One granted \nthe Emergency Court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction,\u201d and the \nother made explicit the necessary implication of that ex-\nclusivity for other modes of review.  EPCA \u00a7 204(d), 56 \nStat. 33.  Petitioner observes that the first sentence re-\nferred to \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d validity while the second re-\nferred to \u201cconsider[ing]\u201d validity.  Pet. Br. 34 (citations \nand emphasis omitted).  But this Court in Yakus did not \nsuggest any salient distinction between those terms, \nand petitioner does not identify one. \nPetitioner is also wrong to suggest (Br. 34) that the \nHobbs Act incorporates language only from the first \nEPCA sentence.  The second EPCA sentence (but not \nthe first) stated that no court other than the Emergency \nCourt could \u201cstay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside\u201d covered \nagency action.  EPCA \u00a7 204(d), 56 Stat. 33.  Congress \nincluded similar language in the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity \nprovision.  See 28 U.S.C. 2342.  Section 2342 thus incor-\nporates language from each of the two EPCA sentences \nthat the Yakus Court viewed as collectively precluding \ndistrict-court review. \nThe APA\u2019s text and history point in the same direc-\ntion.  As enacted in 1946, the APA stated that agency \naction \u201cshall be subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement except to \nthe extent that prior, adequate, and exclusive oppor-\ntunity for such review is provided by law.\u201d  \u00a7 10(b), 60 \nStat. 243; see 5 U.S.C. 703.  That provision is widely un-\nderstood to have been added to the APA \u201cto account for \nthe possible reappearance\u201d of judicial-review schemes \nsimilar to the EPCA\u2019s.  Paul R. Verkuil, Congressional \nLimitations on Judicial Review of Rules, 57 Tulane L. \n\n22 \n \nRev. 733, 741 n.34 (1983) (Verkuil) (citing U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act 99 (1947) (APA Manual)).  And \nin addressing the kind of preclusion that had been ac-\ncomplished by the EPCA and recognized in Yakus, Con-\ngress referred to laws that provide an \u201cexclusive oppor-\ntunity for [\u200ajudicial] review.\u201d  APA \u00a7 10(b), 60 Stat. 243. \nThat APA language harkens back to the first of the \nEPCA\u2019s exclusivity sentences rather than the second, \nwhich did not use the term \u201cexclusive.\u201d  Section 703 thus \nindicates that a law (like the Hobbs Act, see 28 U.S.C. \n2342) that designates some other mode of review as \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d will preclude \u201cjudicial review in civil or criminal \nproceedings for judicial enforcement.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 703.3 \nc. This Court likewise construed the pre-Hobbs Act \nscheme for judicial review of FCC orders as precluding \ncourts in suits between private parties from determin-\ning whether covered agency orders were lawful.  The \nUrgent Deficiencies Act (see pp. 2-3, supra) conferred \non specially constituted district courts \u201cexclusive juris-\ndiction\u201d over suits to \u201cenjoin, set aside, annul, or sus-\npend\u201d specified agency orders.  Act of June 18, 1910, ch. \n309, 36 Stat. 539-540 (vesting that jurisdiction in a spe-\ncial commerce court); see Urgent Deficiencies Act, 38 \nStat. 219-220 (abolishing the commerce court and trans-\nferring its jurisdiction to three-judge district courts); \nsee also 28 U.S.C. 44-48 (1934); Communications Act of \n1934, ch. 652, \u00a7 402(a), 48 Stat. 1093. \n \n3 Petitioner is wrong in suggesting (Br. 34-35) that the APA Man-\nual identified the second EPCA sentence as the key statutory lan-\nguage.  See APA Manual 99 & n.13 (stating that a \u201cstatute may  \n* * *  expressly provide for an exclusive method of judicial review \nwhich precludes challenge of agency action in enforcement proceed-\nings,\u201d and citing as an example \u201csection 204(d) of the [EPCA]\u201d). \n\n23 \n \nIn applying that exclusive-jurisdiction provision, this \nCourt focused on the practical effects of particular  \nsuits.  In Venner v. Michigan Central Railroad, 271 \nU.S. 127 (1926), the Court explained that a suit was sub-\nject to the exclusive-jurisdiction provision, even if it did \n\u201cnot expressly pray that [a covered] order be annulled \nor set aside,\u201d if the suit \u201cassail[ed] the validity of the \norder and pray[ed] that the defendant company be en-\njoined from doing what the order specifically author-\nizes, which is equivalent to asking that the order be ad-\njudged invalid and set aside.\u201d  Id. at 130.  Accordingly, \na shareholder in a railroad could not bring a suit against \nthe railroad outside the channels of Urgent Deficiencies \nAct review when the shareholder sought to enjoin the \nrailroad from carrying out an agreement that the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission (ICC) had approved.  Id. \nat 129.  In Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad, 258 U.S. 377 (1922), the Court similarly held \nthat a mining company\u2019s suit against a railroad to enjoin \nit from distributing coal cars constituted a suit to set \naside an ICC order that had already mandated the rel-\nevant coal-car schedule.  Id. at 381-382.  The Hobbs Act \nis best understood to operate with a similar focus on the \nsubstance of the suit, not just the relief requested.   \n4. The purpose and structure of the Hobbs Act confirm \nCongress\u2019s intent to preclude collateral attacks on \ncovered agency orders \nAdherence to the Hobbs Act\u2019s jurisdictional scheme \n\u201censure[s] that the Attorney General has an oppor-\ntunity to represent the interest of the Government \nwhenever an order of the specified agencies is re-\nviewed.\u201d  Transatlantic, 400 U.S. at 70; see 28 U.S.C. \n2344.  Here, as in Transatlantic, that aspect of the stat-\nutory design would be \u201cvitiate[d],\u201d 400 U.S. at 70, if par-\n\n24 \n \nties to private district-court litigation\u2014or, indeed, pri-\nvate litigation in the state courts\u2014could assert that cov-\nered agency orders are unlawful. \nPermitting such collateral challenges would under-\nmine the statutory scheme.  Many provisions governing \nHobbs Act review are designed to facilitate quick, na-\ntionwide resolution of disputes concerning the validity \nof covered agency actions.  These provisions establish a \n60-day filing deadline, mandate direct court-of-appeals \nreview, and provide for consolidation of multiple chal-\nlenges in a single court of appeals.  The court of appeals \ncan then consider the lawfulness of the agency action in \nlight of the administrative record, and often with the \nparticipation of the full range of stakeholders who were \ninvolved in the agency proceedings.  Taken together, \nthose procedures enable private entities, in structuring \ntheir operations, to act in reliance on an agency order \nonce a court of appeals has found it to be valid or the \ntime for seeking review has expired.   \nIn the TCPA context, the Hobbs Act ensures that \nbusinesses engaged in telemarketing can avoid liability \nin private TCPA suits by relying on safe harbors de-\nfined by the FCC.  Acceptance of petitioner\u2019s position \nwould render such safe harbors illusory.  Petitioner\u2019s \nown suit involves a Bureau order that is not presently a \nfinal order directly reviewable under the Hobbs Act.  \nSee pp. 10-11, supra.  But under petitioner\u2019s approach, \na regulated party could be held liable for conduct that a \nCommission order declares to be permissible under the \nTCPA, even after a court of appeals has upheld the per-\ntinent FCC order or the time for seeking Hobbs Act re-\nview has expired. \nPetitioner observes that under its interpretation the \nHobbs Act would still channel \u201cfacial, pre-enforcement \n\n25 \n \nchallenges\u201d to the courts of appeals.  Pet. Br. 25 (quoting \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 13 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring in the judgment)) (emphasis omitted).  Reading the \nAct to serve only that purpose would be a mistake.  Col-\nlateral attacks in enforcement actions, particularly  \nprivate suits, can likewise undermine the finality and \ncertainty that the Hobbs Act is designed to create\u2014 \nincluding for potential defendants who rely in good faith \non covered agency orders to structure their business af-\nfairs.  See Resp. Br. 33-35. \nC. Petitioner\u2019s Remaining Arguments Lack Merit \nPetitioner does not identify any presumptions, back-\nground rules, or substantive canons that would justify \nits narrow construction of the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity \nprovision. \n1. The question presented here does not implicate \nany \u201c\u200a\u2018strong presumption\u2019 favoring judicial review.\u201d  \nPet. Br. 28 (citation omitted).  The presumption that \n\u201cCongress intends judicial review of administrative ac-\ntion,\u201d Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physi-\ncians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986), comes into play only \nwhen one potential reading of a statute would insulate \nparticular agency action from all judicial review.  That \nis not the case here, since the Hobbs Act simply privi-\nleges one centralized forum for judicial review of cov-\nered agency actions.  And petitioner asks the Court to \ndecide this case on the understanding that petitioner \nhad a prior adequate opportunity to seek Hobbs Act re-\nview of the Board\u2019s Amerifactors order in a court of ap-\npeals.  See Pet. Cert. Reply Br. 4 (noting that petitioner \n\u201cnever argued that it lacked a prior or adequate oppor-\ntunity for review under the Hobbs Act\u201d).  Accordingly, \n\u201cthis case does not implicate \u2018the strong presumption \nthat Congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial re-\n\n26 \n \nview.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n207 n.8 (1994) (citations omitted).   \n2. Because the Hobbs Act \u201cprovide[s] by law\u201d for a \n\u201cprior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial \nreview\u201d of covered agency actions, 5 U.S.C. 703, Section \n703 by its terms indicates that such actions are not sub-\nject to review in enforcement proceedings.  The concept \nof \u201cadequacy\u201d in Section 703 derives from this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Yakus.  See pp. 19-21, supra (discussing Ya-\nkus); see also Verkuil 741 n.34 (explaining that Section \n703 \u201cincorporates the \u2018adequacy\u2019 standard of Yakus\u201d); \ncf. APA Manual 97-98 (observing that the \u201cadequate\u201d \nlimitation codified existing law).  The Court had held in \nYakus that foreclosing judicial review in enforcement \nproceedings does not violate due process as long as the \ndefendants had previously received an \u201cadequate\u201d op-\nportunity to challenge the relevant agency order.  321 \nU.S. at 434, 436-437.  Congress incorporated the same \nsafeguard, using the same term, when it enacted the \nAPA four years later.  APA \u00a7 10(b), 60 Stat. 243 (\u201cprior, \nadequate, and exclusive opportunity\u201d). \nAs Yakus illustrates, an exclusive review scheme may \nprovide an \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity for judicial review \neven where a particular litigant has failed to invoke that \nscheme.  See Yakus, 321 U.S. at 433-435 & n.3.  Peti-\ntioner\u2019s only proffered reason for reading Section 703 to \npreserve judicial review of covered FCC orders in pri-\nvate TCPA suits is that the Hobbs Act is \u201c\u200a\u2018exclusive\u2019\u200a\u201d of \ndistrict-court review only when the plaintiff seeks \u201c\u200a\u2018an \ninjunction or declaratory judgment regarding the \nagency\u2019s order\u2019 in a pre-enforcement facial challenge.\u201d  \nPet. Br. 29 n.5 (citations omitted).  If the Court rejects \nthat reading of the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusivity provision, \nthen Section 703 adds nothing to petitioner\u2019s arguments. \n\n27 \n \n3. Petitioner observes (Br. 31-32) that certain other \nagency-review statutes channel pre-enforcement chal-\nlenges to appellate courts while also permitting chal-\nlenges to be raised in enforcement suits.  But petitioner \ndoes not identify any example of such a statute that de-\nscribes the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction as \u201cexclusive.\u201d  \nPetitioner\u2019s discussion (Br. 32) of judicial review of \nrules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion does not fill that gap.  Contrary to petitioner\u2019s sug-\ngestion (ibid.), the Hobbs Act does not govern review of \nsuch rules, and the statute that does apply is worded \ndifferently.  See 15 U.S.C. 78y. \nPetitioner also invokes (Br. 32-33) other statutes \nthat more specifically foreclose collateral attacks on the \nvalidity of agency orders in enforcement litigation.  As \npetitioner points out, some provisions state that covered \nagency actions \u201cshall not be subject to judicial review in \nany civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 33 (quoting PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 14 (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment), in turn quot-\ning 33 U.S.C. 1369(b)(2)).  \u201cBut the mere possibility of \nclearer phrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading \nof a statute.\u201d  Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Novo \nNordisk A/S, 566 U.S. 399, 416 (2012).  Congress en-\nacted the Hobbs Act more than a decade before it en-\nacted any of those provisions.  Well before the Hobbs \nAct was enacted, moreover, the Court in Venner had \nheld that the Urgent Deficiencies Act\u2019s conferral of ex-\nclusive jurisdiction foreclosed collateral challenges in \nlitigation between private parties.  271 U.S. at 130; see \np. 23, supra.  The fact that more recent Congresses have \nforeclosed collateral challenges through differently \nworded provisions\u2014none of which includes the term \n\n28 \n \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d\u2014does not cast doubt on the \nproper interpretation of the Hobbs Act. \n4. Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Br. 35-37) on constitutional-\navoidance principles is also misplaced.  The rule that \nconstitutional difficulties should be avoided where pos-\nsible \u201cdoes not give a court the authority to rewrite a \nstatute,\u201d but simply permits a court to \u201c\u200a\u2018choose between \ncompeting plausible interpretations of a statutory \ntext.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 298 (2018) \n(brackets, citation, and emphasis omitted).  Given its \nlanguage, the history of its operative terms, and this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the Hobbs Act cannot plausibly be \nread to contain the limitation that petitioner advocates. \nIn any event, the reading of the Hobbs Act that the \nNinth Circuit adopted, and that respondents and the \ngovernment advocate here, raises no serious constitu-\ntional concern.  Due process \u201crequires the government \nto provide notice reasonably calculated, under all the \ncircumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pen-\ndency of the action and afford them an opportunity to \npresent their objections.\u201d  Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. \n220, 226 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Due process does not, however, require that \nlitigants be permitted to challenge an agency order at \nwhatever time, or in whatever forum, they prefer.  \nMoreover, litigants who wish to challenge a covered \nFCC order after the 60-day period for petitioning for \nHobbs Act review are not without recourse.  A person \nin those circumstances may petition the FCC for a new \ndeclaratory ruling, 47 C.F.R. 1.2, or ask the agency to \ninitiate a new rulemaking proceeding, 47 C.F.R. 1.401.  \nSee FCC v. ITT World Commc\u2019ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463, \n468 n.5 (1984); Any and All Radio Station, 207 F.3d at \n463; City of Peoria, 690 F.2d at 121. \n\n29 \n \nThe availability of judicial review also refutes peti-\ntioner\u2019s separation-of-powers argument (Br. 36-37).  \nThe Hobbs Act does not deny the federal judiciary the \npower to decide the legality of covered agency actions.  \nRather, the Act simply specifies review procedures to \npromote finality, uniformity, and judicial economy, and \nto ensure that orders are reviewed with the participa-\ntion of the government and on a developed administra-\ntive record.  \u201cThere is no constitutional requirement \nthat [a challenge] be made in one tribunal rather than \nin another, so long as there is an opportunity to be heard \nand for judicial review which satisfies the demands of \ndue process.\u201d  Yakus, 321 U.S. at 444; see United States \nv. Ruzicka, 329 U.S. 287, 292-294 (1946).  The separation \nof powers is likewise not offended when an Article III \ncourt is required to give preclusive effect to an agency\u2019s \nprior decision.  See B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis In-\ndus., Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 151 (2015). \nD. Amerifactors\u2019 Status As An Interpretation Of The TCPA \nDoes Not Render The Hobbs Act\u2019s Exclusive-Review \nProvision Inapplicable \nIn PDR Network, this Court remanded to allow the \ncourt of appeals to address, inter alia, whether the FCC \norder in that case should have been treated as the \n\u201cequivalent of an \u2018interpretive rule.\u2019\u200a\u201d  588 U.S. at 6-7.  \nThe Court viewed that inquiry as potentially bearing on \nthe \u201cextent to which the order binds the lower courts.\u201d  \nId. at 6.  Petitioner contends (Br. 37-42) that the Hobbs \nAct at least does not bar collateral attacks on interpre-\ntive rules or guidance, and that Amerifactors qualifies \nfor that putative \u201cinterpretive\u201d exception.  Those argu-\nments lack merit. \nThe interpretive/legislative distinction derives from \nthe APA\u2019s rulemaking requirements, which do not gov-\n\n30 \n \nern the promulgation of agency orders.  The APA ex-\nempts \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules from the notice, comment, \nand effective-date requirements for rulemaking under \n5 U.S.C. 553.  See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) and (d)(2).  The \nAPA does not use the term \u201clegislative rule,\u201d but that \nterm has come to describe rules that are not interpre-\ntative and therefore are ineligible for the notice-and-\ncomment exception.  See, e.g., Perez v. Mortgage Bank-\ners Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).  The APA prescribes \nseparate requirements and procedures for issuing an \nagency \u201corder,\u201d which by definition is the product of ad-\njudication rather than rulemaking.  See 5 U.S.C. 551(6) \nand (7) (defining \u201corder\u201d and \u201cadjudication\u201d). \nThe APA\u2019s adjudication provisions authorize agen-\ncies to issue \u201cdeclaratory order[s] to terminate a con-\ntroversy or remove uncertainty.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 554(e).  De-\nclaratory orders have \u201clike effect as in the case of other \norders.\u201d  Ibid.  They function similarly to declaratory \njudgments, allowing agencies to issue \u201cbinding rulings \ncapable of providing clear and certain guidance to reg-\nulated parties without requiring those parties to first \nact on peril of sanction.\u201d  Emily S. Bremer, Declaratory \nOrders: Final Report to the Administrative Conference \nof the United States 5 (Oct. 30, 2015).  The FCC\u2019s regu-\nlations specifically authorize the agency and its subor-\ndinate bureaus to issue such orders, which are known as \n\u201cdeclaratory rulings.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 1.2. \nHere, the Bureau issued Amerifactors in response to \na petition for a declaratory ruling, and the order states \nthat it is a \u201cdeclaratory ruling.\u201d  34 FCC Rcd at 11,950 \n\u00b6 3.  Petitioner identifies no reason to disregard that \ncharacterization.  Indeed, treating Amerifactors as an \norder rather than a rule was essential to an aspect of \nthe decision below that petitioner does not challenge:  It \n\n31 \n \nwas on that basis that the court of appeals treated \nAmerifactors as applying \u201cretroactively\u201d to faxes that \npredated the order.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIn any event, petitioner is wrong to suggest (Br. 39) \nthat the exclusivity of the Hobbs Act review mechanism \nturns on whether a particular agency action is better \ncharacterized as \u201cinterpretive\u201d or \u201clegislative.\u201d  As the \ngovernment acknowledged in PDR Network, that char-\nacterization may sometimes bear on whether a particu-\nlar agency action is reviewable in a court of appeals un-\nder the Hobbs Act scheme.  Oral Arg. Tr. 59, 64, PDR \nNetwork, supra (No. 17-1705); see, e.g., American \nTrucking Ass\u2019n v. United States, 755 F.2d 1292, 1296 \n(7th Cir. 1985) (agency report issued as an \u201ceducational \nundertaking\u201d was not subject to Hobbs Act review); cf. \nPet. Br. 41.  But the Hobbs Act does not otherwise pro-\nvide any \u201cexception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case law \ndoes not create one.\u201d  US West Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Ham-\nilton, 224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000); see, e.g., \nSorenson Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.3d 1215, 1223 \n(10th Cir. 2009) (Hobbs Act review of interpretive rule).  \nHere, petitioner specifically urged the Court to grant \ncertiorari and decide this case on the understanding \nthat Amerifactors could have been challenged in a court \nof appeals under the Hobbs Act review scheme.  See \nPet. Cert. Reply Br. 4.  When a particular agency action \nis reviewable by a court of appeals under the Hobbs Act, \nthe Act divests district courts of authority to \u201cdeter-\nmine [the action\u2019s] validity,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2342, regardless \nof whether the action is interpretive in character. \nPetitioner identifies no sound reason to except inter-\npretive rules from that exclusivity principle.  Even \napart from the absence of textual support for such an \nexception, the distinction between interpretive and leg-\n\n32 \n \nislative rules is not always easy to draw.  Cf. Mortgage \nBankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. at 96 (observing that the \u201cpre-\ncise meaning\u201d of the APA\u2019s reference to \u201cinterpretative \nrule[s]\u201d has been \u201cthe source of much scholarly and ju-\ndicial debate\u201d).  Petitioner suggests (Br. 40) that distin-\nguishing between the two types of rules is necessary to \navoid improperly giving interpretive rules the \u201cforce of \nlaw\u201d in district courts.  But to the extent the Hobbs Act \nprecludes a district court from finding an agency\u2019s in-\nterpretive rule to be unlawful, that bar is no different \nfrom requiring a district court to give preclusive effect \nto an agency adjudication, see, e.g., B&B Hardware, 575 \nU.S. at 148-149, or to reject an untimely challenge to an \nagency action.  Congress may limit the time and forum \nfor challenging an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, \nand the Hobbs Act imposes such limitations for agency \nactions covered by the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \naffirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \nP.

If no spe-\ncial statutory review proceeding is applicable, the action \nfor judicial review may be brought against the United \nStates, the agency by its official title, or the appropriate \nofficer.  Except to the extent that prior, adequate, and \nexclusive opportunity for judicial review is provided by \nlaw, agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement. \n \n2. \n5 U.S.C. 706 provides: \nScope of review \nTo the extent necessary to decision and when pre-\nsented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant \nquestions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory \nprovisions, and determine the meaning or applicability \nof the terms of an agency action.  The reviewing court \nshall\u2014 \n \n(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed; and \n \n(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be\u2014 \n\n2a \n \n \n(A) \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre-\ntion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; \n \n(B) \ncontrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity; \n \n(C) \nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, au-\nthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; \n \n(D) \nwithout observance of procedure re-\nquired by law; \n \n(E) \nunsupported by substantial evidence in a \ncase subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or \notherwise reviewed on the record of an agency \nhearing provided by statute; or \n \n(F) \nunwarranted by the facts to the extent \nthat the facts are subject to trial de novo by the \nreviewing court. \nIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall \nreview the whole record or those parts of it cited by a \nparty, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prej-\nudicial error. \n \n3. \n28 U.S.C. 2342 provides: \nJurisdiction of court of appeals \nThe court of appeals (other than the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) has exclusive \njurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in \npart), or to determine the validity of\u2014 \n \n(1) all final orders of the Federal Communica-\ntion Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) \nof title 47; \n\n3a \n \n \n(2) all final orders of the Secretary of Agricul-\nture made under chapters 9 and 20A of title 7, except \norders issued under sections 210(e), 217a, and \n499g(a) of title 7; \n \n(3) all rules, regulations, or final orders of\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe Secretary of Transportation issued \npursuant to section 50501, 50502, 56101-56104, or \n57109 of title 46 or pursuant to part B or C of sub-\ntitle IV, subchapter III of chapter 311, chapter \n313, or chapter 315 of title 49; and \n \n(B) \nthe Federal Maritime Commission issued \npursuant to section 305, 41304, 41308, or 41309 or \nchapter 421 or 441 of title 46; \n \n(4) all final orders of the Atomic Energy Com-\nmission made reviewable by section 2239 of title 42; \n \n(5) all rules, regulations, or final orders of the \nSurface Transportation Board made reviewable by \nsection 2321 of this title; \n \n(6) all final orders under section 812 of the Fair \nHousing Act; and \n \n(7) all final agency actions described in section \n20114(c) of title 49. \nJurisdiction is invoked by filing a petition as provided by \nsection 2344 of this title. \n \n \n \n\n4a \n \n4. \n28 U.S.C. 2344 provides:  \nReview of orders; time; notice; contents of petition; ser-\nvice \nOn the entry of a final order reviewable under this \nchapter, the agency shall promptly give notice thereof \nby service or publication in accordance with its rules. \nAny party aggrieved by the final order may, within 60 \ndays after its entry, file a petition to review the order in \nthe court of appeals wherein venue lies.  The action \nshall be against the United States.  The petition shall \ncontain a concise statement of\u2014 \n \n(1) the nature of the proceedings as to which re-\nview is sought; \n \n(2) the facts on which venue is based; \n \n(3) the grounds on which relief is sought; and \n \n(4) the relief prayed. \nThe petitioner shall attach to the petition, as exhibits, \ncopies of the order, report, or decision of the agency.  \nThe clerk shall serve a true copy of the petition on the \nagency and on the Attorney General by registered mail, \nwith request for a return receipt. \n \n5. \n28 U.S.C. 2348 provides: \nRepresentation in proceeding; intervention \nThe Attorney General is responsible for and has con-\ntrol of the interests of the Government in all court pro-\nceedings under this chapter.  The agency, and any \nparty in interest in the proceeding before the agency \nwhose interests will be affected if an order of the agency \n\n5a \n \nis or is not enjoined, set aside, or suspended, may appear \nas parties thereto of their own motion and as of right, \nand be represented by counsel in any proceeding to re-\nview the order.  Communities, associations, corpora-\ntions, firms, and individuals, whose interests are af-\nfected by the order of the agency, may intervene in any \nproceeding to review the order.  The Attorney General \nmay not dispose of or discontinue the proceeding to re-\nview over the objection of any party or intervenor, but \nany intervenor may prosecute, defend, or continue the \nproceeding unaffected by the action or inaction of the \nAttorney General. \n \n6. \n28 U.S.C. 2349(a) provides: \nJurisdiction of the proceeding \n(a) The court of appeals has jurisdiction of the pro-\nceeding on the filing and service of a petition to review.  \nThe court of appeals in which the record on review is \nfiled, on the filing, has jurisdiction to vacate stay orders \nor interlocutory injunctions previously granted by any \ncourt, and has exclusive jurisdiction to make and enter, \non the petition, evidence, and proceedings set forth in \nthe record on review, a judgment determining the valid-\nity of, and enjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in \nwhole or in part, the order of the agency. \n \n \n \n\n6a \n \n7. \n47 U.S.C. 155 provides in pertinent part: \nCommission \n*  *  *  *  * \n(c) \nDelegation of functions; exceptions to initial orders; \nforce, effect and enforcement of orders; administra-\ntive and judicial review; qualifications and compen-\nsation of delegates; assignment of cases; separation \nof review and investigative or prosecuting functions; \nsecretary; seal \n(1) When necessary to the proper functioning of the \nCommission and the prompt and orderly conduct of its \nbusiness, the Commission may, by published rule or by \norder, delegate any of its functions (except functions \ngranted to the Commission by this paragraph and by \nparagraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection and except \nany action referred to in sections 204(a)(2), 208(b), and \n405(b) of this title) to a panel of commissioners, an indi-\nvidual commissioner, an employee board, or an individ-\nual employee, including functions with respect to hear-\ning, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, or oth-\nerwise acting as to any work, business, or matter; except \nthat in delegating review functions to employees in \ncases of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5), \nthe delegation in any such case may be made only to an \nemployee board consisting of two or more employees re-\nferred to in paragraph (8) of this subsection.  Any such \nrule or order may be adopted, amended, or rescinded \nonly by a vote of a majority of the members of the Com-\nmission then holding office.  Except for cases involving \nthe authorization of service in the instructional televi-\nsion fixed service, or as otherwise provided in this chap-\nter, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Com-\n\n7a \n \nmission to provide for the conduct, by any person or per-\nsons other than persons referred to in paragraph (2) or \n(3) of section 556(b) of title 5, of any hearing to which \nsuch section applies. \n*  *  *  *  * \n(3) Any order, decision, report, or action made or \ntaken pursuant to any such delegation, unless reviewed \nas provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, shall \nhave the same force and effect, and shall be made, evi-\ndenced, and enforced in the same manner, as orders, de-\ncisions, reports, or other actions of the Commission. \n(4) Any person aggrieved by any such order, deci-\nsion, report or action may file an application for review \nby the Commission within such time and in such manner \nas the Commission shall prescribe, and every such ap-\nplication shall be passed upon by the Commission.  The \nCommission, on its own initiative, may review in whole \nor in part, at such time and in such manner as it shall \ndetermine, any order, decision, report, or action made \nor taken pursuant to any delegation under paragraph (1) \nof this subsection. \n(5) In passing upon applications for review, the \nCommission may grant, in whole or in part, or deny such \napplications without specifying any reasons therefor.  \nNo such application for review shall rely on questions of \nfact or law upon which the panel of commissioners, indi-\nvidual commissioner, employee board, or individual em-\nployee has been afforded no opportunity to pass. \n(6) If the Commission grants the application for re-\nview, it may affirm, modify, or set aside the order, deci-\nsion, report, or action, or it may order a rehearing upon \n\n8a \n \nsuch order, decision, report, or action in accordance with \nsection 405 of this title. \n(7) The filing of an application for review under this \nsubsection shall be a condition precedent to judicial re-\nview of any order, decision, report, or action made or \ntaken pursuant to a delegation under paragraph (1) of \nthis subsection.  The time within which a petition for \nreview must be filed in a proceeding to which section \n402(a) of this title applies, or within which an appeal \nmust be taken under section 402(b) of this title, shall be \ncomputed from the date upon which public notice is \ngiven of orders disposing of all applications for review \nfiled in any case. \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n8. \n47 U.S.C. 227 provides in pertinent part: \nRestrictions on use of telephone equipment \n(a) \nDefinitions \nAs used in this section\u2014 \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n(3) The term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \nmeans equipment which has the capacity (A) to tran-\nscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or im-\nages (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper. \n*  *  *  *  * \n\n9a \n \n(b) \nRestrictions on use of automated telephone equip-\nment \n(1) Prohibitions \n \nIt shall be unlawful for any person within the \nUnited States, or any person outside the United \nStates if the recipient is within the United States\u2014 \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n(C) \nto use any telephone facsimile machine, \ncomputer, or other device to send, to a telephone \nfacsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement, \nunless\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthe unsolicited advertisement is from a \nsender with an established business relation-\nship with the recipient; \n \n(ii) the sender obtained the number of the \ntelephone facsimile machine through\u2014 \n \n(I) \nthe voluntary communication of such \nnumber, within the context of such estab-\nlished business relationship, from the recip-\nient of the unsolicited advertisement, or \n \n(II) a directory, advertisement, or site on \nthe Internet to which the recipient voluntar-\nily agreed to make available its facsimile \nnumber for public distribution, \nexcept that this clause shall not apply in the \ncase of an unsolicited advertisement that is \nsent based on an established business relation-\nship with the recipient that was in existence be-\nfore July 9, 2005, if the sender possessed the \n\n10a \n \nfacsimile machine number of the recipient be-\nfore July 9, 2005; and \n \n(iii) the unsolicited advertisement contains \na notice meeting the requirements under para-\ngraph (2)(D), \nexcept that the exception under clauses (i) and (ii) \nshall not apply with respect to an unsolicited ad-\nvertisement sent to a telephone facsimile machine \nby a sender to whom a request has been made not \nto send future unsolicited advertisements to such \ntelephone facsimile machine that complies with \nthe requirements under paragraph (2)(E); or \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n9. \n47 U.S.C. 402(a) provides: \nJudicial review of Commission\u2019s orders and decisions \n(a) \nProcedure \nAny proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or sus-\npend any order of the Commission under this chapter \n(except those appealable under subsection (b) of this \nsection) shall be brought as provided by and in the man-\nner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28. \n \n \n \n\n11a \n \n10.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation resulted from a search for the respondent's (McKesson's) merits brief. However, the search returned the Brief in Opposition (BIO) filed on August 5, 2024. As this is the same document that formed the basis of the previous belief update, no new task-specific information has been acquired. Consequently, my beliefs about the case's trajectory, the parties' arguments, and the likely outcomes remain stable, pending the filing of the actual merits briefs or the Solicitor General's brief. My current understanding, solidified by the BIO, is as follows:\n\n*   **Stable Core Conflict & The *PDR Network* Shadow (Confirmed):** The case continues to revolve around the Hobbs Act jurisdictional question left open in ***PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.*** The BIO confirmed that McKesson's primary strategy is not to engage directly on the Hobbs Act question but to frame the case as a \"poor vehicle.\" McKesson's key distinction\u2014that this case involves a *plaintiff* (McLaughlin) collaterally attacking an agency order to *create* liability, unlike the *defendant* in *PDR Network* who attacked an order to *defend* against liability\u2014remains their central tool for neutralizing the due process concerns that animated the *PDR Network* concurrences.\n\n*   **Competing Arguments (Concrete & Stable):** The arguments for both sides are now well-defined, based on the petition and the BIO.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):**\n        1.  **Primary:** The Hobbs Act's exclusive-jurisdiction provision does not prevent a district court from interpreting a statute in a private damages case.\n        2.  **Fallback:** The FCC order is a non-binding \"interpretive rule.\"\n    *   **Respondent's Position (Established from BIO):**\n        1.  **Primary (Vehicular/Procedural):** The case is a poor vehicle because: (a) the plaintiff-challenger posture is different from *PDR Network*; (b) the underlying FCC order (*Amerifactors*) is not final as it's still under agency review; and (c) petitioner is procedurally barred for failing to seek direct review of the FCC order.\n        2.  **Rebuttal to Fallback:** The FCC order is an *adjudication*, not an interpretive rule, making the petitioner's fallback argument inapplicable.\n        3.  **Alternative Merits Ground:** The Court should affirm based on the TCPA's plain text, arguing that the statute's definition of a \"telephone facsimile machine\" (requiring the capacity to \"transcribe...onto paper\") does not cover the online fax services used, thus avoiding the Hobbs Act question entirely.\n\n*   **Assessment of \"Off-Ramps\" (Stable & Significant):** The BIO's introduction of multiple, plausible off-ramps remains the most significant strategic development. These provide the Court with numerous ways to decide the case narrowly in McKesson's favor without resolving the core Hobbs Act question.\n    *   **The \"Interpretive Rule\" Off-Ramp (Contested):** Petitioner's path to a narrow win is complicated by McKesson's counter-characterization of the FCC order as an adjudication.\n    *   **The \"Statutory Interpretation\" Off-Ramp (Prominently Featured):** McKesson continues to heavily promote this minimalist path, which allows the Court to rule that the TCPA simply doesn't apply to the technology at issue.\n    *   **The Procedural Off-Ramps (Newly Introduced by BIO):** The arguments based on ripeness (ongoing agency review) and preclusion (failure to exhaust) offer the Court additional, non-merits-based exits.\n\n*   **Prediction & Confidence (Unchanged):** My confidence level and prediction are unchanged. The case is highly competitive, but the array of plausible off-ramps presented by McKesson increases the probability of an affirmance for them, or a dismissal. A victory for McLaughlin requires the Court to navigate past all of these alternative grounds to reach and agree with their primary Hobbs Act argument. The potential outcomes remain:\n    1.  **Reversal (Broad):** Agreeing with petitioner on the Hobbs Act.\n    2.  **Reversal (Narrow):** Agreeing the FCC order is an interpretive rule.\n    3.  **Affirmance (Hobbs Act):** Agreeing with the Ninth Circuit's collateral attack reasoning.\n    4.  **Affirmance (Alternative Statutory Grounds):** Ruling the TCPA's text doesn't cover the conduct. (Probability of this outcome remains elevated since the BIO analysis).\n    5.  **Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) / Vacatur:** Dismissing due to the vehicular problems raised by McKesson. (Remains a distinct possibility).\n\n*   **Remaining Uncertainty (Unchanged):** The most critical missing information is still the respondent's full merits brief and the brief from the Solicitor General. My uncertainty is not *what* McKesson will argue\u2014the BIO has laid that bare\u2014but *how* the Court will react to their strategy of deflection and the viability of the numerous off-ramps. The SG's brief will be a crucial signal, indicating the government's stance on the jurisdictional question, the procedural bars, and the alternative statutory interpretation.",

It correctly identifies that the SG's support makes an affirmance for the respondent the most probable result. More importantly, it refines the nature of the remaining uncertainty: the key question is no longer *who* will win, but *how* the Court will rule (a broad merits decision on the Hobbs Act vs. a narrow procedural dismissal based on the non-finality of the FCC order). By pinpointing the petitioner's reply brief as the key to resolving this specific uncertainty, the action sharpens the predictive model and clarifies the exact information needed next.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action demonstrates a highly generalizable and effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction. It models the importance of tracking the 'dialogue' of briefing, showing that after a major argument is introduced (especially by the SG), the most informative next step is to observe the opposing party's direct response. It also identifies a sophisticated and recurring strategic pattern: the SG offering the Court a way to 'correct the premise' of a case, providing a merits-based path forward while acknowledging a procedural flaw.

However, it also introduces a new, crucial wrinkle: the SG contends that the underlying FCC order (*Amerifactors*) is not actually a 'final order' subject to the Hobbs Act because an application for review is still pending before the full Commission. The SG suggests the Court should decide the main legal question anyway, but this provides the Court a clear 'off-ramp' to dismiss the case as improvidently granted or vacate and remand without setting a broad precedent. The key remaining uncertainty is how the petitioner, McLaughlin, responds to these powerful new arguments from the U.S. government. Their final chance to do so is in their reply brief. This document will reveal whether they have a plausible counter to the SG's two-pronged attack (the main Hobbs Act argument and the 'non-finality' off-ramp). Finding and analyzing the petitioner's reply brief is the most important next step to resolve the remaining uncertainty about how the Court will navigate these options."

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, filed by the Solicitor General (SG) in support of the Respondents (McKesson). This is a highly consequential development, as the SG's views carry significant weight with the Court. The brief fundamentally alters the landscape of the case, solidifying the arguments for affirmance while introducing a critical new legal nuance.\n\n*   **New Core Information & Shift in Probabilities (Major Update):** The United States government has officially sided with McKesson. The SG argues that the Hobbs Act's exclusive jurisdiction provision *does* bar collateral attacks on covered agency orders in district court. This strong endorsement from the executive branch, which has a deep interest in the uniform application of administrative law, dramatically increases the probability of an affirmance. A victory for the petitioner, McLaughlin, now requires the Court to reject not only the Ninth Circuit's reasoning but also the formal position of the U.S. government.\n\n*   **The SG's \"Correct-the-Premise\" Strategy (New Argument):** The SG's brief introduces a sophisticated and surprising argument. In Section A, \"The decision below rests on an incorrect premise,\" the SG asserts that the specific FCC order at issue, *Amerifactors*, is **not a final, reviewable order** to which the Hobbs Act applies. This is because it was issued by a subordinate FCC Bureau, and an application for review by the full Commission remains pending. The SG states that disposition by the full Commission is a \"condition precedent to judicial review\" under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).\n    *   **Strategic Implication:** The SG is not using this point to suggest the case should be dismissed. Instead, the SG argues that the Court should *assume* the order is final for the sake of argument, answer the broader legal question presented in McKesson's favor, and affirm the judgment on that corrected legal basis. This provides the Court a path to set a clear, broad precedent on the Hobbs Act's preclusive effect, which is the government's primary interest, while acknowledging the procedural peculiarity of this specific case.\n\n*   **Reinforcement of the Core Hobbs Act Argument (Confirmed & Strengthened):** The SG's brief provides a comprehensive and powerful defense of the Hobbs Act's preclusive power, moving it from a contested issue to the central, government-endorsed position. The SG argues this based on:\n    1.  **Plain Language:** \"Exclusive jurisdiction\" in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 means what it says, precluding district court review.\n    2.  **Precedent:** Cites key cases like ***Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass'n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic*** and ***Yakus v. United States*** to show a consistent history of barring such collateral attacks.\n    3.  **History and Purpose:** The statutory scheme was designed to ensure prompt, uniform, and conclusive judicial review of agency orders, a purpose that would be defeated by allowing piecemeal challenges in district courts.\n\n*   **Re-evaluation of \"Off-Ramps\" (Shifted Focus):** The SG's brief largely ignores the \"off-ramps\" previously identified in McKesson's BIO, such as the alternative statutory interpretation of the TCPA. The focus is squarely on the jurisdictional Hobbs Act question. The non-finality of the *Amerifactors* order now presents the most plausible \"off-ramp,\" but one the SG itself discourages the Court from taking. The Court could, however, still use this non-finality issue to dismiss the case as improvidently granted (DIG) or vacate and remand, finding the entire dispute premature.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Significantly Weakened):** The SG's brief directly attacks and weakens McLaughlin's key arguments.\n    *   **Fallback Argument Neutralized:** The SG explicitly argues (in Section D) that the *Amerifactors* order's status as an \"interpretation\" of the TCPA does not make the Hobbs Act's exclusive-review provision inapplicable. This substantially undermines what was previously the petitioner's most likely path to a narrow victory.\n\n*   **Prediction & Confidence (Increased Confidence in Affirmance):** My confidence has shifted significantly in favor of an outcome for the respondent, McKesson. The SG's support is a powerful signal. The path to reversal for the petitioner has become exceptionally narrow. The likely outcomes are now weighted as follows:\n    1.  **Affirmance (Broad):** The Court adopts the SG's reasoning, holding that the Hobbs Act bars collateral attacks on final agency orders, thereby affirming the Ninth Circuit's judgment in principle. This is now the most probable outcome.\n    2.  **Dismissal/Vacatur (Narrow):** The Court seizes on the SG's point that the *Amerifactors* order is not final and either dismisses the writ as improvidently granted or vacates the lower court judgment and remands, thereby avoiding a decision on the merits of the Hobbs Act question. The probability of this outcome has increased.\n    3.  **Reversal (for Petitioner):** A reversal for McLaughlin now seems highly unlikely, as it would require the Court to disagree with the Ninth Circuit, the respondent, and the Solicitor General on the fundamental operation of the Hobbs Act.\n\n*   **Remaining Uncertainty (Refined):** The primary uncertainty is no longer *if* the Court will favor the respondent's position, but *how*. The key question is whether the Court will follow the SG's advice to issue a broad ruling on the Hobbs Act question or use the non-finality of the *Amerifactors* order as a vehicle for a narrower, case-specific disposition. The Court's choice will determine the precedential impact of the decision.",

This observation does not introduce new external evidence, facts, or signals about the case itself.

As a result, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are centered on the significant impact of the SG's brief.\n\n*   **Stable Core Belief:** The U.S. government, via the Solicitor General's amicus brief, has strongly endorsed the respondent's (McKesson's) position. The SG argues that the Hobbs Act's exclusive jurisdiction provision (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342) bars collateral attacks on covered agency orders in district courts. This support from the executive branch makes an affirmance of the Ninth Circuit's decision the most probable outcome.\n\n*   **Stable Key Nuance:** The SG's brief introduced a critical procedural wrinkle by arguing that the specific FCC order at issue (*Amerifactors*) may not be a \"final, reviewable order\" under the Hobbs Act because an application for review by the full Commission is still pending (per 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7)). This argument, while presented as a reason to \"correct the premise\" rather than dismiss, provides the Court with a clear procedural \"off-ramp.\"\n\n*   **Stable Evaluation of Arguments:**\n    *   **Respondent's Position (Strengthened):** McKesson's core argument about Hobbs Act preclusion is now bolstered by the SG's detailed analysis of statutory text, purpose, and precedent (e.g., *Port of Boston*, *Yakus*).\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Weakened):** McLaughlin's arguments are significantly undermined. The SG's brief directly refutes the idea that an order's status as an \"interpretation\" makes the Hobbs Act inapplicable, neutralizing the petitioner's most plausible fallback argument.\n\n*   **Stable Prediction & Confidence:** My confidence remains high that the outcome will favor the respondent. The probability distribution of outcomes is unchanged:\n    1.  **Affirmance (Broad):** Most likely outcome. The Court agrees with the SG and the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the Hobbs Act question.\n    2.  **Dismissal/Vacatur (Narrow):** Second most likely.

The Solicitor General's argument that the Hobbs Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342) precludes district courts from hearing collateral attacks on FCC orders strongly supports the respondent, McKesson. This endorsement from the executive branch makes an affirmance of the Ninth Circuit's decision the most probable outcome.\n\n*   **Stable Key Nuance:** The Solicitor General's brief provides the Court with a procedural \"off-ramp\" by questioning the finality of the underlying FCC order (*Amerifactors*). The SG noted that an application for review of that order is pending before the full Commission (per 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7)), which may mean it is not a \"final, reviewable order\" under the Hobbs Act.

The SG's brief directly counters the petitioner's central claim that the Hobbs Act does not apply to \"interpretive\" orders, thereby neutralizing their most compelling argument.\n\n*   **Stable Prediction & Confidence:** My confidence remains high that the Court's decision will favor the respondent. The probability distribution of potential outcomes is unchanged:\n    1.  **Affirmance (Broad Merits Ruling):** The most likely outcome. The Court adopts the reasoning of the SG and the Ninth Circuit on the preclusive effect of the Hobbs Act.\n    2.  **Dismissal/Vacatur (Narrow Procedural Ruling):** The second most likely outcome.

Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc., 588 \nU.S. 1 (2019): Does the Hobbs Act require a district court \nto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA? \nThe respondents do not deny that this is an important \nand recurring question of federal law on which the circuits \nare divided\u2014just as it was when the Court granted review \nin PDR Network. Nor do they deny that the Ninth Circuit \nbelow applied its controlling precedent on this question \nand held that the district court \u201ccorrectly found that it was \nbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA. \nPet. App. 7a. And, importantly, the respondents do not \ncontend that either of the \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that \nultimately frustrated resolution of the question presented \nin PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 4, will do the same here. \nNevertheless, the respondents spend 36 pages trying \nto convince the Court that it should pass up the chance to \nfinally resolve this important question and the split that it \nhas caused. Their arguments pose no barrier to review.   \nA. The respondents first argue (at 13\u201316) that there is \nno \u201cpost-PDR Network split about interpretive rules,\u201d \nand that deciding the question that this Court intended to \ndecide five years ago would be \u201cpremature.\u201d But the \npetition asks the Court to resolve the circuit split on the \nquestion presented, which goes well beyond interpretive \nrules. That split prompted the Court to grant certiorari in \nPDR Network, and it still exists today. Nor does it matter \nwhether the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order is properly \nclassified as the equivalent of an interpretive rule (as the \nrespondents argued below). What matters is that, as the \ndistrict court below recognized, controlling Ninth Circuit \nprecedent treats the Amerifactors order as binding under \n\n- 2 - \n \nthe Hobbs Act regardless of how it\u2019s characterized. So the \nfirst preliminary issue identified in PDR Network stands \nas no obstacle to reaching the question presented here. \nNor would it be premature for the Court to decide that \nquestion now. The issue was ripe in 2018, when the Court \ngranted certiorari in PDR Network. And since then, the \nneed for authoritative resolution has only grown. Within \nmonths of this Court\u2019s decision declining to resolve the \nsplit, a full panel of the Eleventh Circuit called on that \ncourt \u201cto correct [its] mistake en banc\u201d \u201cin the earliest \nappropriate case.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., \nLP, 931 F.3d 1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But neither that court nor the Ninth Circuit \nin this case has done so. As a result, the pre-PDR Network \nsplit is alive and well. It now falls to this Court to bring \nneeded uniformity to the law on this important question. \nB. The respondents then turn to the merits (at 16\u201326). \nThe argue that the answer to the question presented is \nyes\u2014the Hobbs Act requires a district court in an as-\napplied enforcement proceeding to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA. That is so, they say, because \notherwise the court would have to \u201cdetermine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018sound [or] good,\u2019\u201d which the \nHobbs Act (in their view) prevents it from doing. BIO 17. \nThis argument was squarely rejected by four Justices in \nPDR Network, and the question to be resolved here will \nbe whether their reading of the Hobbs Act is correct. The \npetitioner says it is; the respondents say it\u2019s not. The point \nof plenary review will be to determine who\u2019s right. \nYet the bulk of the respondents\u2019 merits section is not \nabout the text of the Hobbs Act\u2014or even about the Hobbs \nAct at all. It is instead about whether the FCC was right \nto interpret the TCPA the way that it did. See BIO 21\u201326. \nBut that issue, which the Ninth Circuit did not reach, will \n\n- 3 - \n \nbe an issue for a lower court on remand. It has nothing to \ndo with the question presented and will not \u201cprevent the \nCourt from deciding the question presented.\u201d Contra BIO \n34. The question presented is whether a district court is \nbarred from even conducting a statutory analysis, not who \nwill prevail here should the court be permitted to do so.   \nC. Finally, the respondents make a vehicle argument. \nSee BIO 27\u201335. They claim that there are two distinctions \nbetween this case and PDR Network that make this case \nan unsuitable replacement for PDR Network. The most \n\u201cfundamental difference,\u201d in their eyes (at 17), is that in \nPDR Network, the party arguing that the Hobbs Act does \nnot require a district court to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA was the defendant, whereas \nhere it\u2019s the plaintiff. The respondents contend that this \nCourt \u201cshould await a case in which a defendant questions \nthe statutory interpretation in an FCC order.\u201d BIO 3.  \nBut the question presented is about the meaning of a \nstatute. And the Hobbs Act contains no hint that it means \nsomething different depending on which party is invoking \nit. Either the statute requires a district court to adhere to \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in an enforcement \naction or it does not. But the answer will not be different \ndepending on who happens to benefit from the FCC order. \nNor did Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, suggest any such reading of the statute. To the \ncontrary, his reading applies to plaintiffs and defendants \nalike. See 588 U.S. at 27 (\u201cIn an as-applied enforcement \naction, the district court should interpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). Although his opinion often \nframes the issue from the vantage point of a TCPA \ndefendant, it does so because that was the posture of that \ncase\u2014not because its textual analysis is reserved solely \n\n- 4 - \n \nfor the benefit of defendants. Contra BIO 18\u201319; see also \nGorss, 931 F.3d at 1109 (Pryor, J., concurring) (observing \nthat a \u201cstark implication[] of our misconstruction of the \nHobbs Act\u201d is that \u201ca plaintiff with a viable claim under \nthe law Congress enacted may be unable to pursue it \nsimply because an agency has misinterpreted the law in \nan order to which he was a not a party\u201d). No circuit, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit, has drawn any such atextual \ndistinction. Indeed, not even the respondents argue that \nthe statute\u2019s text could mean one thing for defendants and \nanother for plaintiffs. They simply disagree with Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s textual analysis, thus underscoring the \nappropriateness of this case as a vehicle. \nThe respondents also try to make something of the fact \nthat the FCC order in PDR Network predated that case \nby many years, whereas this case was filed six years \nbefore the Amerifactors order. That distinction, however, \nhas no bearing on the question presented. Unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \nprior or adequate opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct, which was the second preliminary issue noted in this \nCourt\u2019s opinion. So this difference, if anything, makes this \ncase a better vehicle than PDR Network, not a worse one. \nNor is there any realistic possibility that FCC action \nwill affect this Court\u2019s review. The respondents speculate \n(at 28) that the FCC could thwart review by acting on a \nfour-year-old application and reversing the Amerifactors \norder. But the respondents give no reason to think that \nthis will actually happen, and the theoretical possibility \nthat an agency could later change its mind is no reason for \nthis Court to stay its hand when the agency action is \ncausing real harm to real people. And here, not only is \nthere no deadline for the FCC to act, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4), \nbut the respondents point to no example of the FCC ever \n\n- 5 - \n \noverturning an interpretation that had been reached on \ndelegated authority, much less doing so without first \nengaging in notice and comment. Far from offering a \nreason why the FCC will reverse course, the respondents \ndo the opposite: They say that the order represents the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment\u201d and is \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d correct. \nBIO 26, 34. Again, if the respondents are right about what \nthe TCPA means, they should prevail on the merits on \nremand\u2014but only because a court reached that \nconclusion, not because an agency did so.  \nAs for the respondents\u2019 argument that the petitioner \nshould be bound by the FCC\u2019s order under \u201cnormal \npreclusion principles,\u201d BIO 32, that argument is even \nmore off-base. It is wrong, independent of the question \npresented, and waived to boot. The petitioner was entitled \nto make its statutory arguments\u2014and to continue seeking \nas-applied relief\u2014in the same case that it had been \nlitigating for six years before the FCC order. It was not \nrequired to halt that litigation and pursue the \u201cconvoluted \nroute\u201d of Hobbs Act review. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 25 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But that\u2019s an argument that \ncan be dealt with by the Ninth Circuit on remand, along \nwith the question of whether the respondents have even \npreserved the issue. It is not an impediment to this Court\u2019s \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \n The petition for certiorari should be granted. \n\n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n       Respectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

No. 81-2618 (1950) .................................................. 13 \n \n\n \n-1- \nINTRODUCTION \nMcKesson asks this Court to adopt a strikingly broad \nreading of the Hobbs Act\u2014one that would strip the \nfederal courts (including this Court) of jurisdiction in \nprivate enforcement actions to second-guess an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute. Nobody questions that the \nHobbs Act\u2019s grant of \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d is designed \nto funnel facial, pre-enforcement challenges to agency \nactions into the courts of appeals. No matter how the \nCourt resolves this case, those challenges will continue. \nBut McKesson\u2019s construction would extend that exclusive \njurisdiction to include garden-variety civil litigation \nbetween private parties in district court. If Congress \nreally wanted to deprive courts of jurisdiction to question \nagencies\u2019 reading of statutes in such cases, it knew how to \ndo so. See, e.g., 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1). That Congress \ndidn\u2019t use comparable language here is strong evidence \nthat it had no such intent.  \nAlthough McKesson barely acknowledges it, four \njustices have already squarely rejected its far-reaching \nposition. See PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, 588 U.S. 1, 9 (2019) (Thomas, J., \nconcurring); id. at 12 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). And for \ngood reason: That reading, which relies primarily on \ndictionary definitions at the expense of context, fails to \nplausibly account for the statute\u2019s plain meaning and \nsurrounding text (much of which it would render \nsuperfluous), ignores the statute\u2019s history, and raises \nserious constitutional problems. Neither McKesson nor \nthe government\u2014which recycles its arguments nearly \n\n \n-2- \nverbatim from PDR Network\u2014comes up with convincing \nanswers to these problems.1 \nEven if the Hobbs Act did foreclose a district court\u2019s \nreview of an agency\u2019s legislative rules (which have the \nforce of law), the Ninth Circuit was still wrong to apply \nthat limit to the FCC\u2019s interpretive (and thus non-binding) \norder here. Both parties agreed below that the agency\u2019s \nAmerifactors order is interpretive because, rather than \ncreating new rules or standards of conduct, it serves \nprimarily to advise the public about the agency\u2019s \nconstruction of the statute it administers. Because this \nkind of interpretive rule lacks the force of law, it can never \nbind parties and courts\u2014whether or not the Hobbs Act\u2019s \nexclusive jurisdiction applies. \nAs this Court recently reaffirmed in Loper Bright \nEnterprises v. Raimondo, the \u201cinterpretation of the \nmeaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable contro-\nversies,\u201d is \u201cexclusively a judicial function.\u201d 603 U.S. 369, \n387 (2024). The approach pushed by McKesson and the \ngovernment, however, would require courts to afford \u201cnot \nmere Skidmore deference or Chevron deference, but \nabsolute deference\u201d to agencies for all manner of informal \nand otherwise non-binding interpretive rules and \nguidance documents\u2014\u201cno matter how wrong the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation might be.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). That would threaten a \n\u201cproposition reflected by judicial practice dating back to \nMarbury: that courts decide legal questions by applying \ntheir own judgment.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 391. \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted, all internal quotation marks, citations, \nand alterations have been omitted from quotations.  \n\n \n-3- \nTo avoid the many serious problems caused by \nMcKesson\u2019s rule, this Court should read the Hobbs Act as \nwhat it is: a commonplace jurisdictional statute designed \nto allow parties to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief \nagainst agencies in the courts of appeals; not a mandate \nfor judicial \u201cabdication\u201d to federal agencies. PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Hobbs Act does not forbid the federal courts \nfrom disagreeing with an agency\u2019s interpretation \nof a statute in a private enforcement suit. \nA. The Hobbs Act\u2019s plain language limits the \nAct\u2019s coverage to actions for declaratory or \ninjunctive relief. \nOur opening brief explains why \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of,\u201d as used in the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, is \nbest read as an authorization for the courts of appeals to \nissue declaratory judgments on covered agency orders\u2014\njust as it authorizes them to issue other forms of equitable \nrelief. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cvalid\u201d includes \n\u201chaving legal force; effective or binding.\u201d American \nHeritage Dictionary (4th ed. 2006). To \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d an order under this reading thus means to \ndetermine whether the order is legally in effect. And the \nHobbs Act requires the courts of appeals to make this \ndetermination in a \u201cjudgment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2349(a). As \nJustice Kavanaugh explained in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, a court can do that \u201conly by entering a \ndeclaratory judgment that the order is valid or invalid.\u201d \n588 U.S. at 21. That\u2019s the mechanism that courts routinely \nuse to \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d statutes and regulations. \nRy. Mail Ass\u2019n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 91 (1945) (noting that \n\n \n-4- \nthe plaintiff sought \u201ca declaratory judgment to determine \nthe validity of\u201d a statute).2 \nMcKesson cannot deny that this reading is consistent \nwith the plain meaning of \u201cdeclare the validity.\u201d As the \ngovernment correctly notes (at 13): \u201cEntering a judgment \ndeclaring an agency action to be invalid (or valid) is surely \none means of determining the validity of that action.\u201d \nInstead, McKesson offers an alternative (and much \nbroader) definition of the phrase that would extend to any \n\u201cdecision on whether the agency order was correct, \nregardless of the relief sought.\u201d McKesson Br. 12; see also \nU.S. Br. 12 (arguing that the phrase covers decisions on \nwhether an order is \u201cgrounded\u201d in \u201csound principles\u201d). It \nnever argues, however, that this interpretation is the only \npossible reading. See McKesson Br. 12 (calling its \npreferred definition \u201ca common, ordinary meaning of \u2018to \ndetermine the validity\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)). Dictionaries \nequally support our reading as an alternative definition of \n\u201cvalid.\u201d See Br. 21; U.S. Br. 12. Because there are thus at \nleast \u201ctwo grammatically permissible ways\u201d to read \n\u201cdetermine the validity of,\u201d the Court must resolve the \nconflict \u201cby reviewing [the] text in context.\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 133 (2024). \n \n2 The government makes a preliminary suggestion (at 10-12) that \nthe Ninth Circuit \u201cerred in treating\u201d the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order \nas a \u201cfinal order\u201d covered by the Hobbs Act. Although we don\u2019t \ndisagree, this Court granted certiorari on the premise that the order \nwas final\u2014just as it did in PDR Network. See 588 U.S. at 6 \n(\u201cassum[ing] without deciding\u201d that the FCC action was \u201ca \u2018final \norder\u2019\u201d under the Hobbs Act). As the government itself acknowledges \n(at 11-12), the Court therefore \u201cmay assume for purposes of this case \nthat the Amerifactors order is covered.\u201d  \n\n \n-5- \nB. The surrounding language of section 2342 \nfurther fixes the Act\u2019s narrow scope. \n1. It is a \u201cfundamental principle of statutory \nconstruction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the \nmeaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but \nmust be drawn from the context in which it is used.\u201d Deal \nv. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132 (1993). Here, the \nphrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d appears in the context \nof the immediately \u201csurrounding words\u201d\u2014\u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset \naside,\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d\u2014each of which denotes a specific \nform of equitable relief directed against the government. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. \nThe \u201ccanon of noscitur a sociis teaches that a word is \ngiven more precise content by the neighboring words with \nwhich it is associated.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. \n480, 481 (2024). For example, a statute that governs \n\u201cautomobiles, trucks, motorcycles, or any other self-\npropelled vehicle\u201d would not apply to airplanes\u2014even \nthough they are \u201cself-propelled vehicles\u201d\u2014because the \ncontext of the surrounding words limits the statute\u2019s scope \nto \u201cvehicle[s] running on land.\u201d McBoyle v. United States, \n283 U.S. 25, 26 (1931) (Holmes, J.). The same principle \napplies here. Because \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d is \npreceded by terms describing specific forms of equitable \nrelief directed against the government, noscitur a sociis \nholds that \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d should be read the \nsame way\u2014to refer to equitable relief directed against the \ngovernment in the form of a declaratory judgment. \n2. McKesson admits (at 14) that \u201c\u2018to enjoin, set aside, \n[or] suspend\u2019 refers to possible relief \u2026 such as an \ninjunction.\u201d Even so, the company claims (at 9) that \n\u201cdetermine the validity of,\u201d which appears alongside the \nother terms and as part of the same list, means something \n\n \n-6- \ntotally different\u2014namely, \u201ca court\u2019s decisional process in \nevaluating an order\u2019s merits.\u201d It would be odd, however, \nfor Congress to list three forms of equitable relief (all \nsought against the government) followed by an entirely \ndifferent\u2014and much broader\u2014unrelated term. That kind \nof broadening beyond the subject matter of a statute \nimplicates the very purpose of noscitur a sociis: to \n\u201censure[] \u2026 that none of [a statute\u2019s] specific parts are \nmade redundant by a clause\u201d that, taken \u201cliterally,\u201d is \n\u201cbroad enough to include them.\u201d Fischer, 603 U.S. at 488. \nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on here.3 \nMcKesson advances just one argument in support of \nits claim that the canon doesn\u2019t apply. In its view (at 17), \nbecause \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d in section 2342 \u201cis set \napart from the other terms with its own infinitive,\u201d the \ncanon is inapplicable. The company, however, provides no \nauthority for that proposition. Nor could it. Nothing in the \nnature of the canon or the cases interpreting it calls for \nrefusing to apply it simply because Congress used an \n \n3 Despite McKesson\u2019s concession that the listed terms refer to \n\u201crelief,\u201d it suggests in a footnote that the meaning of \u201cset aside\u201d is \n\u201cunsettled.\u201d McKesson Br. 17 n.2 (citing United States v. Texas, 599 \nU.S. 670, 695-702 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring)); see also U.S. Br. \n15. But the concurring opinion on which McKesson and the United \nStates rely simply reinforces the importance of context. As Justice \nGorsuch explained there, \u201cthe words \u2018set aside\u2019 in isolation \u2026 might \nsuggest to some a power to \u2018vacate\u2019 agency action,\u201d but \u201cjust as \nnaturally they might mean something else altogether.\u201d Texas, 599 \nU.S. at 695. In the \u201cstatutory context\u201d of the law at issue there (section \n706 of the APA), Justice Gorsuch concluded that \u201cset aside\u201d might \nreasonably be read to mean \u201cdisregard [the] offensive provisions \u2026 \nand proceed to decide the parties\u2019 dispute without respect to them.\u201d \nId. at 695, 696-99. But the \u201cstatutory context\u201d cuts the other way in \nthis case because, unlike section 706, the Hobbs Act includes \u201cset \naside\u201d as one element in a list of forms of relief. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). \n\n \n-7- \nadditional infinitive. Courts have had no difficulty \napplying it in just those circumstances. See ALDF v. U.S. \nDep\u2019t of Ag., 935 F.3d 858 (9th Cir. 2019) (applying the \ncanon to a \u201cjudicial review provision us[ing] the word \u2018to\u2019 \ntwice in the same sentence\u201d). \nOn the contrary, this case falls within the heartland of \nnoscitur a sociis. \u201cThe canon especially holds that words \ngrouped in a list should be given related meanings.\u201d \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 195 (2012). And its \u201cmost \ncommon effect\u201d is \u201cto limit a general term\u201d from that list \n\u201cto a subset of all the things or actions that it covers.\u201d Id. \nat 196. That\u2019s all we ask from the canon here: to limit the \ngeneral meaning of \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d to conform \nits scope to the other terms in the list in which it appears.  \nNor does McKesson offer even a common-sense \nexplanation as to how adding the word \u201cto\u201d could so \ndramatically change the import of the statutory language. \nCongress could have omitted the word entirely\u2014as in, \u201cto \nenjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or \ndetermine the validity of\u201d\u2014with no apparent effect on \nmeaning. If anything, \u201cthe use of an infinitive to \nintroduce\u201d the phrase suggests that it \u201cproscribes a \ndistinct category\u201d of equitable relief. United States v. \nNaftalin, 441 U.S. 768, 774 (1979). While the first three \nforms of relief listed are kinds of injunctions, the last \ninstead describes a declaratory judgment. \nYet, McKesson instead relies on the word \u201cto\u201d as \nproof of Congress\u2019s intent to strip the federal district \ncourts of power \u201cto say what the law is\u201d in cases before \nthem. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 9 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 145 \n\n \n-8- \n(1803)). That\u2019s far too much weight for a simple \npreposition to bear.  \n3. The weakness of McKesson\u2019s position is further \napparent from the fact that the government declines to \nendorse it. Indeed, the government has no answer at all to \nthe language of section 2342, except to say that noscitur a \nsociis doesn\u2019t apply to a statute that\u2019s unambiguous. U.S. \nBr. 14 (citing Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 \nU.S. 514, 519 (1923)). But that can\u2019t help the government \nhere, given that at least four members of this Court in \nPDR Network disagreed with its view on what that \n\u201cunambiguous\u201d language is supposed to mean. \nMoreover, the question \u201c[w]hether a statutory term is \nunambiguous \u2026 does not turn solely on dictionary \ndefinitions of its component words.\u201d Yates v. United \nStates, 574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015) (plurality op.). \u201cIn law as \nin life, \u2026 the same words, placed in different contexts, \nsometimes mean different things.\u201d Id. The government \nthus can\u2019t legitimately claim that \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d is unambiguous without first taking account of \u201cthe \nwords around it.\u201d Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, \n540 U.S. 581, 596 (2004). And here, as noted, context cuts \nstrongly against the government\u2019s reading. \n4. Finally, the expansive reading of \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d offered by McKesson and the government \ncannot be squared with this Court\u2019s \u201cduty to give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Duncan \nv. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). McKesson concedes \n(at 14) that, in its view, determining the validity of an \nagency action is a \u201cnecessary predicate to\u201d the \u201cremedial \nactions listed.\u201d But if that\u2019s true, there would have been no \nneed for Congress to enumerate specific forms of relief, \n\n \n-9- \ngiven that a court would have to \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d the order before granting any form of relief.4 \nOn our reading, in contrast, there is no surplusage. \nThe terms \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d \u201csuspend,\u201d and \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d each refer to distinct kinds of \nequitable relief a court may enter against agency action.  \nC. Broader statutory context confirms this \nreading. \n1. McKesson makes no further effort to reconcile its \nreading with section 2342\u2014the provision at issue here. \nInstead, it focuses much of its argument on section \n2349(a), which grants the courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction\u201d to enter \u201ca judgment determining the \nvalidity of, and enjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in \nwhole or in part, the order of the agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2349(a). McKesson latches onto section 2349(a)\u2019s inclusion \nof the word \u201cand,\u201d which it suggests (at 14, without \nexplanation) establishes a \u201ctwo-step process\u201d for courts to \nfollow: first \u201cevaluat[ing] the merits\u201d (by determining the \nvalidity of the order), and then \u201corder[ing] appropriate \nrelief\u201d (by enjoining, setting aside, or suspending it). \nThat reading, however, cannot be reconciled with the \nsection\u2019s text. By granting the courts of appeals \n \n4 The government (at 15) appears to disagree with McKesson\u2019s \nconcession on this point, arguing that a \u201ccourt might be asked to \n\u2018enjoin,\u2019 \u2018set aside,\u2019 or \u2018suspend\u2019 a covered agency action without \nconclusively determining its validity \u2026 when a party seeks a \npreliminary injunction.\u201d Notwithstanding the government\u2019s insertion \nof the word \u201cconclusively\u201d into section 2342\u2019s text, the statute is not \nso limited. Before a court can preliminarily enjoin an agency order, it \nwould also have to at least preliminarily \u201cdetermine the [order\u2019s] \nvalidity.\u201d \n\n \n-10- \njurisdiction to enter a \u201cjudgment determining the validity \nof\u201d an agency order, Congress did more than just \nauthorize them to \u201cevaluate the merits\u201d of an order\u2014it \nauthorized them to issue a remedy against it in the form \nof a \u201cjudgment.\u201d And a \u201cjudgment\u201d typically means a \ncourt\u2019s \u201cfinal determination of the rights and obligations \nof the parties\u201d\u2014not the court\u2019s reasoning in support of \nthat determination. Judgment, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary \n(12th ed. 2024); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a) (requiring \nthat a judgment \u201cbe set out in a separate document\u201d from \nthe court\u2019s reasoning).  \nEven more problematic for McKesson\u2019s reading is the \nfact that this case is not about the meaning of section \n2349(a), but section 2342. And that section replaces the \nword \u201cand\u201d with the word \u201cor.\u201d See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2342 \n(granting \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, \nsuspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof\u201d covered orders (emphasis added)). Thus, under \nMcKesson\u2019s reading of \u201cdetermine the validity of,\u201d section \n2342 grants the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction \neither to \u201cevaluate the merits\u201d of the order or to \u201corder \nappropriate relief.\u201d That, of course, makes no sense. As \nMcKesson admits (at 14), courts \u201ccannot do the latter \nwithout the former.\u201d The company\u2019s interpretation of \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d thus fails to give any plausible \nmeaning to the key language at issue here. \n3. McKesson\u2019s reading of section 2349(a) also fails for \nthe same reason as its reading of section 2342. Because \nsection 2349(a) lists \u201cdetermining the validity of\u201d along \nwith the same three specific forms of injunctive relief, it \nagain implicates the common-sense principle embodied by \nnoscitur a sociis that a term is \u201cgiven more precise \n\n \n-11- \ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is \nassociated.\u201d Fischer, 603 U.S. at 481.  \nThe company argues (at 17-18) that the canon doesn\u2019t \napply here because Congress\u2019s use of \u201cand\u201d in section \n2349(a) \u201csets \u2018determining the validity\u2019 off from the \nremedial \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc., 588 \nU.S. 1 (2019): Does the Hobbs Act require a district court \nto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA? \nThe respondents do not deny that this is an important \nand recurring question of federal law on which the circuits \nare divided\u2014just as it was when the Court granted review \nin PDR Network. Nor do they deny that the Ninth Circuit \nbelow applied its controlling precedent on this question \nand held that the district court \u201ccorrectly found that it was \nbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA. \nPet. App. 7a. And, importantly, the respondents do not \ncontend that either of the \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that \nultimately frustrated resolution of the question presented \nin PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 4, will do the same here. \nNevertheless, the respondents spend 36 pages trying \nto convince the Court that it should pass up the chance to \nfinally resolve this important question and the split that it \nhas caused. Their arguments pose no barrier to review.   \nA. The respondents first argue (at 13\u201316) that there is \nno \u201cpost-PDR Network split about interpretive rules,\u201d \nand that deciding the question that this Court intended to \ndecide five years ago would be \u201cpremature.\u201d But the \npetition asks the Court to resolve the circuit split on the \nquestion presented, which goes well beyond interpretive \nrules. That split prompted the Court to grant certiorari in \nPDR Network, and it still exists today. Nor does it matter \nwhether the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order is properly \nclassified as the equivalent of an interpretive rule (as the \nrespondents argued below). What matters is that, as the \ndistrict court below recognized, controlling Ninth Circuit \nprecedent treats the Amerifactors order as binding under \n\n- 2 - \n \nthe Hobbs Act regardless of how it\u2019s characterized. So the \nfirst preliminary issue identified in PDR Network stands \nas no obstacle to reaching the question presented here. \nNor would it be premature for the Court to decide that \nquestion now. The issue was ripe in 2018, when the Court \ngranted certiorari in PDR Network. And since then, the \nneed for authoritative resolution has only grown. Within \nmonths of this Court\u2019s decision declining to resolve the \nsplit, a full panel of the Eleventh Circuit called on that \ncourt \u201cto correct [its] mistake en banc\u201d \u201cin the earliest \nappropriate case.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., \nLP, 931 F.3d 1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But neither that court nor the Ninth Circuit \nin this case has done so. As a result, the pre-PDR Network \nsplit is alive and well. It now falls to this Court to bring \nneeded uniformity to the law on this important question. \nB. The respondents then turn to the merits (at 16\u201326). \nThe argue that the answer to the question presented is \nyes\u2014the Hobbs Act requires a district court in an as-\napplied enforcement proceeding to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA. That is so, they say, because \notherwise the court would have to \u201cdetermine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018sound [or] good,\u2019\u201d which the \nHobbs Act (in their view) prevents it from doing. BIO 17. \nThis argument was squarely rejected by four Justices in \nPDR Network, and the question to be resolved here will \nbe whether their reading of the Hobbs Act is correct. The \npetitioner says it is; the respondents say it\u2019s not. The point \nof plenary review will be to determine who\u2019s right. \nYet the bulk of the respondents\u2019 merits section is not \nabout the text of the Hobbs Act\u2014or even about the Hobbs \nAct at all. It is instead about whether the FCC was right \nto interpret the TCPA the way that it did. See BIO 21\u201326. \nBut that issue, which the Ninth Circuit did not reach, will \n\n- 3 - \n \nbe an issue for a lower court on remand. It has nothing to \ndo with the question presented and will not \u201cprevent the \nCourt from deciding the question presented.\u201d Contra BIO \n34. The question presented is whether a district court is \nbarred from even conducting a statutory analysis, not who \nwill prevail here should the court be permitted to do so.   \nC. Finally, the respondents make a vehicle argument. \nSee BIO 27\u201335. They claim that there are two distinctions \nbetween this case and PDR Network that make this case \nan unsuitable replacement for PDR Network. The most \n\u201cfundamental difference,\u201d in their eyes (at 17), is that in \nPDR Network, the party arguing that the Hobbs Act does \nnot require a district court to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA was the defendant, whereas \nhere it\u2019s the plaintiff. The respondents contend that this \nCourt \u201cshould await a case in which a defendant questions \nthe statutory interpretation in an FCC order.\u201d BIO 3.  \nBut the question presented is about the meaning of a \nstatute. And the Hobbs Act contains no hint that it means \nsomething different depending on which party is invoking \nit. Either the statute requires a district court to adhere to \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in an enforcement \naction or it does not. But the answer will not be different \ndepending on who happens to benefit from the FCC order. \nNor did Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, suggest any such reading of the statute. To the \ncontrary, his reading applies to plaintiffs and defendants \nalike. See 588 U.S. at 27 (\u201cIn an as-applied enforcement \naction, the district court should interpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). Although his opinion often \nframes the issue from the vantage point of a TCPA \ndefendant, it does so because that was the posture of that \ncase\u2014not because its textual analysis is reserved solely \n\n- 4 - \n \nfor the benefit of defendants. Contra BIO 18\u201319; see also \nGorss, 931 F.3d at 1109 (Pryor, J., concurring) (observing \nthat a \u201cstark implication[] of our misconstruction of the \nHobbs Act\u201d is that \u201ca plaintiff with a viable claim under \nthe law Congress enacted may be unable to pursue it \nsimply because an agency has misinterpreted the law in \nan order to which he was a not a party\u201d). No circuit, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit, has drawn any such atextual \ndistinction. Indeed, not even the respondents argue that \nthe statute\u2019s text could mean one thing for defendants and \nanother for plaintiffs. They simply disagree with Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s textual analysis, thus underscoring the \nappropriateness of this case as a vehicle. \nThe respondents also try to make something of the fact \nthat the FCC order in PDR Network predated that case \nby many years, whereas this case was filed six years \nbefore the Amerifactors order. That distinction, however, \nhas no bearing on the question presented. Unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \nprior or adequate opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct, which was the second preliminary issue noted in this \nCourt\u2019s opinion. So this difference, if anything, makes this \ncase a better vehicle than PDR Network, not a worse one. \nNor is there any realistic possibility that FCC action \nwill affect this Court\u2019s review. The respondents speculate \n(at 28) that the FCC could thwart review by acting on a \nfour-year-old application and reversing the Amerifactors \norder. But the respondents give no reason to think that \nthis will actually happen, and the theoretical possibility \nthat an agency could later change its mind is no reason for \nthis Court to stay its hand when the agency action is \ncausing real harm to real people. And here, not only is \nthere no deadline for the FCC to act, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4), \nbut the respondents point to no example of the FCC ever \n\n- 5 - \n \noverturning an interpretation that had been reached on \ndelegated authority, much less doing so without first \nengaging in notice and comment. Far from offering a \nreason why the FCC will reverse course, the respondents \ndo the opposite: They say that the order represents the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment\u201d and is \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d correct. \nBIO 26, 34. Again, if the respondents are right about what \nthe TCPA means, they should prevail on the merits on \nremand\u2014but only because a court reached that \nconclusion, not because an agency did so.  \nAs for the respondents\u2019 argument that the petitioner \nshould be bound by the FCC\u2019s order under \u201cnormal \npreclusion principles,\u201d BIO 32, that argument is even \nmore off-base. It is wrong, independent of the question \npresented, and waived to boot. The petitioner was entitled \nto make its statutory arguments\u2014and to continue seeking \nas-applied relief\u2014in the same case that it had been \nlitigating for six years before the FCC order. It was not \nrequired to halt that litigation and pursue the \u201cconvoluted \nroute\u201d of Hobbs Act review. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 25 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But that\u2019s an argument that \ncan be dealt with by the Ninth Circuit on remand, along \nwith the question of whether the respondents have even \npreserved the issue. It is not an impediment to this Court\u2019s \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \n The petition for certiorari should be granted. \n\n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n       Respectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

No. 81-2618 (1950) .................................................. 13 \n \n\n \n-1- \nINTRODUCTION \nMcKesson asks this Court to adopt a strikingly broad \nreading of the Hobbs Act\u2014one that would strip the \nfederal courts (including this Court) of jurisdiction in \nprivate enforcement actions to second-guess an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute. Nobody questions that the \nHobbs Act\u2019s grant of \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d is designed \nto funnel facial, pre-enforcement challenges to agency \nactions into the courts of appeals. No matter how the \nCourt resolves this case, those challenges will continue. \nBut McKesson\u2019s construction would extend that exclusive \njurisdiction to include garden-variety civil litigation \nbetween private parties in district court. If Congress \nreally wanted to deprive courts of jurisdiction to question \nagencies\u2019 reading of statutes in such cases, it knew how to \ndo so. See, e.g., 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1). That Congress \ndidn\u2019t use comparable language here is strong evidence \nthat it had no such intent.  \nAlthough McKesson barely acknowledges it, four \njustices have already squarely rejected its far-reaching \nposition. See PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, 588 U.S. 1, 9 (2019) (Thomas, J., \nconcurring); id. at 12 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). And for \ngood reason: That reading, which relies primarily on \ndictionary definitions at the expense of context, fails to \nplausibly account for the statute\u2019s plain meaning and \nsurrounding text (much of which it would render \nsuperfluous), ignores the statute\u2019s history, and raises \nserious constitutional problems. Neither McKesson nor \nthe government\u2014which recycles its arguments nearly \n\n \n-2- \nverbatim from PDR Network\u2014comes up with convincing \nanswers to these problems.1 \nEven if the Hobbs Act did foreclose a district court\u2019s \nreview of an agency\u2019s legislative rules (which have the \nforce of law), the Ninth Circuit was still wrong to apply \nthat limit to the FCC\u2019s interpretive (and thus non-binding) \norder here. Both parties agreed below that the agency\u2019s \nAmerifactors order is interpretive because, rather than \ncreating new rules or standards of conduct, it serves \nprimarily to advise the public about the agency\u2019s \nconstruction of the statute it administers. Because this \nkind of interpretive rule lacks the force of law, it can never \nbind parties and courts\u2014whether or not the Hobbs Act\u2019s \nexclusive jurisdiction applies. \nAs this Court recently reaffirmed in Loper Bright \nEnterprises v. Raimondo, the \u201cinterpretation of the \nmeaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable contro-\nversies,\u201d is \u201cexclusively a judicial function.\u201d 603 U.S. 369, \n387 (2024). The approach pushed by McKesson and the \ngovernment, however, would require courts to afford \u201cnot \nmere Skidmore deference or Chevron deference, but \nabsolute deference\u201d to agencies for all manner of informal \nand otherwise non-binding interpretive rules and \nguidance documents\u2014\u201cno matter how wrong the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation might be.\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). That would threaten a \n\u201cproposition reflected by judicial practice dating back to \nMarbury: that courts decide legal questions by applying \ntheir own judgment.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 391. \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted, all internal quotation marks, citations, \nand alterations have been omitted from quotations.  \n\n \n-3- \nTo avoid the many serious problems caused by \nMcKesson\u2019s rule, this Court should read the Hobbs Act as \nwhat it is: a commonplace jurisdictional statute designed \nto allow parties to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief \nagainst agencies in the courts of appeals; not a mandate \nfor judicial \u201cabdication\u201d to federal agencies. PDR \nNetwork, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Hobbs Act does not forbid the federal courts \nfrom disagreeing with an agency\u2019s interpretation \nof a statute in a private enforcement suit. \nA. The Hobbs Act\u2019s plain language limits the \nAct\u2019s coverage to actions for declaratory or \ninjunctive relief. \nOur opening brief explains why \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of,\u201d as used in the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, is \nbest read as an authorization for the courts of appeals to \nissue declaratory judgments on covered agency orders\u2014\njust as it authorizes them to issue other forms of equitable \nrelief. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cvalid\u201d includes \n\u201chaving legal force; effective or binding.\u201d American \nHeritage Dictionary (4th ed. 2006). To \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d an order under this reading thus means to \ndetermine whether the order is legally in effect. And the \nHobbs Act requires the courts of appeals to make this \ndetermination in a \u201cjudgment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2349(a). As \nJustice Kavanaugh explained in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, a court can do that \u201conly by entering a \ndeclaratory judgment that the order is valid or invalid.\u201d \n588 U.S. at 21. That\u2019s the mechanism that courts routinely \nuse to \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d statutes and regulations. \nRy. Mail Ass\u2019n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 91 (1945) (noting that \n\n \n-4- \nthe plaintiff sought \u201ca declaratory judgment to determine \nthe validity of\u201d a statute).2 \nMcKesson cannot deny that this reading is consistent \nwith the plain meaning of \u201cdeclare the validity.\u201d As the \ngovernment correctly notes (at 13): \u201cEntering a judgment \ndeclaring an agency action to be invalid (or valid) is surely \none means of determining the validity of that action.\u201d \nInstead, McKesson offers an alternative (and much \nbroader) definition of the phrase that would extend to any \n\u201cdecision on whether the agency order was correct, \nregardless of the relief sought.\u201d McKesson Br. 12; see also \nU.S. Br. 12 (arguing that the phrase covers decisions on \nwhether an order is \u201cgrounded\u201d in \u201csound principles\u201d). It \nnever argues, however, that this interpretation is the only \npossible reading. See McKesson Br. 12 (calling its \npreferred definition \u201ca common, ordinary meaning of \u2018to \ndetermine the validity\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)). Dictionaries \nequally support our reading as an alternative definition of \n\u201cvalid.\u201d See Br. 21; U.S. Br. 12. Because there are thus at \nleast \u201ctwo grammatically permissible ways\u201d to read \n\u201cdetermine the validity of,\u201d the Court must resolve the \nconflict \u201cby reviewing [the] text in context.\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 133 (2024). \n \n2 The government makes a preliminary suggestion (at 10-12) that \nthe Ninth Circuit \u201cerred in treating\u201d the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order \nas a \u201cfinal order\u201d covered by the Hobbs Act. Although we don\u2019t \ndisagree, this Court granted certiorari on the premise that the order \nwas final\u2014just as it did in PDR Network. See 588 U.S. at 6 \n(\u201cassum[ing] without deciding\u201d that the FCC action was \u201ca \u2018final \norder\u2019\u201d under the Hobbs Act). As the government itself acknowledges \n(at 11-12), the Court therefore \u201cmay assume for purposes of this case \nthat the Amerifactors order is covered.\u201d  \n\n \n-5- \nB. The surrounding language of section 2342 \nfurther fixes the Act\u2019s narrow scope. \n1. It is a \u201cfundamental principle of statutory \nconstruction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the \nmeaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but \nmust be drawn from the context in which it is used.\u201d Deal \nv. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132 (1993). Here, the \nphrase \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d appears in the context \nof the immediately \u201csurrounding words\u201d\u2014\u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset \naside,\u201d and \u201csuspend\u201d\u2014each of which denotes a specific \nform of equitable relief directed against the government. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. \nThe \u201ccanon of noscitur a sociis teaches that a word is \ngiven more precise content by the neighboring words with \nwhich it is associated.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. \n480, 481 (2024). For example, a statute that governs \n\u201cautomobiles, trucks, motorcycles, or any other self-\npropelled vehicle\u201d would not apply to airplanes\u2014even \nthough they are \u201cself-propelled vehicles\u201d\u2014because the \ncontext of the surrounding words limits the statute\u2019s scope \nto \u201cvehicle[s] running on land.\u201d McBoyle v. United States, \n283 U.S. 25, 26 (1931) (Holmes, J.). The same principle \napplies here. Because \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d is \npreceded by terms describing specific forms of equitable \nrelief directed against the government, noscitur a sociis \nholds that \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d should be read the \nsame way\u2014to refer to equitable relief directed against the \ngovernment in the form of a declaratory judgment. \n2. McKesson admits (at 14) that \u201c\u2018to enjoin, set aside, \n[or] suspend\u2019 refers to possible relief \u2026 such as an \ninjunction.\u201d Even so, the company claims (at 9) that \n\u201cdetermine the validity of,\u201d which appears alongside the \nother terms and as part of the same list, means something \n\n \n-6- \ntotally different\u2014namely, \u201ca court\u2019s decisional process in \nevaluating an order\u2019s merits.\u201d It would be odd, however, \nfor Congress to list three forms of equitable relief (all \nsought against the government) followed by an entirely \ndifferent\u2014and much broader\u2014unrelated term. That kind \nof broadening beyond the subject matter of a statute \nimplicates the very purpose of noscitur a sociis: to \n\u201censure[] \u2026 that none of [a statute\u2019s] specific parts are \nmade redundant by a clause\u201d that, taken \u201cliterally,\u201d is \n\u201cbroad enough to include them.\u201d Fischer, 603 U.S. at 488. \nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on here.3 \nMcKesson advances just one argument in support of \nits claim that the canon doesn\u2019t apply. In its view (at 17), \nbecause \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d in section 2342 \u201cis set \napart from the other terms with its own infinitive,\u201d the \ncanon is inapplicable. The company, however, provides no \nauthority for that proposition. Nor could it. Nothing in the \nnature of the canon or the cases interpreting it calls for \nrefusing to apply it simply because Congress used an \n \n3 Despite McKesson\u2019s concession that the listed terms refer to \n\u201crelief,\u201d it suggests in a footnote that the meaning of \u201cset aside\u201d is \n\u201cunsettled.\u201d McKesson Br. 17 n.2 (citing United States v. Texas, 599 \nU.S. 670, 695-702 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring)); see also U.S. Br. \n15. But the concurring opinion on which McKesson and the United \nStates rely simply reinforces the importance of context. As Justice \nGorsuch explained there, \u201cthe words \u2018set aside\u2019 in isolation \u2026 might \nsuggest to some a power to \u2018vacate\u2019 agency action,\u201d but \u201cjust as \nnaturally they might mean something else altogether.\u201d Texas, 599 \nU.S. at 695. In the \u201cstatutory context\u201d of the law at issue there (section \n706 of the APA), Justice Gorsuch concluded that \u201cset aside\u201d might \nreasonably be read to mean \u201cdisregard [the] offensive provisions \u2026 \nand proceed to decide the parties\u2019 dispute without respect to them.\u201d \nId. at 695, 696-99. But the \u201cstatutory context\u201d cuts the other way in \nthis case because, unlike section 706, the Hobbs Act includes \u201cset \naside\u201d as one element in a list of forms of relief. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). \n\n \n-7- \nadditional infinitive. Courts have had no difficulty \napplying it in just those circumstances. See ALDF v. U.S. \nDep\u2019t of Ag., 935 F.3d 858 (9th Cir. 2019) (applying the \ncanon to a \u201cjudicial review provision us[ing] the word \u2018to\u2019 \ntwice in the same sentence\u201d). \nOn the contrary, this case falls within the heartland of \nnoscitur a sociis. \u201cThe canon especially holds that words \ngrouped in a list should be given related meanings.\u201d \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 195 (2012). And its \u201cmost \ncommon effect\u201d is \u201cto limit a general term\u201d from that list \n\u201cto a subset of all the things or actions that it covers.\u201d Id. \nat 196. That\u2019s all we ask from the canon here: to limit the \ngeneral meaning of \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d to conform \nits scope to the other terms in the list in which it appears.  \nNor does McKesson offer even a common-sense \nexplanation as to how adding the word \u201cto\u201d could so \ndramatically change the import of the statutory language. \nCongress could have omitted the word entirely\u2014as in, \u201cto \nenjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or \ndetermine the validity of\u201d\u2014with no apparent effect on \nmeaning. If anything, \u201cthe use of an infinitive to \nintroduce\u201d the phrase suggests that it \u201cproscribes a \ndistinct category\u201d of equitable relief. United States v. \nNaftalin, 441 U.S. 768, 774 (1979). While the first three \nforms of relief listed are kinds of injunctions, the last \ninstead describes a declaratory judgment. \nYet, McKesson instead relies on the word \u201cto\u201d as \nproof of Congress\u2019s intent to strip the federal district \ncourts of power \u201cto say what the law is\u201d in cases before \nthem. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 9 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 145 \n\n \n-8- \n(1803)). That\u2019s far too much weight for a simple \npreposition to bear.  \n3. The weakness of McKesson\u2019s position is further \napparent from the fact that the government declines to \nendorse it. Indeed, the government has no answer at all to \nthe language of section 2342, except to say that noscitur a \nsociis doesn\u2019t apply to a statute that\u2019s unambiguous. U.S. \nBr. 14 (citing Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 \nU.S. 514, 519 (1923)). But that can\u2019t help the government \nhere, given that at least four members of this Court in \nPDR Network disagreed with its view on what that \n\u201cunambiguous\u201d language is supposed to mean. \nMoreover, the question \u201c[w]hether a statutory term is \nunambiguous \u2026 does not turn solely on dictionary \ndefinitions of its component words.\u201d Yates v. United \nStates, 574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015) (plurality op.). \u201cIn law as \nin life, \u2026 the same words, placed in different contexts, \nsometimes mean different things.\u201d Id. The government \nthus can\u2019t legitimately claim that \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d is unambiguous without first taking account of \u201cthe \nwords around it.\u201d Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, \n540 U.S. 581, 596 (2004). And here, as noted, context cuts \nstrongly against the government\u2019s reading. \n4. Finally, the expansive reading of \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d offered by McKesson and the government \ncannot be squared with this Court\u2019s \u201cduty to give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Duncan \nv. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). McKesson concedes \n(at 14) that, in its view, determining the validity of an \nagency action is a \u201cnecessary predicate to\u201d the \u201cremedial \nactions listed.\u201d But if that\u2019s true, there would have been no \nneed for Congress to enumerate specific forms of relief, \n\n \n-9- \ngiven that a court would have to \u201cdetermine the validity \nof\u201d the order before granting any form of relief.4 \nOn our reading, in contrast, there is no surplusage. \nThe terms \u201cenjoin,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d \u201csuspend,\u201d and \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d each refer to distinct kinds of \nequitable relief a court may enter against agency action.  \nC. Broader statutory context confirms this \nreading. \n1. McKesson makes no further effort to reconcile its \nreading with section 2342\u2014the provision at issue here. \nInstead, it focuses much of its argument on section \n2349(a), which grants the courts of appeals \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction\u201d to enter \u201ca judgment determining the \nvalidity of, and enjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in \nwhole or in part, the order of the agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2349(a). McKesson latches onto section 2349(a)\u2019s inclusion \nof the word \u201cand,\u201d which it suggests (at 14, without \nexplanation) establishes a \u201ctwo-step process\u201d for courts to \nfollow: first \u201cevaluat[ing] the merits\u201d (by determining the \nvalidity of the order), and then \u201corder[ing] appropriate \nrelief\u201d (by enjoining, setting aside, or suspending it). \nThat reading, however, cannot be reconciled with the \nsection\u2019s text. By granting the courts of appeals \n \n4 The government (at 15) appears to disagree with McKesson\u2019s \nconcession on this point, arguing that a \u201ccourt might be asked to \n\u2018enjoin,\u2019 \u2018set aside,\u2019 or \u2018suspend\u2019 a covered agency action without \nconclusively determining its validity \u2026 when a party seeks a \npreliminary injunction.\u201d Notwithstanding the government\u2019s insertion \nof the word \u201cconclusively\u201d into section 2342\u2019s text, the statute is not \nso limited. Before a court can preliminarily enjoin an agency order, it \nwould also have to at least preliminarily \u201cdetermine the [order\u2019s] \nvalidity.\u201d \n\n \n-10- \njurisdiction to enter a \u201cjudgment determining the validity \nof\u201d an agency order, Congress did more than just \nauthorize them to \u201cevaluate the merits\u201d of an order\u2014it \nauthorized them to issue a remedy against it in the form \nof a \u201cjudgment.\u201d And a \u201cjudgment\u201d typically means a \ncourt\u2019s \u201cfinal determination of the rights and obligations \nof the parties\u201d\u2014not the court\u2019s reasoning in support of \nthat determination. Judgment, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary \n(12th ed. 2024); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a) (requiring \nthat a judgment \u201cbe set out in a separate document\u201d from \nthe court\u2019s reasoning).  \nEven more problematic for McKesson\u2019s reading is the \nfact that this case is not about the meaning of section \n2349(a), but section 2342. And that section replaces the \nword \u201cand\u201d with the word \u201cor.\u201d See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2342 \n(granting \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, \nsuspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof\u201d covered orders (emphasis added)). Thus, under \nMcKesson\u2019s reading of \u201cdetermine the validity of,\u201d section \n2342 grants the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction \neither to \u201cevaluate the merits\u201d of the order or to \u201corder \nappropriate relief.\u201d That, of course, makes no sense. As \nMcKesson admits (at 14), courts \u201ccannot do the latter \nwithout the former.\u201d The company\u2019s interpretation of \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d thus fails to give any plausible \nmeaning to the key language at issue here. \n3. McKesson\u2019s reading of section 2349(a) also fails for \nthe same reason as its reading of section 2342. Because \nsection 2349(a) lists \u201cdetermining the validity of\u201d along \nwith the same three specific forms of injunctive relief, it \nagain implicates the common-sense principle embodied by \nnoscitur a sociis that a term is \u201cgiven more precise \n\n \n-11- \ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is \nassociated.\u201d Fischer, 603 U.S. at 481.  \nThe company argues (at 17-18) that the canon doesn\u2019t \napply here because Congress\u2019s use of \u201cand\u201d in section \n2349(a) \u201csets \u2018determining the validity\u2019 off from the \nremedial actions listed,\u201d making it \u201cnot even part of the \nsame list.\u201d That\u2019s a strange claim to make about the word \n\u201cand,\u201d given that the whole purpose of the word is to \n\u201cindicate connection \u2026 especially of items within the same \nclass or type.\u201d See Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, \nhttps://perma.cc/L8HT-LG46.  \nRegardless, \u201c[a]lthough most associated-words cases \ninvolve listings\u2014usually a parallel series of nouns and \nnoun phrases, or verbs and verb phrases\u2014a listing is not \nprerequisite.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 197. More broadly, the \ndoctrine derives from \u201cthe basic principle that words are \ngiven meaning by their context\u201d and applies any time \n\u201cseveral nouns or verbs \u2026 are associated in a context \nsuggesting that the words have something in common.\u201d \nId. at 195. \u201cAn \u2018association\u2019 is all that is required\u201d for the \ncanon to apply, id. at 197, and that\u2019s precisely what the \nword \u201cand\u201d provides here. \nJust as McKesson\u2019s reading of section 2342 renders \nthe listed forms of injunctive relief superfluous, its \nreading of section 2349(a) does the same for the phrase \n\u201cdetermining the validity of.\u201d That\u2019s because, if \n\u201cdetermining the validity of\u201d an agency order is (as \nMcKesson claims) a necessary predicate to issuing \ninjunctive relief, a court wouldn\u2019t need separate \nauthorization from Congress to do it. Federal courts don\u2019t \nneed Congress\u2019s permission to give reasons for their \n\n \n-12- \ndecisions\u2014a task that goes to the very heart of the judicial \nrole. See Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 391. \n4. Perhaps recognizing the flaws in McKesson\u2019s \nconstruction, the government doesn\u2019t try to deny that \nsection 2349(a)\u2019s reference to a \u201cjudgment determining \nthe validity of\u201d an agency order authorizes a remedy in the \nform of a declaratory judgment. Ordinarily, that would be \nthe end of the matter. The \u201cnormal rule of statutory \nconstruction\u201d is that \u201cidentical words used in different \nparts of the same act are intended to have the same \nmeaning.\u201d Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 570 \n(1995). \nThe government, however, relies on the fact that, \nunlike section 2349(a), the word \u201cjudgment\u201d doesn\u2019t \nappear before \u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d in section \n2342\u2014an omission that it argues (at 16) \u201cwas presumably \ndeliberate and should be given effect.\u201d But the \ngovernment never explains the significance of that \ndifference, which in any case is easily explainable by the \ndifferent purposes of the two provisions. While section \n2342 grants the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review \nagency actions, section 2349(a) grants them jurisdiction to \n\u201cmake and enter \u2026 a judgment\u201d in those proceedings. \nSince only section 2349(a) discusses a court\u2019s authority to \nenter judgments, it should not be surprising that the word \n\u201cjudgment\u201d occurs only in that section.  \nD. McKesson\u2019s contrary position cannot be \nsquared with the Hobbs Act\u2019s history or the \nlanguage of comparable review provisions. \n1. Both McKesson and the government also look for \nsupport for their position in the Hobbs Act\u2019s legislative \nhistory. In doing so, however, they entirely ignore the \n\n \n-13- \nmost relevant piece of history, cited in our opening brief \n(at 7) and in the amicus brief of the Local Government \nLegal Center (at 5-6), which expressly recognizes that the \nAct was never intended to \u201crelate to actions between \nprivate parties.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 80-1619, at 4 (1948); see \nalso Jason N. Sigalos, The Other Hobbs Act: An Old \nLeviathan in the Modern Administrative State, 54 Ga. L. \nRev. 1095, 1122 (2020) (noting that the \u201cdrafters did not \nintend the jurisdictional reforms to apply to private \nenforcement actions\u201d). To the extent legislative history is \nimportant, that language is dispositive. Yet neither \nMcKesson nor the government even acknowledge it. \nThe legislative history on which McKesson relies is \nnot to the contrary. For example, it cites (at 36) a Senate \nreport for the proposition that Congress intended to \n\u201cforeclose[] judicial review of Hobbs Act-covered orders.\u201d \nBut the report in fact says the opposite, providing that the \n\u201cpattern used\u201d in the Hobbs Act was the same \u201cone \nestablished for review of orders of \u2026 many other \nagencies,\u201d S. Rep. No. 81-2618, at 4 (1950)\u2014none of which \nrestrict litigation between private parties in district court.  \n2. McKesson and the government also look to this \nCourt\u2019s decisions interpreting the Hobbs Act and its \npredecessor, the Urgent Deficiencies Act. But the \ndecisions they cite do not adopt their view that parties in \nprivate litigation are precluded from seeking review of an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. Rather, they hold only \nthat \nparties \ncan\u2019t \nbypass \nexclusive \ndirect-review \nproceedings by effectively bringing the same kinds of \nclaims in district court. \nThe first, Venner v. Michigan Central Railroad Co., \ninvolved an order by the Interstate Commerce \nCommission authorizing an agreement between railroad \n\n \n-14- \ncompanies. 271 U.S. 127, 128 (1926). The day after the ICC \nissued the order, the plaintiff sued in state court \u201cto enjoin \nthe defendant company from carrying out [the] agreement \n\u2026 notwithstanding its approval by the\u201d ICC. Id. at 129. \nThis Court held that the suit was subject to the ICC\u2019s \nexclusive jurisdiction because it was \u201cessentially one to \nannul or set aside the order of the Commission.\u201d Id. \nAlthough the plaintiff did not \u201cexpressly pray that the \norder be annulled or set aside, it [did] assail the validity of \nthe order and pray that the defendant company be \nenjoined from doing what the order specifically \nauthorizes.\u201d Id. That, the Court concluded, \u201cis equivalent \nto asking that the order be adjudged invalid and set \naside.\u201d Id.; see also Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & \nO.R. Co., 258 U.S. 377, 380-81 (1922) (disapproving of a suit \nthat \u201cin effect\u201d attempted to set aside an ICC order).    \nLikewise, the plaintiff in FCC v. ITT World \nCommunications, Inc. simultaneously sought relief under \nthe Hobbs Act in a court of appeals and in federal district \ncourt. 466 U.S. 463, 465-66 (1984). Like Venner, the case \njust stands for the proposition that \u201c[l]itigants may not \nevade\u201d the Hobbs Act so easily. Id. at 468; see also Port of \nBos. Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970) (rejecting a collateral \nchallenge to a Federal Maritime Commission order \nbrought by a party who was \u201crepresented before the \nCommission\u201d and had \u201cmade numerous claims to party \nstatus.\u201d). \n These cases do no more than shut down collateral \nchallenges that could have been brought under the Hobbs \nAct in the courts of appeals. They have nothing to say \nabout ordinary civil litigation like this case, which doesn\u2019t \n\n \n-15- \ndirectly challenge any agency order and in which plaintiffs \nhave no choice but to file in district court. \n3. Next, McKesson and the government rehash \narguments from PDR Network about the Emergency \nPrice Control Act, which this Court in Yakus v. United \nStates read to give \u201cclear indication\u201d of Congress\u2019s intent \nto preclude district courts from considering the validity of \nwartime price regulations in enforcement proceedings. \n321 U.S. 414, 429-31 (1944). The government contends that \nCongress \u201ctransplanted\u201d the EPCA\u2019s language to the \nHobbs Act, \u201cbring[ing] the old soil with it.\u201d U.S. Br. 20 \n(quoting Stokeling v. United States, 586 U.S. 73, 80 \n(2019)). But as our opening brief explained (at 34-35), the \nEPCA\u2019s review provision contained an additional sentence \n(missing from the Hobbs Act) that expressly deprived \ndistrict courts of jurisdiction even \u201cto consider\u201d covered \nagency orders in enforcement actions. PDR Network, 588 \nU.S. at 23 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (emphasis added). \nAs Justice Kavanaugh explained in PDR Network, it was \nthis language from the EPCA\u2014\u201ccoupled with\u201d its \nexclusive-jurisdiction provision\u2014that \u201ctogether\u201d fore-\nclosed review in the district courts. Id. \nThere is no comparable language here. In contrast to \nthe EPCA, the Hobbs Act lacks a separate provision \nexpressly depriving the district courts of jurisdiction. See \nid. And its grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of \nappeals also uses narrower language than that EPCA \nprovision, which deprived district courts of jurisdiction \neven \n\u201cto \nconsider\u201d \ncovered \nagency \norders. \nId. \nFurthermore, Yakus found it \u201cappropriate to take into \naccount,\u201d 321 U.S. at 431, the fact that the law was \u201ca \ntemporary wartime measure,\u201d id. at 419, enacted when \n\u201cthe need for quick and definitive judicial rulings on the \n\n \n-16- \nlegality of agency orders was at its apex,\u201d PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 24-25 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). This Court \nhas never applied Yakus\u2019s holding to the peacetime \ncontext, and the decision likely retains little relevance \ntoday. See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, \n838 n.15 (1987) (noting that Yakus was \u201cmotivated by the \nexigencies of wartime\u201d). \n4. Lastly, McKesson points (at 36) to section 703 of the \nAPA, which provides: \u201cExcept to the extent that prior, \nadequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial review is \nprovided by law, agency action is subject to judicial review \nin civil or criminal proceedings for judicial enforcement.\u201d \nBecause the Hobbs Act provides for \u201cexclusive\u201d review of \nthe FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order, it argues, section 703 \nprecludes such \u201cjudicial review\u201d here. \nBut that argument only works for McKesson if this \nCourt accepts its interpretation of the Hobbs Act\u2019s scope. \nAlthough it is true that the Hobbs Act gives the courts of \nappeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over certain cases, that \nfact does not answer the question: \u201cexclusive jurisdiction \nto do what?\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 20 (Kavanaugh, \nJ., concurring). As Justice Kavanaugh explained, the \nHobbs Act grants courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction \nonly \u201cto issue an injunction or declaratory judgment \nregarding the agency\u2019s order\u201d in a pre-enforcement facial \nchallenge. Id. at 21. It thus does not foreclose judicial \nreview in cases, like this one, between private parties in \ndistrict court. Id.  \nIf it were otherwise, numerous other review \nprovisions\u2014such as the statute providing for \u201cexclusive\u201d \nreview of SEC orders in the courts of appeal, 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 78y(b)(3)\u2014would likewise preclude litigation in the \ndistrict courts. See Opening Br. 32. These statutes possess \n\n \n-17- \nthe very features that McKesson claims to be \ndistinguishing features of the Hobbs Act: They confer \n\u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction over \u201creview\u201d of agency action. \nYet courts have never extended them to preclude judicial \nreview of agency action in private litigation in district \ncourt. See, e.g., United States v. O\u2019Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, \n666-76 (1997); see also PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 21-22 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nMcKesson correctly points out (at 19) that the SEC\u2019s \nexclusive review provision comes from a statutory scheme \nseparate from the Hobbs Act that does not expressly vest \nthe courts of appeals with jurisdiction to \u201cdetermine the \nvalidity of\u201d agency orders. Nevertheless, the statute\u2019s \nlanguage is, if anything, even broader than the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s, covering without qualification all \u201creview\u201d of SEC \norders. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(b)(1). Similarly, OSHA\u2019s review \nstatute covers any suit seeking \u201cjudicial review\u201d of OSHA \nstandards. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f). Although that statute \ndoesn\u2019t expressly say \u201cexclusive,\u201d this Court deems any \nsuch \u201cspecific statutory scheme[s] for obtaining review\u201d to \nbe \u201cexclusive\u201d whether or not it says so expressly. \nWhitney Nat\u2019l Bank v. Bank of New Orleans & Tr. Co., \n379 U.S. 411, 420-422 (1965).  \nMcKesson likewise cannot square its interpretation of \nthe Hobbs Act with statutes like the Clean Air Act and \nCERCLA, which contain direct review provisions \ncomparable to the Hobbs Act\u2019s, but also expressly \npreclude review in enforcement proceedings. Its claim (at \n39) that these statutes are \u201cexactly\u201d like the Hobbs Act is \nsimply wrong. Indeed, although McKesson never \nacknowledges it, four justices in PDR Network reached \nexactly the opposite conclusion, noting that the statutes go \nmuch further than the Hobbs Act by including language \n\n \n-18- \n\u201cexpressly preclud[ing] judicial review in subsequent \nenforcement actions.\u201d 588 U.S. at 16-17 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring). That clear language serves as strong \nevidence \u201cthat Congress\u2019s silence in the Hobbs Act should \nnot be read to preclude judicial review.\u201d Id. at 16-17. \nE. Constitutional avoidance principles favor \nreversal. \nAt a minimum, even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act were plausible, the \nconstitutional-doubt canon would compel an alternative \nreading. Br. 35-37. If a district court \u201ccould never second-\nguess agency interpretations in orders subject to the \nHobbs Act,\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., LP, 931 \nF.3d 1094, 1110-11 (11th Cir. 2019), then the Hobbs Act \nlikely intrudes \u201cupon Article III\u2019s vesting of the \u2018judicial \nPower\u2019 in the courts,\u201d PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 9 \n(Thomas, J., concurring). And the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading \nlikewise \u201craises significant questions under the Due \nProcess Clause.\u201d Id. at 19 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  \nMcKesson responds (at 40) that the APA provides a \n\u201csafety valve\u201d when there is no \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity for \nreview. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. Because PDR Network left the \nadequacy question unresolved, id. at 7, it\u2019s impossible to \nknow the degree to which McKesson is right that section \n703 answers the \u201csubstantial due process question\u201d that \nJustice Kavanaugh raised there, id. at 19 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring). But as the government told this Court, its \nview on \u201c\u2018adequacy\u2019 in Section 703\u201d was that \u201cjudicial \nreview is not inadequate simply because a particular \nlitigant fails to satisfy the statutory prerequisites for \ninvoking it.\u201d U.S. Br. in PDR Network 26. On that view, \nthe government argued that PDR Network had an \n\u201cadequate\u201d opportunity to challenge the order at issue \n\n \n-19- \ndespite the company\u2019s claim that, at the time the order \nwas issued, it was not affected by it and had no interest in \nchallenging it. See Reply Br. in PDR Network 15. \nRegardless of the correctness of the government\u2019s harsh \nreading of section 703, McKesson\u2019s position would, at a \nminimum, force courts to resolve due process issues on a \ncase-by-case basis to determine whether they have \njurisdiction\u2014contradicting \u201cthe rule that jurisdictional \nrules should be clear.\u201d Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 \nU.S. 1, 14 (2015). \nII. The Act cannot bind courts to interpretive rules \nthat were never designed to be binding in the first \nplace. \nA. Alternatively, the district court was not bound to \nfollow the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order because the order is \ninterpretive, rather than legislative, and thus incapable of \nbinding either parties or courts. See Br. 37-42. Although \nthe parties agreed below that the order is an interpretive \nrule, ER 140, McKesson now argues that it is not a rule at \nall, but \u201ca declaratory order resulting from an \nadjudication.\u201d McKesson Br. 47. \nBut the interpretive/legislative distinction applies \nregardless of whether the procedural path the agency \ntakes is rulemaking or adjudication; what matters is the \nsubstance of the agency\u2019s action. See Chrysler Corp. v. \nEnv\u2019t Prot. Agency, 600 F.2d 904, 916 (D.C. Cir. 1979) \n(noting that an adjudicative order can be \u201cinterpretive \nrather than legislative\u201d). As this Court wrote in Martin v. \nOSHA Review Commission, \u201cadjudication operates as an \nappropriate \nmechanism\u201d \nfor \n\u201clawmaking \nby \ninterpretation.\u201d 499 U.S. 144, 154 (1991); see also Beneli v. \nNat\u2019l Lab. Rels. Bd., 873 F.3d 1094, 1103 (9th Cir. 2017) \n\n \n-20- \n(holding that the APA \u201callows an agency to declare \ninterpretive rules in adjudication\u201d). \nMcKesson resists this conclusion, arguing (at 49) that \norders \nresulting \nfrom \nagency \nadjudications, \nlike \nlegislative rules, \u201chave the force and effect of law.\u201d The \nonly authority that McKesson cites for this proposition is \nthe majority opinion in PDR Network. But the Court \nthere held the opposite: that the FCC order there could be \neither \u201cthe equivalent of a \u2018legislative rule\u2019\u201d or \u201cinstead \nthe equivalent of an \u2018interpretive rule.\u2019\u201d PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 7 (emphasis added); see also id. at 9 n.* \n(Thomas, J., concurring) (noting that the order was \n\u201cclearly interpretive\u201d because it was \u201cissued by an agency \nto advise the public of the agency\u2019s construction of\u201d the \nTCPA). \nMany other courts have likewise considered whether \nFCC declaratory orders are legislative or interpretive, \nnotwithstanding that the agency issued them through \nadjudications. The D.C. Circuit in Central Texas \nTelephone Co-op., for example, held that an FCC \n\u201cDeclaratory Ruling,\u201d though deemed an \u201corder\u201d and \nreached through \u201cadjudication,\u201d was still subject to the \ndistinction between legislative and interpretive rules. 402 \nF.3d at 210; see, e.g., Viacom Int\u2019l Inc. v. FCC, 672 F.2d \n1034, 1042 (2d Cir. 1982) (holding that the \u201cinterpretation \nof regulations by declaratory ruling\u201d in an adjudication \nfalls \u201cwell within the scope of the familiar power of an \nagency\u201d); Sorenson Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.3d \n1215, 1223 (10th Cir. 2009). \nB. The government argues (at 31) that the Hobbs Act \nlacks an \u201cexception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules.\u201d But no \nexception is needed because, as our opening brief noted \n(at 40-42), interpretive rules by their very nature lack \u201cthe \n\n \n-21- \nforce and effect of law.\u201d Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, \n575 U.S. 92, 97 (2015). Such rules just \u201cadvise the public of \nthe agency\u2019s construction of the statutes and rules which \nit administers.\u201d Shalala v. Guernsey Mem\u2019l Hosp., 514 \nU.S. 87, 99 (1995). In part for this reason, every court of \nappeals to have considered the question (other than the \nNinth Circuit) has declined to read the Hobbs Act as \nbinding courts to interpretive rules. See Br. 41 (citing \ncases). Indeed, the government itself acknowledged at \noral argument in PDR Network that, because interpretive \nrules are \u201cwithout the force of law,\u201d they don\u2019t \u201cfall within \nthe Hobbs Act at all.\u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 64. \nTo hold otherwise would transform non-binding \nagency interpretations into permanently binding ones, \nrequiring courts to enforce them against parties who, \noutside of court, would not themselves be bound. But the \navailability of Hobbs Act review can no more transform a \nnon-binding order into a binding one than it can turn an \nagency\u2019s informal guidance memo or policy statement into \na formal rule. If Congress intended the mere availability \nof Hobbs Act review to imbue an agency\u2019s interpretative \ndecision with more binding force than the agency itself \nchose to give it, one would expect it to have said so clearly. \nThe mere absence of an express exception cannot, as the \ngovernment argues, establish that intent. \nIII. McKesson\u2019s alternative merits argument is not \npresented here. \nIn its final argument, McKesson contends (at 51) that, \n\u201c[r]egardless of whether Amerifactors is binding,\u201d this \nCourt should affirm on the ground that the FCC\u2019s order \n\u201cis correct\u201d on the merits. But if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nreading of the Hobbs Act is correct, the Act\u2019s grant of \nexclusive jurisdiction \u201cto determine the validity of\u201d an \n\n \n-22- \nagency order \u201cdivested the district court of jurisdiction to \nconsider the issue[],\u201d Wilson v. A.H. Belo Corp., 87 F.3d \n393, 399-400 (9th Cir. 1996)\u2014and, by extension, also \ndivested \u201cthis Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d on review, Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 88 (1998). On the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s view, this Court would thus lack subject-\nmatter jurisdiction either to \u201cagree[]\u201d or \u201cdisagree[]\u201d with \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation. Wilson, 87 F.3d at 399-400. In \nany event, as McKesson itself acknowledges (at 42), \u201cthe \nonly question before the Court is whether the Hobbs Act\u2019s \nreview is exclusive.\u201d Its argument that the order is \ncorrect\u2014like the government\u2019s preliminary argument \nthat it\u2019s not final\u2014was neither presented as a question in \nthe petition for certiorari nor fairly included therein.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a record of my own internal reasoning, reflecting on a failed search for the petitioner's reply brief and planning a new search strategy. This is a meta-cognitive, procedural observation; it contains no new external facts, evidence, or signals about the case itself. It merely confirms that a key piece of evidence\u2014the petitioner's reply brief\u2014remains missing. As such, my substantive beliefs about the case's merits and likely outcome are unchanged. My understanding remains grounded in the powerful influence of the Solicitor General's amicus brief.\n\n*   **Stable Core Belief:** The U.S. Solicitor General's amicus brief remains the most dispositive piece of evidence. Its argument that the Hobbs Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342) vests exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to FCC orders in the courts of appeals, thereby precluding district courts from entertaining such challenges, provides a strong basis for affirming the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of McKesson.\n\n*   **Stable Key Nuance:** The SG's brief offers the Court a procedural alternative to a broad merits ruling. By highlighting that the underlying FCC order (*Amerifactors*) is currently subject to an application for review before the full Commission (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7)), the SG raised the possibility that the order is not yet \"final\" for the purposes of Hobbs Act review. This gives the Court a narrow, case-specific path to either dismiss the writ as improvidently granted (DIG) or vacate and remand without setting a major precedent on the Hobbs Act's scope.\n\n*   **Stable Evaluation of Arguments:**\n    *   **Respondent's Position (Strong):** McKesson's argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to invalidate the FCC's interpretation is significantly bolstered by the SG's endorsement. The combined force of their arguments makes a ruling in their favor highly probable.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Weak):** McLaughlin's central claim\u2014that the Hobbs Act's exclusive review provisions do not apply to \"interpretive\" FCC orders\u2014is directly and persuasively countered by the SG's brief. This leaves their position substantially weakened.\n\n*   **Stable Prediction & Confidence:** My confidence remains high that the respondent, McKesson, will prevail. The probability distribution of outcomes is stable:\n    1.  **Affirmance (Broad Merits Ruling):** The most probable outcome. The Court formally adopts the reasoning that the Hobbs Act precludes collateral attacks on FCC orders in district courts.\n    2.  **Dismissal/Vacatur (Narrow Procedural Ruling):** A significant possibility. The Court uses the non-finality argument raised by the SG to avoid a precedential decision on the main legal question.\n    3.  **Reversal (for Petitioner):** Extremely unlikely, given the weight of the arguments from the respondent and the U.S. government.\n\n*   **Stable Remaining Uncertainty (Highlighted by Observation):** The primary uncertainty is not *if* the respondent will win, but *how* the Court will structure that win. The observation underscores that the petitioner's reply brief is the most critical missing piece of evidence. This brief represents the petitioner's only opportunity to rebut the SG's powerful arguments and, specifically, to address the procedural \"off-ramp\" concerning the finality of the *Amerifactors* order. Until that brief is located and analyzed, the choice between a broad merits affirmance and a narrow procedural disposition remains the key unresolved question.",

This thought action serves to (1) articulate the new state of uncertainty (Loper Bright-style judicial power vs. Hobbs Act jurisdictional channeling) and (2) formulate a precise, high-value plan to resolve it.

The thought's value lies in its strategic planning, which is essential for efficiently reducing uncertainty about the case outcome.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action provides a powerful, generalizable lesson in experimental design for legal prediction. It demonstrates the crucial strategy of actively mitigating confirmation bias. After being persuaded by a strong argument from one side, the agent immediately recognizes the need to 'steel-man' the opposition by consulting their primary brief. This principle\u2014testing a new, strong belief against the best available counter-evidence before solidifying it\u2014is a cornerstone of robust analysis and a key strategy for any BOED agent in an adversarial domain.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the petitioner's reply briefs, particularly the merits-stage brief, fundamentally alters my understanding of the case and shifts the likely outcome. My previous belief, anchored by the Solicitor General's amicus brief, that the respondent (McKesson) would almost certainly prevail is now substantially revised. The petitioner has mounted a powerful and sophisticated counter-argument that makes reversal a highly plausible, if not probable, outcome.\n\n*   **Shift in Core Belief:** The Solicitor General's brief is no longer the single most dispositive piece of evidence. The petitioner's merits reply brief has emerged as an equally powerful document that effectively reframes the entire dispute. The case is no longer a simple jurisdictional question but a battle over the fundamental role of the judiciary versus administrative agencies.\n\n*   **Revised Evaluation of Arguments:**\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Upgraded from Weak to Strong):** The petitioner's argument is far more robust than previously understood. They make several compelling points:\n        *   **Textual/Structural Argument:** They argue persuasively that the phrase \"determine the validity of\" in the Hobbs Act, when read in context with the surrounding words \"enjoin, set aside, suspend\" (*noscitur a sociis*), refers to a form of equitable relief (a declaratory judgment), not a blanket prohibition on district courts interpreting a statute in a private enforcement action. This reading avoids rendering other parts of the statute superfluous.\n        *   **Alignment with Judicial Philosophy:** Crucially, the petitioner links their argument to the Supreme Court's recent, landmark decision in *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*. By framing the issue as a defense of the judiciary's \"exclusive function\" to interpret statutes against agency overreach, they align their position with a dominant trend in the Court's current administrative law jurisprudence. This makes their argument particularly appealing to a majority of the current justices.\n        *   **Alternative Argument:** They present a strong fallback position: even if the Hobbs Act applies to some FCC orders, the *Amerifactors* order at issue is merely an \"interpretive rule\" that lacks the force of law and therefore cannot bind a district court in the first place.\n\n    *   **Respondent's/SG's Position (Still Plausible, but Weakened):** The argument for exclusive review in the courts of appeals remains a coherent position based on principles of jurisdictional channeling. However, the petitioner's reply brief exposes it as a broad interpretation that relies on dictionary definitions over statutory context and leads to what the petitioner frames as an \"abdication\" of judicial duty. The petitioner's citation of *Loper Bright* puts the respondent and the SG on the defensive, forcing them to argue against the Court's own recent pronouncements on judicial authority.\n\n*   **Reduced Likelihood of Procedural \"Off-Ramp\":** My prior belief highlighted the possibility of the Court using the non-finality of the FCC's *Amerifactors* order to issue a narrow procedural ruling. The petitioner's cert-stage reply directly confronts this, dismissing it as a \"theoretical possibility\" and a delay tactic. By challenging this escape hatch so directly, the petitioner makes it more difficult for the Court to avoid deciding the important question presented, for which it granted certiorari.\n\n*   **Revised Prediction & Confidence:** My confidence in a victory for the respondent has been significantly eroded. The probability distribution of outcomes has shifted dramatically.\n    1.  **Reversal (for Petitioner):** This is now the most probable outcome. The Court is likely to adopt the reasoning from Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network*, now bolstered by the logic of *Loper Bright*, and hold that the Hobbs Act does not prevent a district court in a private enforcement action from independently interpreting the TCPA.\n    2.  **Affirmance (for Respondent):** This remains a possible outcome but is now significantly less likely. It would require the Court to prioritize the jurisdictional channeling of the Hobbs Act over its recent trend of asserting judicial authority over agencies.\n    3.  **Dismissal/Vacatur (Narrow Procedural Ruling):** The probability of this outcome has decreased. The petitioner has effectively argued that this would be an evasion of a critical, recurring legal question.\n\n*   **Stable Uncertainty (Refined):** The core uncertainty has shifted. It is no longer *how* the respondent will win, but rather which legal principle the Court will prioritize: the orderly, exclusive review scheme of the Hobbs Act, or the fundamental principle, recently re-emphasized in *Loper Bright*, that it is \"emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" The petitioner's reply brief has successfully framed the case as a referendum on the latter.",

It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.

First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

(footnote omitted).\nActing on delegated authority, the FCC\u2019s Consumer \nand Governmental Affairs Bureau decided the petition \nafter notice and comment.  Pet. App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 48a (citing Rules & Reguls. Implementing \nthe Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, \n14133 \u00b6200 (2003)).\nThe Bureau\u2019s plain reading of the text was reinforced \nby the TCPA\u2019s purposes.

It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet.

App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet.

The Ninth Circuit \ndid not characterize Amerifactors as an interpretive \nrule\u2014or any rule at all.  Instead, the court treated the \nAmerifactors order as an adjudication.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIt noted that the FCC Bureau had acted pursuant to 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).  Pet. App. 9a.  That provision authorizes \nthe Bureau to \u201cissue a declaratory ruling terminating a \ncontroversy or removing uncertainty.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a). \nThe court further observed that the APA characterizes \ndeclaratory rulings as adjudications.  Pet. App. 9a (citing \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e)); see Central Texas Tel. Co-op., Inc. v. \nFCC, 402 F.3d 205, 210 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (FCC declaratory \norder proceedings are adjudications).

Nor could \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision here be part of any such \nsplit, given that it is non-precedential (and does not even \ncite PDR Network).  \nB. Regardless, Revisiting The Hobbs Act Question \nWould Be Premature\nAlthough PDR Network did not resolve the question \npresented there, the Court\u2014in both the majority opinion \nand Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence\u2014provided guid-\nance for lower courts about what factors may be relevant \nand how to approach the Hobbs Act question.  Given the \nrecency of that decision and the relatively small number \nof cases that present the question, the courts of appeals \nhave just begun to react to and apply that guidance.  Cer-\nWLRUDUL\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003SUHPDWXUH\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003JLYLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXUWV\u0003\nof appeals an opportunity to fully consider PDR Network.\nThe cases petitioner cites for its supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split illustrate this prematurity.  Three of those \ncases make passing references to PDR Network only \nin a footnote.  Panzarella v. Navient Sol., Inc., 37 F.4th \n867, 873 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022); Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 \nEnd, Inc., 997 F.3d 470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021); Golan v. \nFreeEats.com, Inc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019). \nIt is unsurprising that these courts did not meaningfully \nengage with the Hobbs Act question or the guidance in \n\n16\nPDR Network because the issue would not have been \noutcome-determinative in any of those cases.  All three \ncourts agreed with the FCC\u2019s interpretation, so it did not \nmatter whether they were bound by it.  See, e.g., Golan, \n930 F.3d at 960 n.8 (\u201cOur decision is not implicated by the \nrecent Supreme Court opinion in PDR Network.\u201d).  In fact, \nfar from adopting the rule petitioner claims, the Second \nCircuit expressly stated that the status of FCC orders \nremained \u201can open question\u201d and that it \u201cneed not decide \nthat question here.\u201d  Gorss Motels, 997 F.3d at 477 n.4.\nIf the Court wants to revisit PDR Network, it should \nat least wait for the courts of appeals to digest and act on \nits prior guidance, so it can reconsider the question with \nWKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003WKRVH\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003GHFLVLRQV\u0011\u0003\u0003\nII.

The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held Petitioner \nCould Not Collaterally Attack The FCC Bureau\u2019s \nOrder\n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the district \ncourt \u201cwas bound by the Federal Communication Commis-\nsion\u2019s Amerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined \nthat the TCPA does not apply to faxes received through \n\n17\nan online fax service.\u201d  Pet.

The second \nwould be review by a court of appeals on a petition for \nreview under the Hobbs Act.  A plaintiff whose claims \ndepend on a determination that the FCC\u2019s interpretation \nof the statute is wrong may not circumvent that exclusive \npath by inviting a district court to make its own deter-\nmination.\n2. In support of petitioner\u2019s position on the merits, it \nrepeatedly invokes PDR Network and Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s \nopinion concurring in the judgment.  E.g., Pet. 1, 2, 20.  But \nit fails to acknowledge that case\u2019s fundamental difference. \nThere, a TCPA defendant argued that, notwithstand-\ning the Hobbs Act, it had a right to defend itself from \nliability under an erroneous interpretation of a statute. \n\n18\nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 6.  Here, by contrast, the agency \nentrusted by Congress to interpret and enforce the TCPA \nhas said that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is correct.  It \nis the TCPA plaintiff that seeks to circumvent Hobbs Act \nreview of that determination to expand the defendants\u2019 \nliability.\n7KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003OLQH\u0003RI\u0003-XVWLFH\u0003.DYDQDXJK\u00b7V\u0003VHSDUDWH\u0003RSLQLRQ\u0003\nLGHQWL\u00c0HG\u0003WKH\u0003LVVXH\u0003KH\u0003ZDV\u0003DGGUHVVLQJ\u001d\u0003\u0003\u00b40D\\\u0003defendants in \ncivil enforcement actions under the Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act contest the Federal Communications Com-\nmission\u2019s interpretation of the Act?\u201d  Id. at 10-11 (empha-\nsis added).  And his opinion repeatedly emphasized the \ndefendant-centered question before the Court.  See, e.g., \nid. at 12 (\u201cI would conclude that the Hobbs Act does not \nbar a defendant in an enforcement action from arguing \nthat the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d); \nid. at 12 (\u201cThe general rule of administrative law is that \nin an enforcement action, a defendant may argue that \nan agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong, at least \nunless Congress has expressly precluded the defendant \nfrom advancing such an argument.\u201d); id. at 14 (\u201cThe ques-\ntion for us is whether the Hobbs Act bars defendants in \nthose enforcement actions from arguing that the agency \nincorrectly interpreted the statute.

That background principle formed the \nbasis of the \u201cdefault rule\u201d that he applied to statutes he \ncategorized as \u201csilent about review in subsequent enforce-\nment actions\u201d:  \u201cIn those enforcement actions, the defen-\ndant may argue that the agency\u2019s interpretation is wrong.\u201d \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 15.  But neither he nor the PDR \nNetwork majority cited any such principle under which a \nplaintiff in such an enforcement action may do the same. \nJustice Kavanaugh\u2019s emphasis on defendants\u2019 rights \nalso implicated a \u201cconstitutional issue\u201d:  \u201cBarring defen-\ndants in as-applied enforcement actions from raising \narguments about the reach and authority of agency rules \nHQIRUFHG\u0003DJDLQVW\u0003WKHP\u0003UDLVHV\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHVWLRQV\u0003XQGHU\u0003\nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.  He explained that this \nconstitutional concern counseled in favor of \u201cthe default \nrule\u201d allowing defendants to make such arguments.  Ibid.\n\n20\nIn contrast, allowing plaintiffs to challenge an agen-\ncy\u2019s interpretation that limits liability for defendants \nwould disrupt the statutory scheme.  Congress provided \nfor both FCC and private enforcement of the TCPA.  See \nMims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n374 n.4 (2012) (noting that FCC may initiate civil actions \nand impose forfeitures for violations of the statute and \nits regulations).  In such FCC enforcement actions, the \nagency would not be permitted to impose liability based \non an interpretation of the statute the agency had ex-\npressly rejected. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n567 U.S. 239, 253-254 (2012) (penalizing regulated entity \nfor non-compliance with new, more expansive interpreta-\ntion of prohibited conduct violates due process).  It makes \nsense that an enforcement action brought by a private \nindividual would be subject to the same limitation.5\nB. The TCPA Does Not Prohibit Fax Advertisements \nSent To Online Fax Services\nWhether or not Amerifactors is binding, it is correct. \nAs the Fourth Circuit recently held, the TCPA\u2019s plain \n5.  Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), \ncasts no doubt on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding.  Loper Bright \ninvolved the standard that courts apply when reviewing an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute\u2014not which court is the proper \none to conduct such review.  Loper Bright held that \u201ccourts need \nnot and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of \nthe law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d  Id. at 2273.  Should \nthe full FCC decide the Amerifactors application for review and \nshould a party challenge that decision in a court of appeals under \nthe Hobbs Act, Loper Bright will control that court\u2019s review.  This \ncase involves the different question of whether a TCPA plaintiff \ncan circumvent the Hobbs Act by effectively seeking such review \nin a district court.\n\n21\nlanguage shows that Congress did not extend the statu-\ntory prohibition to advertisements sent to online fax \nservices.

THIS CASE IS A POOR VEHICLE FOR \nRESOLVING THE QUESTION PRESENTED\nPetitioner pitches this case as the \u201cideal vehicle to \nresolve the question presented, but left undecided, in \nPDR Network.\u201d  Pet. 2.  But this case is different from \nPDR Network for multiple reasons, and each one poses a \nVLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003SUREOHP\u0011\u0003\u0003,I\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003ZDQWV\u0003WR\u0003UHYLVLW\u0003\nthe question presented in PDR Network, it should wait \nfor another case to do so. \nA. The Due Process Concerns Present In PDR \nNetwork Are Absent Here\nAs noted above, there is a fundamental differ-\nence between PDR Network and this case.  See supra \npp. 17-20.  In PDR Network, the plaintiff invoked a favor-\nable FCC order and argued the defendant could not chal-\nlenge it.  This case presents the opposite situation.  It is \nthe defendants who invoke a favorable FCC order and \nargue it is binding.\nThat difference means that the reasoning and con-\ncerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence \nin PDR Network are inapplicable here.  PDR Network \nimplicated the traditional principle that a defendant can \ntypically defend itself in an enforcement action by con-\ntending that a regulation is invalid.  To hold otherwise, \nJustice Kavanaugh wrote, would raise serious due process \nconcerns.  See supra pp. 19-20.  Petitioner points to no \ncomparable traditional principle that allows plaintiffs to \nattack an agency determination to expand the scope of \ndefendants\u2019 liability.  Limiting plaintiffs\u2019 ability to do so \nimplicates none of the due process concerns Justice Ka-\nvanaugh expressed.\n\n28\nTo answer the question that was presented in PDR \nNetwork, the Court should await a case where the plain-\ntiff invokes the Hobbs Act to prevent a defendant from \nchallenging an FCC order that the defendant contends \nexpands its liability beyond what the statute allows.\nB. The FCC Proceeding At Issue Is Ongoing \nThe FCC order here was issued by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau on delegated \nauthority.  Pet. App. 57a.  An application for review of that \norder remains pending with the full FCC.  Pet. App. 8a \nn.1.  When the FCC decides that application for review, its \ndecision will then be reviewable under the Hobbs Act in a \ncourt of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).\nThe ongoing FCC proceedings make this case differ-\nent from PDR Network, where the relevant FCC order \n(by the full Commission) had issued many years before \nthe relevant private-party litigation.  588 U.S. at 3.  The \nprovisional nature of the FCC order here poses several \nproblems for review.\n1. \nA decision by the FCC while this case \nis pending could prevent the Court from \nreaching the question presented\nBecause FCC proceedings are ongoing, the Commis-\nsion could decide the pending application for review before \nthis Court issued its decision on the merits.  And which-\never side lost before the full Commission could then seek \nHobbs Act review of that decision in a court of appeals.\n\n29\nThe outcome of those further administrative (and \npossibly judicial) proceedings could fundamentally change \nthe nature of this case and hinder this Court\u2019s ability to \nanswer the question presented.  For example, it is not \nclear what would happen if the full Commission were to \ngrant the application for review and reverse the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order.  Under those circumstances, the FCC \norder on which respondents and the court of appeals relied \nwould no longer be in force, but a new order favoring \npetitioner would be.  \nOr if a court of appeals sets aside the full FCC\u2019s order \nduring the pendency of this case in this Court, there \nwould then be no FCC order at issue.  And a different \nquestion\u2014decided by the Ninth Circuit in an appeal ear-\nlier in this case\u2014could be presented:  is the decision of a \nHobbs Act court setting aside an FCC order binding on \nanother court deciding a dispute between private parties? \nSee True Health Chiropractic, 896 F.3d at 930 (answering \nyes); accord Gorss Motels, Inc. v. FCC, 20 F.4th 87, 96 (2d \nCir. 2021); Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. ASD Specialty \nHealthcare, Inc., 863 F.3d 460, 467-468 (6th Cir. 2017).\nThese and other scenarios made possible by Ameri-\nfactors\u2019 pendency greatly increase the risk of a dismissal \nRI\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003LPSURYLGHQWO\\\u0003JUDQWHG\u000f\u0003D\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003RI\u0003\nmootness, or a remand to the Ninth Circuit based solely \non Amerifactors-related developments.  Any of those out-\ncomes would prevent the Court from reaching the question \npresented.  This risk can be eliminated if the Court waits \nto revisit the PDR Network question in a case in which \nthe FCC order was issued by the full Commission and is \nno longer subject to judicial review.\n\n30\n2. \nStrategic decisions by petitioner and its \ncounsel in the FCC proceedings could \npreclude challenging the FCC\u2019s order, \nindependent of the Hobbs Act \nPetitioner made a strategic choice not to participate \nin the administrative proceeding whose (interim) outcome \nit now complains about.  But its attorneys in their own \nnames are participating in a related FCC proceeding pre-\nsenting the same question.  See supra pp. 8-9 (discussing \nRyerson).  Both those circumstances distinguish this case \nfrom PDR Network and render it an unappealing vehicle \nfor consideration of the question presented.\nIn PDR Network, the relevant FCC decision came \nseven years before the fax advertisements at issue.  588 \nU.S. at 3.  This Court noted that the APA \u201cprovides that \n\u2018agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement\u2019 except \u2018to \nthe extent that [a] prior, adequate, and exclusive oppor-\ntunity for judicial review is provided by law.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 7 \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703) (emphasis by Court).

Pet. App. 46a; see supra p. 8.  \nPetitioner easily could have participated in the FCC \nproceedings\u2014and could have asked for a stay of the dis-\ntrict court litigation while it did so.  See, e.g., Advanced \nRehab & Med., P.C. v. Amedisys Holding, LLC, No. 1:17-\nCV-1149, 2022 WL 1555240, at *2 (W.D. Tenn. May 17, 2022) \n(staying class action \u201cpending resolution of the applica-\ntion for review of the Amerifactors determination\u201d).  Its \nstrategic decision not to do so should bar it from seeking \na different answer here\u2014regardless of whether FCC \ndeterminations are more broadly binding in private-party \nlitigation.  See Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n, \n400 U.S. at 72.  When a party\u2019s \u201cinterests [are] clearly at \nstake\u201d in an administrative proceeding and it \u201chad every \nopportunity to participate\u201d in them and then \u201cseek timely \nreview in the Court of Appeals\u201d but \u201cchose not to do so,\u201d \u201cit \ncannot force collateral redetermination of the same issue \nin a different and inappropriate forum.\u201d  Ibid.  That rule\u2014\nwhich Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence did \nnot mention, much less suggest was incorrect\u2014should \nprevent petitioner from challenging Amerifactors\u2019s con-\nclusion independent of the Hobbs Act, thus again leaving \nthe broader PDR Network question unresolved.\nAt the same time, the participation by petitioner\u2019s \ncounsel as a party in the ongoing Ryerson proceedings \nat the FCC raises a different problem.  In PDR Network, \nJustice Kavanaugh noted that a party that \u201cchallenges \n6.

To be sure, petitioner here has not par-\nticipated in Ryerson.  But its counsel has\u2014not on behalf \nof some other client, but in counsel\u2019s own name.  And it did \nso for a stated representational reason:   counsel advised \nthe FCC that it \u201crepresents clients across the country in \nprivate litigation\u201d in TCPA cases and that the FCC\u2019s deci-\nsion could impact them.  Anderson + Wanca Comments, \nsupra, at 1.  And all of counsel\u2019s Ryerson\u0003\u00c0OLQJV\u0003RFFXUUHG\u0003\nconcurrently with the district court litigation here; indeed, \nFRXQVHO\u0003\u00c0OHG\u0003LWV\u0003Ryerson application for review arguing \nthat Amerifactors was wrongly decided while respondents\u2019 \nmotion to decertify the class based on Amerifactors was \npending.  See supra pp. 8-9.\nA prior decision can be the basis for issue preclusion \neven as to non-parties in a variety of circumstances, \nincluding when there is a \u201cpre-existing substantive legal \nrelationship between the person to be bound and a party \nto the judgment\u201d and where the nonparty was \u201cadequately \nrepresented by someone with the same interests who \nwas a party.\u201d  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 894 (2008) \n(quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Here, counsel \nand petitioner had a preexisting legal relationship and \ncounsel adequately represented petitioner\u2019s interests \nas to the online-fax-service issue when it participated in \nRyerson.  It is thus possible that normal preclusion prin-\nciples would bind petitioner to the result in Ryerson.  See \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring); cf. Ferris v.

There Is A Mismatch Between The Question \nPresented And The Decision Below\nPetitioner\u2019s principal argument in the district court \nand court of appeals was that Amerifactors was not binding \nunder the Hobbs Act because it was a bureau-level deci-\nsion.  Pet. CA Principal & Resp. Br. 30-33.  It limited the \nbroader argument it now makes to a footnote in its merits \nbrief and to its rehearing petition.  Pet. CA Principal & \nResp. Br. 32 n.4; Pet. CA Reh\u2019g Pet.  This would impede the \nCourt\u2019s review of the question now presented in two ways.\nFirst, as a result of how petitioner briefed the case \nbelow, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s unpublished memorandum did \nnot engage on the broader question or even cite PDR \nNetwork.  Instead, it addressed only the argument it \nunderstood petitioner to be making\u2014that the Bureau\u2019s \nRUGHU\u0003ZDV\u0003QRW\u0003D\u0003\u00b4\u00c0QDO\u0003RUGHU\u00b5\u0003IRU\u0003SXUSRVHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003+REEV\u0003\nAct.  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet petitioner does not seek review of \nthat question, so there is a mismatch between the deci-\nsion below and the question petitioner wants this Court to \nGHFLGH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003GHQLHV\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003WKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003\ndecision to review that addresses the question in light \nof PDR Network.  The Court generally does not grant \ncertiorari in that situation.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 \nU.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not \nRI\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003YLHZ\u0011\u00b5\f\u0011\n7.  Respondents had no reason to raise these complications \nbelow because petitioner did not make the argument it is pressing \nhere, and no decision has yet triggered preclusion.  See infra Part \nIII.C.\n\n34\nSecond, petitioner nowhere disclaims the argument it \nmade to the court of appeals.  If petitioner\u2019s merits brief \nwere to revive that argument involving the bureau-level \nnature of the FCC order, the case could end up focused on \nthat idiosyncrasy.  Again, this possibility for distraction \nmakes this a poor vehicle for review.\n'\u0011\u0003 $Q\u0003$OWHUQDWLYH\u0003*URXQG\u0003)RU\u0003$I\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003%DVHG\u0003\nOn The Plain Statutory Text Makes This A \nPoor Vehicle\n$Q\u0003REYLRXV\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u00b3WKH\u0003\nFCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute is plainly correct as a \nde novo matter\u2014could prevent the Court from deciding \nthe question presented.  \nAs discussed above, respondents have argued all \nalong that the statute plainly does not cover online fax \nservices, and they would make that argument again as \nDQ\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003LI\u0003FHUWLRUDUL\u0003ZHUH\u0003\ngranted.

That was so because it was \n\u00b4VDWLV\u00c0HG\u0003WR\u0003UXOH\u00b3GH\u0003QRYR\u00b3WKDW\u0003SXUVXDQW\u0003WR\u0003LWV\u0003SODLQ\u0003\nstatutory language, the TCPA prohibits the sending of \nunsolicited advertisements to what the district court \nlabelled as \u2018stand-alone fax machines,\u2019 but not to what the \ncourt accepted to be \u2018online fax services.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  That \nsame path of least resistance is present here.  \nAnd were this Court to disregard the statutory ques-\ntion and reverse the Ninth Circuit on the Hobbs Act, \nthat court on remand would then likely come to the same \nconclusion based on the plain statutory text.  If the Court \nwants to address the Hobbs Act question, it should await \na case where it might matter to the ultimate outcome.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nRespectfully submittted,\nDEANNE E.

          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has been significantly refined by the petitioner's merits reply brief, which presented a powerful case for reversal that appears tailored to the current Supreme Court's administrative law jurisprudence. However, the latest observation\u2014an internal reflection on my reasoning process\u2014introduces a critical layer of metacognitive awareness and tempers my confidence.\n\n*   **Reinforced Strength of Petitioner's Argument:** My belief that the petitioner has presented a very strong case for reversal remains intact. Their framing of the issue as a defense of the judiciary's role in statutory interpretation against agency overreach, directly invoking the logic of *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, is a sophisticated and likely effective strategy. The textual argument (*noscitur a sociis*) that \"determine the validity of\" in the Hobbs Act refers to a form of equitable relief, not a blanket jurisdictional bar on interpretation in private enforcement actions, remains a compelling core of their position.\n\n*   **Newly Acknowledged Information Gap (Crucial Update):** The latest observation forces me to recognize that my current strong leaning towards the petitioner is based on an incomplete, one-sided view. I have analyzed the petitioner's arguments and their *characterization* of the respondent's and Solicitor General's arguments. I have not yet analyzed the primary source documents for the opposing side. This is a significant blind spot. The strength of any argument is relative to the counter-arguments, which I have not yet directly assessed.\n\n*   **Revised Confidence & Prediction:** My confidence in a reversal for the petitioner is now explicitly qualified. It is a leading hypothesis, but a provisional one. The probability distribution I previously calculated (favoring reversal) is now held with lower confidence pending review of the opposition's briefs.\n    1.  **Reversal (for Petitioner):** Remains the most likely outcome *based on current information*, but this assessment is vulnerable to change.\n    2.  **Affirmance (for Respondent):** The probability of this outcome cannot be accurately assessed until I understand how the respondent and the SG counter the petitioner's *Loper Bright*-centric argument and defend the jurisdictional-channeling interpretation of the Hobbs Act.\n    3.  **Dismissal/Vacatur:** The probability remains low, as previously assessed.\n\n*   **Refined Uncertainty:** My uncertainty has evolved. It is no longer just a question of which high-level legal principle the Court will favor. It is now a more concrete and immediate uncertainty:\n    *   How does the respondent's merits brief directly rebut the petitioner's textual and structural arguments?\n    *   How do the respondent and the Solicitor General address the precedent of *Loper Bright*? Do they distinguish it, argue it's irrelevant, or attempt to co-opt its logic?\n    *   What affirmative case do they make for why the Hobbs Act's jurisdictional channeling must apply even in private enforcement actions where a party is not seeking to \"enjoin, set aside, [or] suspend\" an agency order?\n\nIn essence, my understanding has progressed from seeing a likely winner to understanding *why* that party appears to be winning, and now, to recognizing the critical need to test that hypothesis against the best arguments from the other side. The next most informative pieces of evidence are unequivocally the respondent's brief on the merits and the Solicitor General's amicus brief.",
