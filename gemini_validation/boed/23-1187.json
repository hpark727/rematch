    "facts_of_the_case": "R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company manufactures e-cigarettes, including the popular menthol- and mixed-berry-flavored Vuse Alto products. When the FDA announced in 2016 that e-cigarettes would be regulated as \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d under the Tobacco Control Act, RJR Vapor timely applied for authorization to continue marketing its Vuse Alto products. Three years later, the FDA denied the applications, finding that RJR Vapor had failed to demonstrate that marketing these products would be \u201cappropriate for the protection of the public health.\u201d Rather than challenging the denial alone in either the D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit (where it could properly file), RJR Vapor joined with retailers to file a joint petition in the Fifth Circuit: Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (a Texas company operating a Vuse store in Houston), the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association, and another RJR corporate affiliate that sold Vuse products online.\n\nThe FDA moved to dismiss the joint petition for lack of venue or alternatively to transfer it to the D.C. Circuit or Fourth Circuit, arguing that only disappointed applicants\u2014not retailers\u2014are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by denial orders under the Tobacco Control Act and thus have the right to seek judicial review. A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the FDA\u2019s motion, concluding that venue was proper because the retailers were \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the denial order and could properly petition for review.",

The central legal question is one of statutory interpretation: whether retailers are 'adversely affected' under the Tobacco Control Act and thus have standing to seek judicial review of an FDA marketing denial order issued to a manufacturer. This is a question of standing. To make an informed prediction, I need to understand the arguments of both the petitioner (FDA) and the respondent (R.J. Reynolds and the retailers). The most direct way to do this is to examine the briefs filed in the case. I will start by searching for the petitioner's brief to understand the government's argument for why the Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed. This will provide the statutory text in question, the government's interpretation, and the key precedents they rely on.

The real task-specific information gain will come from executing the plan (i.e., searching for the brief). However, the action has significant Design EIG. The thought process articulates a clear, logical, and highly effective general strategy for SCOTUS case analysis: 1) deconstruct the legal question, 2) identify the need to understand both parties' arguments, and 3) prioritize reading the petitioner's brief as the starting point. This is a fundamental and reusable workflow for any case, and explicitly stating it provides valuable information about what constitutes an effective prediction strategy (D). The joint EIG reflects that while this step is crucial for setting up future high-gain actions, its primary value at this moment is in demonstrating a sound methodological approach.",

This action directly targets that knowledge gap for one of the two parties. Retrieving the petitioner's (FDA's) brief is a foundational step in understanding the case. It will provide the precise textual, structural, and precedential arguments the government is making to persuade the Court. This information is critical for moving from a general understanding of the legal issue to a specific analysis of how different judicial philosophies on the Court might engage with the arguments. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high, as this action will cause a massive update to my belief state about the likely outcome. The Design EIG is moderate. While reading the petitioner's brief is a known, fundamental step in SCOTUS prediction, executing this action and observing its utility provides strong evidence to confirm and refine this core strategy. It helps calibrate the importance of this step relative to others (e.g., reading amicus briefs or the respondent's brief) in my general predictive model.",

The beliefs are well-structured and internally consistent, showing clear integration of facts and legal framing, justifying a high coherence rating (0.85). The information density is substantial, covering multiple relevant aspects and framing the problem comprehensively, but not exhaustively, leading to a solid 0.7 rating.

L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, re-\nquires a person to obtain authorization from the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) before introducing a \nnew tobacco product into interstate commerce.  If FDA \ndenies an application for authorization, \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected by such  * * *  denial may file a petition \nfor judicial review of such  * * *  denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The \nquestion presented is:  \nWhether a manufacturer may file a petition for re-\nview in a circuit (other than the D.C.

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \nOPINION BELOW \nThe order of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-8a) is \nunreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 2, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 1a-15a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \n\n2 \n \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA), to regulate tobacco products.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 393(d)(2).  The Act applies automatically to some \ntobacco products, such as cigarettes, but other products \nbecome subject to it only once FDA issues a rule that \n\u201cdeems\u201d the product \u201cto be subject to\u201d the Act.  21 \nU.S.C. 387a(b). \nAs relevant here, the Act restricts the marketing of \n\u201cnew tobacco product[s]\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products that \nwere not commercially marketed in the United States \nas of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A manu-\nfacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into in-\nterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization from \nFDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2).   \nA manufacturer seeking marketing authorization \nmust file an application with FDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(b).  \nAfter reviewing the application, FDA must issue either \nan \u201corder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \nan \u201corder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d \ninto interstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  The \nagency must deny an application unless the applicant \nshows that the product would be \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).   \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the denial in accordance with the Administrative \n\n3 \n \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \n2. This case involves the application of the Act to \nelectronic nicotine delivery systems, which are com-\nmonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes.  See Office of the \nSurgeon General, U.S. Public Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs., E-Cigarette Use Among \nYouth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon Gen-\neral 3 (2016).  An e-cigarette is a battery-powered device \nthat heats a nicotine solution, or \u201ce-liquid,\u201d converting \nthe solution into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user then inhales.  See id. at 11.   \nBecause Congress did not list e-cigarettes among the \nproducts to which the Act automatically applied, they \nwere not at first subject to regulation under the Act.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387a(b).  But in 2016, FDA issued a rule \ndeeming e-cigarettes and e-liquids to be subject to the \nAct.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, \n2016).  Because e-cigarettes had generally not been on \nthe market as of February 15, 2007, they are new to-\nbacco products under the Act, and FDA\u2019s deeming rule \nmeant that they could lawfully be marketed only after \nreceiving agency authorization.  See Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, \n144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \nIn 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy regard-\ning certain e-cigarettes.  See Center for Tobacco Prods., \nFDA, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., Enforce-\nment Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Sys-\ntems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Mar-\nket Without Premarket Authorization (Revised) (Apr. \n2020).  FDA stated that it intended to prioritize enforce-\nment action against certain categories of products: cer-\ntain flavored products, products for which the manufac-\n\n4 \n \nturer failed to take adequate measures to prevent mi-\nnors\u2019 access, products targeted to minors, and products \nfor which the manufacturer failed to submit an applica-\ntion by September 9, 2020.  See id. at 3.  For other e-\ncigarettes, FDA stated that it would \u201cexercise enforce-\nment discretion for up to one year pending FDA review, \nunless there is a negative action by FDA on such appli-\ncation.\u201d  Id. at 27.  FDA warned, however, that its guid-\nance \u201cdoes not in any way alter the fact that it is illegal \nto market any new tobacco product without premarket \nauthorization.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products.  See Pet. App. 13a.  \nReynolds is incorporated, and thus resides, in North \nCarolina, and it maintains its principal place of business \nin Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds \nVapor Co., Business Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. \n2022, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023). \nReynolds applied for authorization to market berry- \nand menthol-flavored e-cigarette products under the \nbrand name Vuse Alto.  See Pet. App. 3a.  FDA denied \nthe applications, finding that Reynolds had failed to \nshow that the products would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.  See id. at 9a-23a.   \n2. Reynolds sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n3a.  Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a petition \nfor review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See id. at 7a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting).  But those courts had already rejected the \nprincipal legal theory on which Reynolds relies here.  \nSee ibid.  Specifically, Reynolds claims that FDA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously by changing the evidentiary \nstandards for flavored e-cigarette products after manu-\n\n5 \n \nfacturers had submitted their applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The Fourth and D.C. Circuits previously re-\njected similar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 \n(4th Cir.); Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022). \nReynolds sought judicial review in the Fifth Circuit \ninstead.  See Pet. App. 3a.  A panel of that court had \nrejected a claim similar to that brought by Reynolds, \nsee Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, \n41 F.4th 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2022), but by the time Reyn-\nolds filed its petition for review, the court had vacated \nthat decision and granted rehearing en banc, see Wages \n& White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  The en banc court would eventually rule \nin favor of the e-cigarette manufacturers.  See Wages & \nWhite Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FD\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, re-\nquires a person to obtain authorization from the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) before introducing a \nnew tobacco product into interstate commerce.  If FDA \ndenies an application for authorization, \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected by such  * * *  denial may file a petition \nfor judicial review of such  * * *  denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The \nquestion presented is:  \nWhether a manufacturer may file a petition for re-\nview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it \nneither resides nor has its principal place of business, if \nthe petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts that is located within that circuit. \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 1 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 4 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nA retailer may not file a petition for review of an \nFDA order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nfor marketing authorization ......................................... 11 \n1.

App. 1a-8a) is \nunreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 2, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 1a-15a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \n\n2 \n \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA), to regulate tobacco products.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 393(d)(2).  The Act applies automatically to some \ntobacco products, such as cigarettes, but other products \nbecome subject to it only once FDA issues a rule that \n\u201cdeems\u201d the product \u201cto be subject to\u201d the Act.  21 \nU.S.C. 387a(b). \nAs relevant here, the Act restricts the marketing of \n\u201cnew tobacco product[s]\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products that \nwere not commercially marketed in the United States \nas of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A manu-\nfacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into in-\nterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization from \nFDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2).   \nA manufacturer seeking marketing authorization \nmust file an application with FDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(b).  \nAfter reviewing the application, FDA must issue either \nan \u201corder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \nan \u201corder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d \ninto interstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  The \nagency must deny an application unless the applicant \nshows that the product would be \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).   \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the denial in accordance with the Administrative \n\n3 \n \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \n2. This case involves the application of the Act to \nelectronic nicotine delivery systems, which are com-\nmonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes.  See Office of the \nSurgeon General, U.S. Public Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs., E-Cigarette Use Among \nYouth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon Gen-\neral 3 (2016).  An e-cigarette is a battery-powered device \nthat heats a nicotine solution, or \u201ce-liquid,\u201d converting \nthe solution into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user then inhales.  See id. at 11.   \nBecause Congress did not list e-cigarettes among the \nproducts to which the Act automatically applied, they \nwere not at first subject to regulation under the Act.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387a(b).  But in 2016, FDA issued a rule \ndeeming e-cigarettes and e-liquids to be subject to the \nAct.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, \n2016).  Because e-cigarettes had generally not been on \nthe market as of February 15, 2007, they are new to-\nbacco products under the Act, and FDA\u2019s deeming rule \nmeant that they could lawfully be marketed only after \nreceiving agency authorization.  See Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, \n144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \nIn 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy regard-\ning certain e-cigarettes.  See Center for Tobacco Prods., \nFDA, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., Enforce-\nment Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Sys-\ntems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Mar-\nket Without Premarket Authorization (Revised) (Apr. \n2020).  FDA stated that it intended to prioritize enforce-\nment action against certain categories of products: cer-\ntain flavored products, products for which the manufac-\n\n4 \n \nturer failed to take adequate measures to prevent mi-\nnors\u2019 access, products targeted to minors, and products \nfor which the manufacturer failed to submit an applica-\ntion by September 9, 2020.  See id. at 3.  For other e-\ncigarettes, FDA stated that it would \u201cexercise enforce-\nment discretion for up to one year pending FDA review, \nunless there is a negative action by FDA on such appli-\ncation.\u201d  Id. at 27.  FDA warned, however, that its guid-\nance \u201cdoes not in any way alter the fact that it is illegal \nto market any new tobacco product without premarket \nauthorization.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products.  See Pet. App. 13a.  \nReynolds is incorporated, and thus resides, in North \nCarolina, and it maintains its principal place of business \nin Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds \nVapor Co., Business Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. \n2022, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023). \nReynolds applied for authorization to market berry- \nand menthol-flavored e-cigarette products under the \nbrand name Vuse Alto.  See Pet. App. 3a.  FDA denied \nthe applications, finding that Reynolds had failed to \nshow that the products would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.  See id. at 9a-23a.   \n2. Reynolds sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n3a.  Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a petition \nfor review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See id. at 7a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting).  But those courts had already rejected the \nprincipal legal theory on which Reynolds relies here.  \nSee ibid.  Specifically, Reynolds claims that FDA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously by changing the evidentiary \nstandards for flavored e-cigarette products after manu-\n\n5 \n \nfacturers had submitted their applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The Fourth and D.C. Circuits previously re-\njected similar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 \n(4th Cir.); Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022). \nReynolds sought judicial review in the Fifth Circuit \ninstead.  See Pet. App. 3a.  A panel of that court had \nrejected a claim similar to that brought by Reynolds, \nsee Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, \n41 F.4th 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2022), but by the time Reyn-\nolds filed its petition for review, the court had vacated \nthat decision and granted rehearing en banc, see Wages \n& White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  The en banc court would eventually rule \nin favor of the e-cigarette manufacturers.  See Wages & \nWhite Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n386 (5th Cir. 2024), cert. granted, No. 23-1038 (oral ar-\ngument scheduled for Dec. 2, 2024). \nThree other entities joined Reynolds\u2019 Fifth Circuit \npetition: RJR Vapor Co., LLC; Avail Vapor Texas, \nLLC; and the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and \nConvenience Stores Association.  See C.A. Pet. for Re-\nview 1-4 (Oct. 12, 2023).  The first entity (a corporate af-\nfiliate of Reynolds) is based in North Carolina and sells \nVuse Alto products online.  See Pet. 5.  The second en-\ntity is a Texas company that runs a retail store that sells \nVuse Alto products.  See C.A. Pet. for Review 3.  The \nthird entity is a Mississippi trade association of gas sta-\ntions and convenience stores, which has members that \nsell Vuse Alto products.  See ibid.   \nReynolds and the other three entities (respondents \nin this Court) alleged that Avail and the Association\u2019s \nmembers \u201cwill no longer be able to sell\u201d Vuse products \n\n6 \n \nand \u201cwill have to dispose of [their] existing inventory\u201d \nnow that FDA has denied Reynolds\u2019 application.  C.A. \nPet. for Review 3.  Respondents argued that venue lies \nin the Fifth Circuit because Avail and the Association \nare both based there.  See ibid.  \u201cOut of an abundance \nof caution,\u201d however, respondents later filed a \u201cprotec-\ntive petition\u201d in the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. for Review at 3, \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-1298 (Oct. 27, \n2023).   \n3. FDA moved to dismiss the petition for review or \nto transfer it to the D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit.  \nSee C.A. Doc. 43, at 23 (Oct. 18, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit \ndenied the motion in an unpublished order.  See Pet. \nApp. 1a-8a.   \nThe Fifth Circuit had previously held, in considering \nanother petition for review filed by Reynolds and joined \nby the remaining respondents, that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit.\u201d  Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 188.  In the decision \nbelow, the court stated that it was bound by that hold-\ning.  See Pet. App. 4a.  Elaborating on the earlier deci-\nsion\u2019s reasoning, the court stated that, because the To-\nbacco Control Act allows \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d to challenge the denial of an application for mar-\nketing authorization, e-cigarette sellers may \u201cchallenge \nFDA decisions that affect them.\u201d  Ibid. (citation and em-\nphasis omitted).  The court also concluded that, because \n\u201ctwo of the [four] Petitioners\u201d \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business here in the Fifth Circuit,\u201d all four \ncould file a petition for review there.  Id. at 3a.  \nJudge Higginson dissented.  See Pet. App. 6a-8a.  He \nobserved that the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of the \nAct effectively nullifies its venue limitations.  See id. at \n6a-7a.  He also stated that the court\u2019s \u201cexpansive read-\n\n7 \n \ning of venue cannot seem to be reconciled with the other \nprovisions of the [Act].\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn a separate order, the court of appeals granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion to stay FDA\u2019s denial order pending \nresolution of the petition for review.  See C.A. Doc. 133, \nat 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  Judge Higginson dissented from \nthat order as well.  See id. at 3 n.*.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a retailer may \nchallenge the denial of a manufacturer\u2019s application.  It \nerred again in holding that the out-of-circuit manufac-\nturer may ride the local retailer\u2019s coattails to establish \nvenue.  The combination of those errors deprives the \nTobacco Control Act\u2019s venue restrictions of meaningful \neffect.  \nA.  Under the Tobacco Control Act, an \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d person may seek judicial review of an FDA or-\nder denying an application for marketing authorization.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \u201cAdversely affected\u201d is a term of \nart in administrative law.  It invokes the zone-of-interests \ntest, under which an entity may seek judicial review \nonly if the interest it asserts falls within the zone of in-\nterests protected by the statutory provision at issue.  \nA retailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the provision at issue\u2014the provision that \nrequires FDA to adjudicate an application for market-\ning authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(c).  The order that \nFDA issues at the end of that adjudication speaks to the \napplicant alone (always or nearly always a manufac-\nturer of the product) and affects retailers only indi-\nrectly.  And while the provision grants procedural \nrights to the applicant itself, it shows no similar solici-\ntude for retailers.  It does not allow retailers to partici-\npate in the proceedings, does not grant them any proce-\n\n8 \n \ndural rights, and does not require FDA to account for \ntheir substantive interests.   \nThe statute\u2019s structure confirms that non-applicant \nretailers lack the right to challenge denial orders.  The \nAct contains a confidentiality provision that shields \ntrade secrets and other sensitive information submitted \nas part of the application process.  Because of that pro-\nvision, retailers will not necessarily know that a manu-\nfacturer has filed an application or that the agency has \ndenied it.  Congress would not have granted retailers \nthe right to challenge denial orders in court while deny-\ning them the right to know that such orders had been \nentered and the right to see the information necessary \nto mount an effective challenge to FDA\u2019s conclusion \nthat the applicant failed to show that the product at issue \nwould be appropriate for the protection of public health.  \nThe Act, moreover, forbids the sale of a new tobacco \nproduct unless and until FDA authorizes the marketing \nof the product.  An order denying a manufacturer\u2019s ap-\nplication thus leaves a retailer\u2019s legal rights unchanged:  \nThe retailer has no right to sell the product before the \ndenial, and it still lacks that right after the denial.  The \nretailers in this case unlawfully sold Reynolds\u2019 Vuse \nAlto products before FDA had acted on Reynolds\u2019 ap-\nplications, but their unlawful conduct cannot generate a \nright to judicial review that they would otherwise lack. \nB.  The Fifth Circuit also erred in holding that an \nout-of-circuit manufacturer may join a local retailer \nwho seeks judicial review in the circuit.  The Act pro-\nvides that a person may file a petition for review in a \ncircuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) only if \u201csuch per-\nson\u201d resides or has its principal place of business there.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The text thus makes clear that a \nperson may sue in a circuit only if that person is based \n\n9 \n \nthere.  A manufacturer may not sue based on a retailer\u2019s \nresidence.  \nTraditional principles of joinder confirm that read-\ning.  Joinder is a procedural device that enables suits \nthat could have been brought separately to be brought \nand processed together, not a tool for expanding the \nparties\u2019 rights or the court\u2019s power.  Because Reynolds \nhad no right to file its own petition in the Fifth Circuit, \nit also had no right to join someone else\u2019s petition there.  \nThe same result follows from traditional principles \nof venue.  This Court has long held that, except when \nCongress provides otherwise, venue must be proper as \nto each party in a multi-party case.  \u201c[E]ach plaintiff \nmust be competent to sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant must be \nliable to be sued\u201d in the chosen forum.  Smith v. Lyon, \n133 U.S. 315, 319 (1890).  Nothing in the language of the \nAct departs from that default rule.  \nC.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation deprives the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions of meaningful effect and ena-\nbles their ready evasion.  Congress specified three ven-\nues where a person may sue.  But under the decision \nbelow, an applicant may sue in any regional circuit any-\nwhere in the country so long as it finds a local retailer \nwilling to join its petition.  This Court should not adopt \nsuch a self-defeating interpretation of the statute.   \nARGUMENT \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides as follows:  \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A)  the promulgation of a regulation under [21 \nU.S.C. 387g] establishing, amending, or revoking \na tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B)  a denial of an application under [21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)], \n\n10 \n \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That provision allows a person to \nfile a petition for review of an FDA denial order in one \nof three circuits: the D.C. Circuit, the circuit where it \nresides, or the circuit where it maintains its principal \nplace of business.  When, as here, a venue statute does \nnot define what counts as a residence, this Court usually \nholds that a domestic corporation resides in the State of \nits incorporation.  See, e.g., TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft \nFoods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 262 (2017); \nShaw v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U.S. 444, 449 (1892).  \nThe Fifth Circuit, however, has read the Tobacco \nControl Act\u2019s venue provision to mean that a manufac-\nturer that neither resides nor maintains its principal \nplace of business in the circuit may nonetheless file a \npetition for review there, so long as the petition is joined \nby a local seller of the manufacturer\u2019s products.  See \nPet. App. 3a.  Reynolds, a manufacturer based in the \nFourth Circuit, has invoked that theory to file three pe-\ntitions for review, including the petition at issue here, in \nthe Fifth Circuit.1  At least eight other out-of-circuit \nmanufacturers\u2014based in China, California, Florida, \nMichigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington\u2014\n \n1  See p. 5, supra; Pet. for Review at 3, R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. \nFDA, No. 23-60037 (5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023); Pet. for Review at 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023).   \n\n11 \n \nhave since relied on the same tactic to seek judicial re-\nview in the Fifth Circuit.2   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of the Act rests on two \nindependent errors.  First, the court erred in holding \nthat a retail seller may seek judicial review of an FDA \norder denying a manufacturer\u2019s application.  Second, \nthe court erred in holding that venue need be proper \nonly as to one party, rather than all the parties.  Those \ntwo errors, in combination, effectively nullify the Act\u2019s \nlimits on venue.  This Court should reverse the court of \nappeals\u2019 order and remand with instructions to transfer \nthe case to the D.C. Circuit.  See C.A. Doc. 80, at 38 (Oct. \n30, 2023) (stating that respondents prefer the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to the Fourth Circuit).  \nA. A Retailer May Not File A Petition For Review Of An \nFDA Order Denying A Manufacturer\u2019s Application For \nMarketing Authorization \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides that an \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d person may seek judicial review of an FDA or-\nder denying an application for marketing authorization.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).

Newport \nNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 \n(1995).  The APA authorizes judicial review at the behest \nof an \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d person.  5 U.S.C. \n702.  Many agency-specific statutes likewise use the \nterms \u201cadversely affected\u201d and \u201caggrieved,\u201d alone or in \ncombination, to designate those who may challenge \nagency action.  See Newport News, 514 U.S. at 126. \nThe terms \u201cadversely affected\u201d and \u201caggrieved\u201d in-\nvoke the zone-of-interests test.  See, e.g., Thompson v. \nNorth American Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011); \nLujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, \n886 (1990).  Under that test, a plaintiff may seek judicial \nreview only if its interests \u201cfall within the zone of inter-\nests protected by the law invoked.\u201d  Lexmark Interna-\ntional, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. \n118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted).   \n\u201c[T]he breadth of the zone of interests varies accord-\ning to the provisions of law at issue.\u201d  Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997); see Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n126 (\u201c[W]hat constitutes adverse effect or aggrieve-\nment varies from statute to statute.\u201d) (citation and em-\nphasis omitted).  In APA cases, the zone-of-interests \ntest is not \u201cespecially demanding.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. \nat 130 (citation omitted).  In that context, the Court has \n\u201cconspicuously included the word \u2018arguably\u2019 in the test \nto indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the \nplaintiff.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  That \u201clenient ap-\nproach\u201d preserves \u201cthe flexibility of the APA\u2019s omnibus \njudicial-review provision, which permits suits for viola-\ntions of numerous statutes of varying character.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThat lenient approach does not, however, carry over \nto other statutes.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  In \n\n13 \n \nnon-APA cases, a court should generally ask whether \nthe interest asserted by the plaintiff actually (rather \nthan just arguably) falls within the zone protected by \nthe statute.  See id. at 129.  As a result, \u201cwhat comes \nwithin the zone of interests  * * *  for purposes of  * * *  \nthe \u2018generous review provisions\u2019 of the APA may not do \nso for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163 (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA court should discern the breadth of the zone of  \ninterests\u2014or, said otherwise, identify the types of \nharms that qualify as adverse effects\u2014using the normal \ntools of statutory interpretation, including text, struc-\nture, and precedent.  See Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n127-136.  In this case, those tools show that a retailer \nmay not challenge an order denying a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for marketing authorization.   \n1. A retailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue \nIn applying the zone-of-interests test, a court should \nfocus on \u201cthe particular provision of law upon which the \nplaintiff relies,\u201d not on the \u201coverall purpose of the Act.\u201d  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 175-176.  The plaintiff must show \nthat its interest falls within the zone protected by \u201cthe \nstatutory provision whose violation forms the legal ba-\nsis for [the] complaint.\u201d  National Wildlife Federation, \n497 U.S. at 883.  Applying the test at a higher \u201clevel of \ngenerality\u201d risks depriving it \u201cof virtually all meaning.\u201d  \nAir Courier Conference of America v. American Postal \nWorkers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 529-530 (1991).   \nRespondents claim that FDA acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously in applying 21 U.S.C. 387j(c), the provision \nof the Tobacco Control Act directing the agency to act \non applications for marketing authorization.  See pp. 4-\n5, supra.  The judicial-review provision that they invoke \n\n14 \n \nauthorizes courts to review \u201ca denial of an application \nunder section 387j(c) of this title.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B) \n(emphasis added).  Respondents must therefore show \nthat Section 387j(c) protects not only the interests of the \napplicant itself, but also the interests of retail sellers of \nthe applicant\u2019s products.  Respondents cannot make \nthat showing.   \na. Section 387j(c) directs FDA to issue an \u201corder\u201d \nafter adjudicating an application.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A); \nsee 5 U.S.C. 551(6) (APA\u2019s definition of \u201corder\u201d).  Con-\ngress modeled administrative adjudications on court \nproceedings.  See Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 110 (2000).  \nLike a court order, an agency order ordinarily ad-\ndresses particular parties, not the \u201cworld at large.\u201d   \nRadiofone, Inc. v. FCC, 759 F.2d 936, 938 (D.C. Cir. \n1985) (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Under Section 387j(c), after \nevaluating an application, FDA must issue either \u201can \norder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \u201can \norder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d into \ninterstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  That or-\nder is issued to the applicant alone.  Because the order \nregulates only the applicant, the prohibition upon arbi-\ntrary and capricious decision-making in the issuance of \nthe order seeks to protect only the applicant.  It does \nnot seek to protect retailers, who are strangers to the \nadjudication. \nTo be sure, denial orders may have indirect conse-\nquences for retailers:  If a manufacturer lacks authori-\nzation to sell a product, retailers cannot lawfully obtain \nand resell it.  But that indirect effect does not entitle \nretailers to judicial review of FDA\u2019s decision on a man-\nufacturer\u2019s application.  Our legal system has long dis-\ntinguished between \u201caction that directly affects a citi-\nzen\u2019s legal rights\u201d and \u201caction that is directed against a \n\n15 \n \nthird party and affects the citizen only indirectly or in-\ncidentally.\u201d  O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, \n447 U.S. 773, 788 (1980); see Department of State v. \nMu\u00f1oz, 602 U.S. 899, 917-919 (2024); Legal Tender \nCases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871).  When agency action \u201cdi-\nrectly affects\u201d one person and \u201ccauses only a conse-\nquential detriment\u201d to a bystander, the bystander has a \nweak claim to judicial review\u2014especially when (as here) \nits interests can be \u201cadequately protected by the person \ndirectly affected.\u201d  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Commit-\ntee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 153-154 (1951) (Frankfur-\nter, J., concurring).  Indeed, a claim based on a \u201cderiv-\native\u201d harm is \u201cprecisely the sort of claim that the pru-\ndential standing doctrine\u201d (as the zone-of-interests test \nis sometimes known) \u201cis designed to foreclose.\u201d  Center \nfor Reproductive Law & Policy v. Bush, 304 F.3d 183, \n196 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J.). \nThis case, in addition, differs meaningfully from \ncases where this Court has held that a bystander may \nchallenge an agency order.  Although the Act provides \nfor review only of denials of applications, see 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1)(B), some other statutes authorize adversely \naffected or aggrieved persons to seek review of both \ngrants and denials of applications, see, e.g., 47 U.S.C. \n402(b)(6).  Such statutes may even allow \u201cpersons with \ninterests adverse to the winning party,\u201d such as \u201ccom-\npetitors,\u201d to challenge an agency order granting an ap-\nplication.  Radiofone, 759 F.2d at 939 (opinion of Scalia, \nJ.); see, e.g., FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, \n309 U.S. 470, 476-477 (1940).  Unlike competitors, how-\never, the retailers here are not adverse to the manufac-\nturer.  Their interests, rather, derive from the manufac-\nturer\u2019s and are \u201cadequately protected\u201d by the manufac-\nturer\u2019s own ability to seek review of the denial of its ap-\n\n16 \n \nplication.  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, 341 \nU.S. at 154 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  \nb. The rest of Section 387j\u2014the section establishing \nthe process for applying for marketing authorization\u2014\nconfirms that Section 387j(c) does not seek to protect \nretailers.  Section 387j authorizes an applicant to file an \napplication with FDA, see 21 U.S.C. 387j(b), and then \ndirects FDA to issue a decision after considering \u201cthe \ninformation submitted to [it] as part of the application,\u201d \n21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2).  Section 387j does not give retailers \nany role in that process.  It does not authorize them to \nintervene, to submit additional evidence, or to comment \non the agency\u2019s proposed action.   \nSection 387j also confers various procedural rights \nupon the applicant alone.  For example, \u201can applicant\u201d \nmay ask FDA to refer the application to a special scien-\ntific committee.  21 U.S.C. 387j(b)(2)(B).  FDA must \nserve its order on \u201cthe applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(e)(2).  \nAnd if FDA denies an application, it must, to the extent \npracticable, provide a \u201cstatement informing the appli-\ncant of the measures required to remove such applica-\ntion from deniable form\u201d\u2014measures that may include \n\u201cfurther research by the applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(3).  \nSection 387j, by contrast, grants no procedural rights to \nretailers.  Retailers have no right to make requests \nabout the processing of the application, no right to no-\ntice of the agency\u2019s order, no right to know the reasons \nfor a denial, and no right to know what changes could be \nmade to make the application grantable.  \nThe substantive standard that Section 387j requires \nFDA to apply likewise reveals no concern for retailers\u2019 \nparticular interests.  The agency may authorize the \nmarketing of a new tobacco product only if the applicant \nshows that authorization would be \u201cappropriate for the \n\n17 \n \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).  \nThe Act requires the agency, in applying that test, to \nweigh (1) the likelihood that the new product will help \nexisting smokers \u201cstop using\u201d tobacco products and  \n(2) the risk that the new product will prompt non- \nsmokers to \u201cstart using\u201d tobacco products.  21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)(4).  But the Act does not direct the agency to \nweigh any interests of potential retailers, such as the \nnew product\u2019s effects on their revenues.  \nIn sum, Section 387j requires FDA to issue an order \ndirected to the applicant, not to retailers.  It does not \ngive retailers a role in the agency process, does not \ngrant them any procedural protections, and does not re-\nquire the agency to consider their substantive interests.  \nIn fact, Section 387j does not mention retailers at all.  \nThe statutory text and context thus strongly suggest \nthat retailers\u2019 interests fall outside the zone of interests \nthat Section 387j(c) protects.  \nc. The contrary reading of the Act lacks an obvious \nstopping point.  This case involves retailers that have \npreviously sold the product at issue, but respondents\u2019 \nreasoning would seem to extend even further.  Taken to \nits logical conclusion, it would permit judicial review at \nthe behest of a retailer that has never sold the product \nbut would like to do so once the product is authorized.  \nIt would also permit review at the behest of a consumer \nwho uses the product\u2014or, for that matter, a consumer \nwho does not yet use it but would like to do so.  A court \nshould not lightly infer that an agency order directed to \na specific applicant may be challenged by such a broad \nclass of bystanders.  \nThe contrary reading would also allow a retailer (and \nperhaps a consumer) to file a petition for review without \nregard to the wishes of the unsuccessful applicant.  A \n\n18 \n \nretailer could seek judicial review even if the applicant \nprefers to drop the case (e.g., in favor of filing a new \napplication).  Or a retailer could insist on litigating in \none circuit even if the applicant prefers another one \nwhere it is permitted to file.  Allowing retailers and \nother bystanders to file their own challenges would thus \nundermine \u201cthe autonomy of those persons likely to be \nmost directly affected by [the agency\u2019s] order.\u201d  Valley \nForge Christian College v. Americans United for Sepa-\nration of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982). \n2. The structure of the statutory scheme confirms that \na retailer may not challenge an FDA order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application \nA court should always seek to interpret a statute \u201cas \na symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\u201d and to \n\u201cfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.\u201d  \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. \n120, 133 (2000) (citations omitted); see Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law 167 (2012).  Statutory \nstructure is especially relevant to the interpretation of \nthe term \u201cadversely affected.\u201d  Discerning which harms \nconstitute adverse effects often involves inferences \ndrawn from the nature of the \u201cstatutory scheme.\u201d  New-\nport News, 514 U.S. at 127 (citation omitted).  Here, sev-\neral features of the statutory framework confirm that a \nretailer lacks the right to challenge the denial of a man-\nufacturer\u2019s application.  \na. The Tobacco Control Act includes a provision that \nprotects \u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d \u201ctrade secrets and \ncommercial or financial information\u201d submitted by an \napplicant as part of the application process.  5 U.S.C. \n552(b)(4); see 21 U.S.C. 387f(c) (cross-referencing 5 \nU.S.C. 552(b)(4)).  The Act provides that such infor-\nmation \u201cshall be considered confidential and shall not \n\n19 \n \nbe disclosed,\u201d except in specified circumstances.  21 \nU.S.C. 387f(c).   \nBecause of the confidentiality provision, retailers \nand other members of the public will not necessarily \nknow that a manufacturer has applied for authorization \nto market a new tobacco product.  \u201c[T]he intent to mar-\nket a tobacco product that is not currently marketed is \noften considered confidential commercial information.\u201d  \n86 Fed. Reg. 55,300, 55,398 (Oct. 5, 2021).  FDA thus \ngenerally \u201cwill not publicly disclose the existence of an \napplication.\u201d  21 C.F.R. 1114.47(b)(1).   \nRetailers and other members of the public likewise \nwill not necessarily know that FDA has denied a partic-\nular manufacturer\u2019s application or what particular \nproduct was subject to agency adjudication.  \u201cEven af-\nter receipt of a marketing denial order,\u201d \u201cthe intent to \nmarket may still constitute confidential commercial in-\nformation.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. at 55,398.  When FDA denies \nan application, therefore, it limits public disclosures to \nnon-confidential information, such as the \u201ctobacco prod-\nuct category (e.g., cigarette),\u201d the \u201ctobacco product sub-\ncategory (e.g., filtered, combusted cigarette),\u201d and the \n\u201ccharacterizing flavor.\u201d  21 C.F.R. 1114.47(d).  Unless \nthe manufacturer has disclosed its intent to market the \nproduct, the agency does not identify the specific prod-\nuct for which marketing authorization was denied.  \nEven when the public knows that a manufacturer has \napplied for marketing authorization and that FDA has \ndenied the application, the confidentiality provision pre-\ncludes full disclosure of the contents of the application, \ndenial order, and agency record.  Here, for example, \nReynolds successfully moved to seal its filings in the \ncourt of appeals in order to protect \u201cconfidential and \nproprietary information concerning Vuse products\u2019 de-\n\n20 \n \nsign, components, and other highly sensitive technical \ndetails that have not been made available to the public.\u201d  \nC.A. Doc. 59, at 3.  It observed that \u201cFDA has repeat-\nedly recognized the need to prevent public disclosure of \nconfidential and sensitive information contained in sub-\nmissions like the Vuse applications.\u201d  Id. at 9. \nThe confidentiality provision reinforces retailers\u2019 \nlack of any right to seek judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n7a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  A person can seek judi-\ncial review only if it knows that a manufacturer has filed \nan application and that FDA has denied it.  There is no \nreason to think that Congress wanted a non-applicant \nretailer to be able to obtain judicial review if it could \nsomehow learn the non-public fact that an application \nhad been filed by someone else and had been denied in \nthe 30 days preceding the retailer\u2019s petition for review.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B). \nA person, moreover, can \u201cmake a considered decision \nwhether to seek judicial review\u201d only if it knows the \nagency\u2019s \u201creasons for the denial.\u201d  T-Mobile South, LLC \nv. City of Roswell, 574 U.S. 293, 304 (2015).  That is par-\nticularly true under the Tobacco Control Act, which in-\nstructs courts to review denials under the arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(b) (citing 5 \nU.S.C. 706(2)(A)).  It is implausible that Congress granted \nretailers a right to litigate record-intensive arbitrary-\nand-capricious challenges while denying them the right \nto see the administrative record.   \nb. The Tobacco Control Act\u2019s separate provisions \ngoverning sales of tobacco products support the conclu-\nsion that denial orders do not adversely affect retailers.  \nThose provisions make it unlawful to sell a new tobacco \nproduct unless and until FDA authorizes its marketing.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 331(c), 387b(6)(A).  Given those provi-\n\n21 \n \nsions, an order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nhas no effect on a retailer\u2019s legal rights or duties.  The \nretailer has no legal right to sell the unauthorized prod-\nuct before the denial order, and it still lacks that right \nafter the order.  Because a denial order leaves the re-\ntailer\u2019s legal position unchanged, the order does not \n\u201cadversely affect\u201d the retailer. \nA denial order, at most, affects a retailer\u2019s expecta-\ntions about the likelihood of FDA enforcement action.  \nUnder the enforcement policy in effect when Reynolds \nsubmitted its applications, FDA\u2019s enforcement priori-\nties included products for which marketing applications \nhad been denied.  See p. 4, supra.  But an increase in \nthe likelihood that FDA will enforce the law is not an \n\u201cadverse effect.\u201d  The scope of the term \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d depends on the statute\u2019s meaning when enacted, \nnot on FDA\u2019s post-enactment enforcement choices.  \nTreating a change in the odds of enforcement as a judi-\ncially cognizable harm would undermine the Executive \nBranch\u2019s exclusive Article II power to decide \u201chow to \nprioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions \nagainst defendants who violate the law.\u201d  United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 678 (2023) (citation omitted).   \nIn this case, the retailers explain that they have been \nselling Reynolds\u2019 Vuse Alto products since before FDA \nresolved Reynolds\u2019 applications.  See C.A. Pet. for Re-\nview 3.  They fear that, now that FDA has denied the \napplications, it will enforce the Act against them, so that \nthey \u201cwill no longer be able to sell\u201d the products.  Ibid.  \nBut those sales have violated the Act all along (even if \nthey were not identified as priorities for FDA enforce-\nment), and an interest in continuing to violate the law \nnecessarily falls outside the zone of interests that the \nlaw seeks to protect.  A retailer that has started unlaw-\n\n22 \n \nfully selling an unauthorized product may not seek ju-\ndicial review on the ground that a denial order reduces \nthe chances that FDA will continue to refrain from tak-\ning action against those violations.  Respondents\u2019 con-\ntrary argument runs up against \u201cthe basic notion that \nno court will lend its aid to one who founds a cause of \naction upon an  * * *  illegal act.\u201d  Paperworkers v. \nMisco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42 (1987); see Holman v. John-\nson, 98 Eng. Rep. 1120, 1121 (K.B. 1775) (Lord Mans-\nfield, L.C.J.) (\u201cIf, from the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s own stating or oth-\nerwise, the cause of action appears to arise  * * *  [from] \nthe transgression of a positive law of this country, there \nthe Court says he has no right to be assisted.\u201d).   \nc. Finally, the Act empowers FDA to withdraw a \ngrant of marketing authorization in some circumstances \n\u2014for instance, if it finds that \u201cthe continued marketing \nof [the] tobacco product no longer is appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(1)(A).  \nThe Act provides that the \u201cholder of an application\u201d \nmay obtain review of a withdrawal order \u201cin accordance \nwith section 387l,\u201d the judicial-review provision at issue \nhere.  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2).  \nThe statutory text makes plain, and respondents \nagree (Br. in Opp. 11), that the Act does not allow a re-\ntailer to challenge an order withdrawing authorization.  \nBut a withdrawal order, which forces a retailer to stop \npreviously lawful sales, affects a retailer\u2019s interests far \nmore directly than a denial order.  See Pet. App. 7a \n(Higginson, J., dissenting).  Respondents have prof-\nfered no persuasive reason why Congress would have \nwanted to allow retailers to challenge the denial of au-\nthorization to market a new tobacco product at the out-\nset, but not to challenge the agency\u2019s withdrawal of a \nprevious authorization.   \n\n23 \n \nReinforcing that point, Congress required FDA to \nfollow more robust procedures when issuing withdrawal \norders than when issuing denial orders.  Before the \nagency issues a withdrawal order, it must provide the \napplicant with a hearing, see 21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(1), in \nwhich the applicant enjoys specified procedural rights, \nsee 21 U.S.C. 321(x).  It would have been strange for \nCongress to conclude that granting additional proce-\ndural rights to the applicant somehow compensated for \ndenying judicial review to entities other than the appli-\ncant.   \n3. Precedent confirms that retailers lack the right to \nseek judicial review  \nThe interpretive issue presented in this case closely \nresembles the interpretive issue resolved in Block v. \nCommunity Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984).  \nThe statute in Block empowered an agency to issue \nmarket orders setting minimum prices to be paid by \nmilk handlers to milk producers.  See id. at 341-342.  It \nauthorized handlers to seek judicial review of market \norders, but only after exhausting administrative reme-\ndies.  See id. at 346.  A handler tried to bypass that ex-\nhaustion requirement by joining a group of milk con-\nsumers to challenge a market order under the APA.  \nSee id. at 344-345.  \nThe D.C. Circuit held that the consumers could sue, \nbut then-Judge Scalia dissented from that aspect of its \ndecision.  See Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, \n698 F.2d 1239, 1256-1258 (1983) (Scalia, J., concurring \nin part and dissenting in part), rev\u2019d, 467 U.S. 340 \n(1984).  Judge Scalia emphasized that the market orders \nhad a \u201cdirect and immediate\u201d effect on handlers, but \nonly an \u201cindirect\u201d effect on consumers.  Id. at 1257.  He \nreasoned that, because the \u201cimmediately affected\u201d group \n\n24 \n \n(handlers) was \u201creadily identifiable\u201d and could be \u201cre-\nlied upon to challenge agency disregard of the law,\u201d the \n\u201cmore remote\u201d group (consumers) could not be \u201cfound \nto meet the zone of interests test.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThis Court agreed with Judge Scalia that consumers \nlacked the right to challenge milk market orders.  See \nBlock, 467 U.S. at 346-348.  The Court emphasized that, \nalthough the statute authorized handlers \u201cto participate \nin the adoption and retention of market orders,\u201d it con-\ntained no \u201cexpress provision for participation by con-\nsumers.\u201d  Id. at 346-347.  The Court inferred that, be-\ncause Congress had excluded consumers from the \u201creg-\nulatory process,\u201d it \u201cintended a similar restriction of ju-\ndicial review.\u201d  Id. at 347.  The Court added that allow-\ning consumer suits \u201cwould provide handlers with a con-\nvenient device for evading the statutory [exhaustion] \nrequirement\u201d; a handler \u201cwould need only to find a con-\nsumer who is willing to join in or initiate an action in the \ndistrict court.\u201d  Id. at 348.  Because that result would \n\u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the exhaustion requirement, the \nCourt found it \u201cclear that Congress intended that judi-\ncial review of market orders  * * *  ordinarily be con-\nfined to suits brought by handlers.\u201d  Ibid.   \nMost of this Court\u2019s and Judge Scalia\u2019s reasoning in \nBlock also applies here.  An FDA order denying an ap-\nplication for marketing authorization has a direct and \nimmediate effect on the applicant itself, but only an in-\ndirect and incidental effect on retail sellers of the appli-\ncant\u2019s products.  The Act authorizes the applicant itself \nto participate in the regulatory process, but it contains \nno provision for participation by retailers.  And allowing \nretailer suits could hand applicants a convenient device \nfor evading the Act\u2019s venue restrictions; unless this \nCourt rejects the court of appeals\u2019 rule that venue need \n\n25 \n \nbe proper only as to one party, a disappointed applicant \ncould simply find a retailer that is willing to join in a \npetition for review in a preferred circuit.  Those fea-\ntures of the statutory scheme all indicate that only ap-\nplicants, not retailers, may seek judicial review of or-\nders denying applications.  \nIn some respects, this case follows a fortiori from \nBlock.  Block involved a suit under the APA, see 467 \nU.S. at 345, while this case involves a petition for review \nunder the Tobacco Control Act.  The Court has applied \nthe zone-of-interests test more stringently in non-APA \ncases than in APA cases.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  \nBlock also involved judicial review of a rulemaking, see \n467 U.S. at 342, while this case involves judicial review \nof an adjudication.  It is particularly natural to infer that \nonly the parties to an adjudication may challenge its \noutcome in court.  See p. 14, supra.   \n4. The court of appeals\u2019 reasoning is flawed \nThe court of appeals reasoned that a retail seller may \nseek judicial review of a denial order because such an \norder \u201caffect[s]\u201d the seller by reducing its sales.  Pet. \nApp. 4a.  But as explained above, the phrase \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d is a term of art in administrative law.  See pp. \n11-12, supra.  The critical question is not whether a de-\nnial order harms the seller in some way; it is whether \nthat harm \u201cconstitutes adverse effect\u201d within the mean-\ning of the Act.  Newport News, 514 U.S. at 126 (empha-\nsis omitted).  For the reasons given above, the Act\u2019s \nstructure shows that it does not.   \nThe court of appeals also emphasized that the statute \nrefers to \u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d  Pet. App. 4a \n(quoting 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)).  But \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 can-\nnot expand the phrase\u201d that follows.  National Ass\u2019n of \nManufacturers v. Department of Defense, 583 U.S. 109, \n\n26 \n \n123 (2018).  Despite the inclusion of the word \u201cany,\u201d the \nterm \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d still requires a \nshowing that the person has been \u201cadversely affected,\u201d \nwhich in turn requires a showing that the person falls \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the statutory \nprovision at issue.  See, e.g., Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n126 (interpreting 33 U.S.C. 921(c), which referred to \n\u201cany person adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d) (brackets \nomitted).   \nThe court of appeals next contrasted the provision at \nissue here\u2014under which an \u201cadversely affected\u201d person \nmay challenge a denial order, 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)\u2014with \nthe provision under which the \u201cholder of an application\u201d \nmay challenge a withdrawal order, 21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2).  \nSee Pet. App. 4a-5a.  The court read too much into that \ncontrast.  The provision at issue authorizes judicial re-\nview not only of a \u201cdenial\u201d of an application, but also of \na \u201cregulation\u201d establishing, amending, or revoking a to-\nbacco product standard.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The term \n\u201cholder of an application,\u201d used in the narrower provi-\nsion specifically addressing judicial review of with-\ndrawal orders, would have been a poor fit for the full \nrange of agency actions covered by the provision here.  \nIf anything, the provision concerning judicial review of \nwithdrawal orders cuts against the court of appeals\u2019 \nreading.  It would have been incongruous for Congress \nto allow retailers to challenge denial orders, but not to \nchallenge withdrawal orders.  See pp. 22-23, supra.    \nFinally, the court of appeals stated that concerns \nabout petitions for review filed by retailers should be \n\u201cdirected to Congress,\u201d not to the courts.  Pet. App. 5a.  \nBut that suggestion rests on the mistaken premise that \nthe statute, as written, allows retailers to seek judicial \nreview.  The term \u201cadversely affected\u201d requires \u201cthe \n\n27 \n \ncourts\u201d to infer, \u201cin the context of  * * *  the particular \nstatutory pattern,\u201d \u201cwho is entitled to judicial review.\u201d  \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on \nthe Administrative Procedure Act 96 (1947); see New-\nport News, 514 U.S. at 126-127 (quoting the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Manual).  Courts must carry out the function \nthat Congress entrusted to them.  And as discussed \nabove, the statutory pattern here shows that retailers \nmay not challenge an FDA order denying a manufac-\nturer\u2019s application. \nB. A Manufacturer May File A Petition For Review Only \nIn The D.C. Circuit Or The Circuit Where It Is Based  \nThe Fifth Circuit further erred by holding that a \ngroup of petitioners may file a petition for review in a \ncircuit so long as \u201ca petitioner\u201d resides or maintains its \nprincipal place of business within that circuit.  R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 188 (5th Cir. \n2023) (emphasis added); see Pet. App. 5a.  Unless Con-\ngress provides otherwise, courts must evaluate venue \nparty by party, and venue must be proper as to each \nparty.  A petitioner for whom venue is improper may not \nsimply tag along with one for whom it is proper.  See \nAmerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commis-\nsion, 338 F.2d 808, 809-810 (10th Cir. 1964) (interpret-\ning a similarly worded venue statute to mean that an out-\nof-circuit petitioner could not join a local petitioner); Na-\ntional Family Farm Coalition v. EPA, 966 F.3d 893, \n930-932 (9th Cir. 2020) (Nelson, J., concurring) (same).  \n1. The Act does not authorize one person to lay venue \nbased on a different person\u2019s residence or principal \nplace of business \nIn general, a party may bring a suit only if a statute \nauthorizes it to do so.  See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \n\n28 \n \nU.S. 275, 286-287 (2001).  That authorization ordinarily \nmust be explicit; Congress usually does not create new \nremedies by implication.  See Cummings v. Premier \nRehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 226 (2022).  The \ngovernment thus does not bear the burden of showing \nthat the Tobacco Control Act prohibits Reynolds from \nseeking judicial review in the Fifth Circuit.  Instead, re-\nspondents bear the burden of proving that the Act af-\nfirmatively authorizes Reynolds to do so.  They cannot \nmake that showing. \nThe Act states that \u201cany person adversely affected \nby [a] regulation or denial may file a petition for judicial \nreview of such regulation or denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added).  The word \u201csuch,\u201d when used to modify a \nnoun, refers back to something \u201cpreviously spoken of.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, 477 (1827).  \nThe term \u201csuch person\u201d thus makes clear that a person \nmay seek judicial review in a circuit (other than the D.C. \nCircuit) only if that person is based in that circuit.  \nParty A may not sue in a circuit just because party B \nlives there.  The court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatute to allow a person to sue in \u201cthe circuit in which \nsuch person [or a retail seller of such person\u2019s products] \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d  21 \nU.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \nThe Act also uses singular rather than plural nouns, \nauthorizing a \u201cperson\u201d to file \u201ca petition\u201d in the circuit \nwhere the \u201cperson\u201d resides or has its principal place of \nbusiness.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That matters because \nthe use of the singular or the plural can illuminate a \nstatute\u2019s meaning.  See Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. 155, 161-164 (2021); Life Technologies Corp. v. \nPromega Corp., 580 U.S. 140, 149-151 (2017).  Here, the \n\u201cuse of the singular noun \u2018person\u2019  * * *  suggests venue \nshould be analyzed on a petitioner-by-petitioner basis.\u201d  \nNational Family Farm Coalition, 966 F.3d at 930 (Nel-\nson, J., concurring). \nFinally, the Act lists three venues in which a person \nmay seek judicial review: the D.C. Circuit, the circuit \nwhere the person resides, and the circuit in which the \nperson has its principal place of business.  See 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1).  The Act\u2019s enumeration of those three options \nimplies the exclusion of others, such as the circuit where \na co-petitioner resides.  Expressio unius est exclusio al-\nterius.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 300 \n(2018); Scalia & Garner 107. \n2. Traditional principles of joinder confirm that an out-\nof-circuit manufacturer does not acquire a right to \nsue in a circuit by joining a local retailer \nAlthough the Act does not address the filing of joint \npetitions, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure \nprovide that \u201ctwo or more persons may join in a petition \nto the same court to review the same order\u201d if \u201ctheir \ninterests make joinder practicable.\u201d  Fed. R. App. P. \n15(a)(1).  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure similarly \nallow multiple plaintiffs to join in one complaint.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).  Joinder, however, just allows \nsuits that could have been brought separately to be \nbrought together; it does not allow an out-of-circuit \nmanufacturer to piggyback on a local retailer\u2019s claims.   \nJoinder is a device for the \u201caggregation of claims.\u201d  \nSprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., \n554 U.S. 269, 291 (2008).  Although it \u201cenables a federal \ncourt to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, \ninstead of in separate suits,\u201d it \u201cleaves the parties\u2019 legal \n\n30 \n \nrights and duties intact and the rules of decision un-\nchanged.\u201d  Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. All-\nstate Insurance Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality \nopinion).  Said otherwise, joinder rules \u201care procedural \nmeans of processing claims, not fonts of judicial author-\nity.\u201d  Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, 362 \n(2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part).  \nThus, if multiple plaintiffs join in one complaint, \n\u201ceach plaintiff\u200a\u2019s right of action remains distinct, as if it \nhad been brought separately.\u201d  7 Charles Alan Wright \net al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1652, at 414 \n(4th ed. 2019) (Wright & Miller).  Joinder cannot \u201cres-\ncue claims that would have been doomed  * * *  if they \nhad been asserted in a separate action\u201d; conversely, it \ndoes not require \u201cdismissal of claims that would have \notherwise survived.\u201d  Rockwell International Corp. v. \nUnited States, 549 U.S. 457, 476 (2007) (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Merena v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., \n205 F.3d 97, 103 (3d Cir. 2000) (Alito, J.)).   \nThe Tobacco Control Act plainly would not allow \nReynolds to file its own petition for review in the Fifth \nCircuit.  Under ordinary principles of joinder, it follows \nthat Reynolds is equally unable to join someone else\u2019s \npetition in that circuit.  \n3. Traditional principles of venue confirm that venue \nmust be proper as to each petitioner  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the Act conflicts \nnot only with statutory text and traditional principles of \njoinder, but also with traditional principles of venue.  \n\u201cFaced with multi-party cases,\u201d this Court \u201clong ago \nheld that venue must be proper as to each party.\u201d  14D \nWright & Miller \u00a7 3807, at 204 (4th ed. 2013).  Today, \u201cit \nis common for courts to say that venue must be proper \n\n31 \n \nas to each claim and as to each party.\u201d  Id. at 206-207.  \nTreatise writers agree that, \u201cwhen a special venue stat-\nute allows venue where the plaintiff resides,\u201d \u201cvenue \nwould not be proper for [multiple] plaintiffs in a district \nin which only one of them resides.\u201d  Id. at 206. \nThis Court first applied that party-specific approach \nin interpreting a 19th-century statute authorizing a \nplaintiff to bring a diversity suit \u201cin the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defend[a]nt.\u201d  Act \nof Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 373, \u00a7 1, 24 Stat. 552-553.  In Smith \nv. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890), the Court held that the \nstatute\u2019s reference to \u201cthe plaintiff\u200a\u201d meant every plain-\ntiff, not just one plaintiff.  See id. at 317-320.  And in \nCamp v. Gress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919), the Court held that \nthe term \u201cthe defendant\u201d in a similarly worded succes-\nsor statute meant every defendant, not just one defend-\nant.  See id. at 311-316.  Those decisions establish that, \nin a multi-party case, \u201ceach plaintiff must be competent \nto sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant must be liable to be sued\u201d \nin the chosen forum.  Smith, 133 U.S. at 319 (citation \nomitted); see Camp, 250 U.S. at 312 (requiring \u201ceach\u201d \nparty to be \u201ccompetent to sue, or liable to be sued,\u201d in \nthe chosen court) (citation omitted).  \nThis Court adhered to that approach in Bankers Life \n& Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379 (1953).  The \nvenue statute there allowed an antitrust plaintiff to sue \n\u201cin the district in which the defendant resides or is \nfound or has an agent.\u201d  15 U.S.C. 15(a).  Even though \nantitrust cases routinely involve conspiracies among \nmultiple defendants, the Court analyzed venue one de-\nfendant at a time.  See Holland, 346 U.S. at 384.  It ex-\nplained that, when venue does not \u201clie in one district as \nto all defendants,\u201d proceedings would need to be \u201csev-\nered and transferred or filed in separate districts origi-\n\n32 \n \nnally.\u201d  Ibid.  The plaintiff had argued that each anti-\ntrust defendant could be regarded as an \u201cagent\u201d of his \nco-conspirators, enabling all of them to be sued where \nany one of them lived.  See id. at 380-381.  But the Court \nrejected that theory, stating that it had \u201call the ear-\nmarks of a frivolous albeit ingenious attempt to expand \nthe statute,\u201d which had \u201cplaced definite limits on \nvenue.\u201d  Id. at 384.  The Court thus explained that \n\u201cmany such cases would not lie in one district as to all \ndefendants, unless venue was waived\u201d as a defense.  \nIbid. \nIn fact, other precedents of this Court require courts \nto evaluate venue not just party by party, but claim by \nclaim.  See Geneva Furniture Manufacturing Co. v.  \nS. Karpen & Bros., 238 U.S. 254, 258-259 (1915).  In \nother words, \u201cif the plaintiff asserts multiple claims \nagainst the defendant, venue must be proper for each \nclaim.\u201d  14D Wright & Miller \u00a7 3808, at 213.  That rule \nconfirms the broader principle that venue \u201ccannot be \nenlarged or extended by uniting [different causes of ac-\ntion] in a single suit.\u201d  Geneva, 238 U.S. at 259.  \nThis Court\u2019s party-by-party approach to venue is \nconsistent with its party-by-party approach to other \nthreshold statutory requirements.  For example, the \nCourt has long interpreted the diversity-jurisdiction \nstatute to require complete diversity; each plaintiff \nmust be diverse from each defendant.  See Strawbridge \nv. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267, 267-268 (1806).  The Court has \nread amount-in-controversy requirements, in the diver-\nsity statute as well as in other jurisdictional grants, to \nmean that \u201ceach of several plaintiffs is bound to estab-\nlish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own \nclaim.\u201d  Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 590 \n(1939); see Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U.S. \n\n33 \n \n291, 294-295 & n.3 (1973) (collecting cases).  And the \nCourt has interpreted the removal statute to mean that, \nwhen \u201cthere is more than one defendant, all the defend-\nants must join\u201d in removing the case from state to fed-\neral court.  Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur, & Evansville \nRy. Co., 179 U.S. 335, 337 (1900); see Chicago, Rock Is-\nland, & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Martin, 178 U.S. 245, 248 \n(1900).   \nThe party-by-party approach to venue vindicates the \ngeneral purpose of such provisions.  The plaintiff, as \nmaster of its complaint, controls which co-plaintiffs and \nco-defendants it will name.  But \u201cthe purpose of statu-\ntorily specified venue is to protect the defendant.\u201d  \nLeroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 183-\n184 (1979).  Venue restrictions would not serve that pur-\npose if a plaintiff could evade them simply by adding \nmore parties to its complaint.  \nThe principle that venue must be proper as to each \nparty is, of course, simply a default rule.  Congress is \nfree to adopt a different approach in a particular stat-\nute.  Congress has thus enacted special venue statutes \nthat authorize suit where \u201cany party resides,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n44309(d)(1); where \u201cany plaintiff resides,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n2334(a); where \u201cany defendant resides,\u201d 43 U.S.C. \n1349(b)(1); where \u201ca defendant in the action resides,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(A); or where \u201cany one defendant can \nbe found,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3732(a).  It has also provided that, \nin certain cases, a \u201cjoinder of  * * *  a defendant shall be \ndisregarded in determining where the action may be \nbrought with respect to the other defendants.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1391(c)(3).   \nThe statute at issue here, however, does not allow an \nadversely affected person to seek judicial review in a \ncircuit where \u201cany petitioner\u201d resides.  Nor does it state \n\n34 \n \nthat a joinder may be disregarded in analyzing venue.  \nTo the contrary, by authorizing an adversely affected \nperson to sue in the circuit where \u201csuch person resides \nor has their principal place of business,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1), the Act makes clear that a person may seek \nreview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) only if \nthat person is based in the circuit.  See pp. 28-29, supra.   \nC. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Interpretation Effectively Nullifies \nThe Act\u2019s Restrictions On Venue \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors\u2014allowing retailers to sue \nand requiring venue to be proper as to only one party\u2014\ncombine to produce a result that defies elementary \nprinciples of statutory interpretation.  A court should \nread a statute \u201cso that effect is given to all provisions, \nso that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void \nor insignificant.\u201d  Ysleta del sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 \nU.S. 685, 698-699 (2022) (citation omitted).  Courts \nshould avoid readings that would facilitate a statute\u2019s \n\u201cevasion\u201d or would enable parties \u201cto elude its provi-\nsions in the most easy manner.\u201d  The Emily, 9 Wheat. \n381, 389-390 (1824); see Scalia & Garner 63.   \nThose principles apply to venue statutes no less than \nto other statutes.  This Court has resisted reading \nvenue statutes in a way that would, in practice, \u201cgive the \nplaintiff an unrestrained choice of venues.\u201d  Leroy, 443 \nU.S. at 186-187 & n.23.  The Court has likewise avoided \ninterpretations that would \u201cencourage gamesmanship\u201d \nor \u201c\u200a\u2018create or multiply opportunities for forum shop-\nping.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. United \nStates District Court, 571 U.S. 49, 65 (2013) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, \n447 (2004) (rejecting interpretation that would allow \n\u201crampant forum shopping\u201d). \n\n35 \n \nContrary to those fundamental principles, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach drains the Act\u2019s venue restrictions of \nmeaning, facilitates their ready circumvention, and in-\nvites unchecked forum shopping.  Even though the Act \nspecifies only three venues where a person may seek ju-\ndicial review, see 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1), the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading allows an applicant to seek review in any \nregional circuit through the simple expedient of enlist-\ning a local retailer that is interested in selling (or a local \nconsumer who is interested in using) its products.  This \nCourt should not lightly conclude that Congress en-\nacted such a \u201cself-defeating statute.\u201d  Pugin v. Gar-\nland, 599 U.S. 600, 607 (2023) (citation omitted); see Cit-\nizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 20 \n(1995) (\u201cIt is an elementary rule of construction that \n\u2018the act cannot be held to destroy itself.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation undermines the \nAct\u2019s venue framework in additional ways.  By author-\nizing each adversely affected person to seek judicial re-\nview in that person\u2019s home circuit, the Act spreads out \nthe work of reviewing denial orders across all the re-\ngional circuits.  That is no small matter given the vol-\nume of work involved; FDA has received more than 27 \nmillion applications for marketing authorization since \n2024.  See Testimony of Brian A. King, Dir., Center for \nTobacco Products, FDA, Evaluating FDA Human \nFoods and Tobacco Programs (Sept. 10, 2024).  Under \nthe decision below, however, applicants throughout the \ncountry\u2014indeed, throughout the world\u2014could all head \nto a single circuit for judicial review.  That concern is \nnot hypothetical; as discussed above, applicants from \nChina, California, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, \nOhio, and Washington have all flocked to the Fifth Cir-\n\n36 \n \ncuit.  See pp. 10-11, supra.  That result thwarts Con-\ngress\u2019s effort to allocate cases among the circuits in an \norderly and sensible way.  Cf. Pet. Br. at 15, TC Heart-\nland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. \n258 (2017) (No. 16-341) (noting that plaintiffs had ex-\nploited an expansive reading of the patent venue statute \n\u2014which this Court ultimately reversed\u2014to file roughly \n40% of the Nation\u2019s patent cases in a single district).  \nThe Act, moreover, designates the D.C. Circuit as \nthe sole circuit where a person may seek judicial review \nregardless of residence or principal place of business.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That provision reflects the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201cunique character\u201d as a \u201cnational court\u201d \nwith \u201cspecial responsibility to review legal challenges to \nthe conduct of the national government,\u201d irrespective of \nwhere the challenger lives.  John G. Roberts, Jr., What \nMakes the D.C. Circuit Different? A Historical View, \n92 Va. L. Rev. 375, 389 (2006).  Yet the decision below \nwould transform every regional court of appeals into  \nanother national court.  It would allow every circuit to \nhear cases brought there by manufacturers from \naround the country (and the world), defeating Con-\ngress\u2019s decision to vest such nationwide responsibility \nin the D.C. Circuit alone. \nIf Congress had meant to allow an applicant to seek \njudicial review in any circuit, it would have said so.  \nSome federal statutes authorize suit in \u201cany United \nStates district court,\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1640(e), or \u201cany United \nStates Court of Appeals,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 7482(b)(2).  The To-\nbacco Control Act, however, contains no such provision.  \nThe Fifth Circuit nonetheless held that an applicant \nmay file a petition for review anywhere in the country, \nso long as it can find a local retailer willing to join its \npetition.  But the court \u201coffered no reason for Congress \n\n37 \n \nto have constructed such an obscure path to such a sim-\nple result.\u201d  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 52 (2012). \nThe potential consequences of the court of appeals\u2019 \napproach extend beyond the Tobacco Control Act.  Many \nfederal statutes authorize an adversely affected or ag-\ngrieved person to challenge an agency order in the D.C. \nCircuit or the circuit where the person is based.3  But \nthe logic of the decision below would make it easy for \nchallengers to avoid those restrictions:  A challenger \nneed only (1) find someone who lives in the preferred \ncircuit and is indirectly affected by the order and \n(2) seek review alongside that person.   \nThe forum shopping invited by the decision below \nnot only violates the Act, but also harms the Judiciary.  \nWhen parties throughout the country deploy complex \nprocedural stratagems to channel their cases to a single \ncircuit, even when they have no meaningful ties to that \ncircuit, they erode the perception that judicial decisions \nrest on universally applicable rules of law.  This Court \nshould avoid that harm by correcting the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 erroneous interpretation of the Act\u2019s venue provi-\nsion.   \n \n3 See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 7123(a); 15 U.S.C. 77i(a), 80a\u201342(a), 80b\u201313(a), \n1710(a); 20 U.S.C. 6083(f\u200a)(5), 7973(e)(5); 21 U.S.C. 346a(h)(1), \n348(g)(1), 360g(a), 457(d), 607(e), 1036(b); 22 U.S.C. 6761(a)(5);  \n29 U.S.C. 160(f\u200a), 210(a), 660(a); 49 U.S.C. 5127(a), 47106(d)(3), \n47111(d)(3). \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C. Circuit.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS \nGeneral Counsel \nDepartment of Health and \nHuman Services \nMARK RAZA \nChief Counsel \nWENDY S.

or \n \n(ii) \nhas different characteristics and the \ninformation submitted contains information, \nincluding clinical data if deemed necessary by \nthe Secretary, that demonstrates that it is not \nappropriate to regulate the product under this \nsection because the product does not raise dif-\nferent questions of public health. \n \n(B) \nCharacteristics \n \nIn subparagraph (A), the term \u201ccharacteris-\ntics\u201d means the materials, ingredients, design, \ncomposition, heating source, or other features of a \ntobacco product. \n \n(C) \nLimitation \n \nA tobacco product may not be found to be sub-\nstantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco prod-\nuct that has been removed from the market at the \ninitiative of the Secretary or that has been deter-\nmined by a judicial order to be misbranded or \nadulterated. \n(4) Health information \n \n(A) \nSummary \n \nAs part of a submission under section 387e(\u200aj) of \nthis title respecting a tobacco product, the person \nrequired to file a premarket notification under \nsuch section shall provide an adequate summary \nof any health information related to the tobacco \n\n4a \n \nproduct or state that such information will be \nmade available upon request by any person. \n \n(B) \nRequired information \n \nAny summary under subparagraph (A) re-\nspecting a tobacco product shall contain detailed \ninformation regarding data concerning adverse \nhealth effects and shall be made available to the \npublic by the Secretary within 30 days of the issu-\nance of a determination that such tobacco product \nis substantially equivalent to another tobacco \nproduct. \n(b) \nApplication \n(1) Contents \n \nAn application under this section shall contain\u2014 \n \n(A) \nfull reports of all information, published \nor known to, or which should reasonably be known \nto, the applicant, concerning investigations which \nhave been made to show the health risks of such \ntobacco product and whether such tobacco prod-\nuct presents less risk than other tobacco products;

\n \n(B) \nthat the application contained or was ac-\ncompanied by an untrue statement of a material \nfact; \n \n(C) \nthat the applicant\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas failed to establish a system for \nmaintaining records, or has repeatedly or de-\nliberately failed to maintain records or to make \nreports, required by an applicable regulation \nunder section 387i of this title; \n \n(ii) \nhas refused to permit access to, or \ncopying or verification of, such records as re-\nquired by section 374 of this title; or \n \n(iii) \nhas not complied with the require-\nments of section 387e of this title; \n \n(D) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary with respect to such tobacco prod-\nuct, evaluated together with the evidence before \nthe Secretary when the application was reviewed, \n\n10a \n \nthat the methods used in, or the facilities and con-\ntrols used for, the manufacture, processing, pack-\ning, or installation of such tobacco product do not \nconform with the requirements of section 387f(e) \nof this title and were not brought into conformity \nwith such requirements within a reasonable time \nafter receipt of written notice from the Secretary \nof nonconformity; \n \n(E) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary, evaluated together with the evi-\ndence before the Secretary when the application \nwas reviewed, that the labeling of such tobacco \nproduct, based on a fair evaluation of all material \nfacts, is false or misleading in any particular and \nwas not corrected within a reasonable time after \nreceipt of written notice from the Secretary of \nsuch fact; or \n \n(F) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary, evaluated together with the evi-\ndence before the Secretary when such order was \nissued, that such tobacco product is not shown to \nconform in all respects to a tobacco product stand-\nard which is in effect under section 387g of this ti-\ntle, compliance with which was a condition to the \nissuance of an order relating to the application, \nand that there is a lack of adequate information to \njustify the deviation from such standard. \n(2) Appeal \n \nThe holder of an application subject to an order \nissued under paragraph (1) withdrawing an order is-\nsued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) may, by peti-\ntion filed on or before the 30th day after the date \n\n11a \n \nupon which such holder receives notice of such with-\ndrawal, obtain review thereof in accordance with sec-\ntion 387l of this title. \n(3) Temporary suspension \n \nIf, after providing an opportunity for an informal \nhearing, the Secretary determines there is reasona-\nble probability that the continuation of distribution of \na tobacco product under an order would cause seri-\nous, adverse health consequences or death, that is \ngreater than ordinarily caused by tobacco products \non the market, the Secretary shall by order tempo-\nrarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to \nmarket the product.  If the Secretary issues such an \norder, the Secretary shall proceed expeditiously un-\nder paragraph (1) to withdraw such application. \n(e) \nService of order \nAn order issued by the Secretary under this section \nshall be served\u2014 \n \n(1) in person by any officer or employee of the \ndepartment designated by the Secretary; or \n \n(2) by mailing the order by registered mail or \ncertified mail addressed to the applicant at the appli-\ncant\u2019s last known address in the records of the Sec-\nretary. \n(f\u200a) \nRecords \n(1) Additional information \n \nIn the case of any tobacco product for which an \norder issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for an \napplication filed under subsection (b) is in effect, the \napplicant shall establish and maintain such records, \n\n12a \n \nand make such reports to the Secretary, as the Sec-\nretary may by regulation, or by order with respect to \nsuch application, prescribe on the basis of a finding \nthat such records and reports are necessary in order \nto enable the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a \ndetermination of, whether there is or may be grounds \nfor withdrawing or temporarily suspending such or-\nder. \n(2) Access to records \n \nEach person required under this section to main-\ntain records, and each person in charge of custody \nthereof, shall, upon request of an officer or employee \ndesignated by the Secretary, permit such officer or \nemployee at all reasonable times to have access to \nand copy and verify such records. \n(g) \nInvestigational tobacco product exemption for in-\nvestigational use \nThe Secretary may exempt tobacco products in-\ntended for investigational use from the provisions of this \nsubchapter under such conditions as the Secretary may \nby regulation prescribe. \n \n \n \n\n13a \n \n2. \n21 U.S.C. 387l provides: \nJudicial review \n(a) \nRight to review \n(1) In general \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe promulgation of a regulation under \nsection 387g of this title establishing, amending, \nor revoking a tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B) \na denial of an application under section \n387j(c) of this title, \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business. \n(2) Requirements \n \n(A) \nCopy of petition \n \nA copy of the petition filed under paragraph (1) \nshall be transmitted by the clerk of the court in-\nvolved to the Secretary. \n \n(B) \nRecord of proceedings \n \nOn receipt of a petition under subparagraph \n(A), the Secretary shall file in the court in which \nsuch petition was filed\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthe record of the proceedings on which \nthe regulation or order was based; and \n\n14a \n \n \n(ii) \na statement of the reasons for the is-\nsuance of such a regulation or order. \n \n(C) \nDefinition of record \n \n \nIn this section, the term \u201crecord\u201d means\u2014 \n \n(i) \nall notices and other matter published \nin the Federal Register with respect to the reg-\nulation or order reviewed; \n \n(ii) \nall information submitted to the Sec-\nretary with respect to such regulation or order; \n \n(iii) \nproceedings of any panel or advisory \ncommittee with respect to such regulation or \norder; \n \n(iv) \nany hearing held with respect to such \nregulation or order; and \n \n(v) \nany other information identified by \nthe Secretary, in the administrative proceeding \nheld with respect to such regulation or order, \nas being relevant to such regulation or order. \n(b) \nStandard of review \nUpon the filing of the petition under subsection (a) \nfor judicial review of a regulation or order, the court \nshall have jurisdiction to review the regulation or order \nin accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to grant ap-\npropriate relief, including interim relief, as provided for \nin such chapter.

Reynolds & Retailers):** Argue for a broader interpretation, asserting that the economic harm (inability to sell a product) they suffer as a direct consequence of the denial order makes them \"adversely affected.\"\n*   **Procedural Posture:** The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit adopted the broader interpretation, siding with the retailers and finding they had standing. The Supreme Court is reviewing this specific holding.\n*   **Key Information Needed:** While I now understand the question, I still lack knowledge of the specific textual arguments, legislative history, and legal precedents each side will use to support their interpretation of \"adversely affected.\" My prediction will depend on analyzing the briefs to see which precedents (e.g., from administrative law on standing, or other cases interpreting similar statutory language) the Court is likely to find more persuasive.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case began with the core legal question: whether retailers are \"adversely affected\" by an FDA marketing denial issued to a manufacturer, thus giving them standing to seek judicial review under the Tobacco Control Act. I knew the FDA would argue for a narrow interpretation (only the manufacturer has standing) while the retailers would argue for a broader one based on economic harm, and that the Fifth Circuit had sided with the retailers.\n\nThe observation of the Petitioner's (FDA's) brief has dramatically sharpened this understanding, moving from a general framework to a detailed map of the government's legal strategy. My beliefs are now updated with the specific arguments, precedents, and statutory interpretations the FDA will present to the Supreme Court.\n\n*   **Refined Legal Questions & Strategy:** The government strategically frames the issue not just as one of standing, but as one of venue and forum shopping. The question presented in their brief is: \"Whether a manufacturer may file a petition for review in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it neither resides nor has its principal place of business, if the petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s products that is located within that circuit.\" This framing immediately highlights the procedural maneuvering at the heart of the case.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Core Arguments (Standing & Venue):** The FDA's argument is a two-pronged attack on the Fifth Circuit's decision.\n    1.  **Retailers Lack a Right to Review (\"Zone of Interests\"):** The primary argument is that retailers are not \"adversely affected\" in a legally cognizable way because their interests fall outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the Tobacco Control Act's premarket review provisions (21 U.S.C. 387j). The government contends this statutory section is concerned with the public health evaluation of a manufacturer's application, not the downstream economic interests of retailers. The structure of the Act, which centers the application, confidentiality, and denial process exclusively on the manufacturer, is presented as evidence that Congress intended to limit review to the applicant.\n    2.  **Improper Venue & Joinder:** The secondary, but equally important, argument is that even if a retailer had standing, their local residence cannot be used to establish venue for an out-of-circuit manufacturer. The government argues that the judicial review provision (21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)) requires venue to be proper for each petitioner individually. They assert that traditional principles of joinder and venue do not allow one party to \"piggyback\" on another's venue status.\n\n*   **Key Precedents Cited by Petitioner (FDA):** The brief grounds these arguments in significant administrative and procedural law precedent.\n    *   On the \"zone of interests\" and who is \"adversely affected,\" the government heavily relies on:\n        *   ***Block v. Community Nutrition Institute* (1984):** This is a cornerstone of their argument, likely used to argue that the statutory scheme implicitly precludes judicial review for parties other than the direct subject of the agency action (the manufacturer).\n        *   ***Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.* (2014):** Used to define the modern \"zone of interests\" test.\n        *   ***Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.* (1995):** Another key case on what it means to be \"adversely affected\" by an agency order.\n    *   On venue and joinder, they cite:\n        *   ***Smith v. Lyon* (1890):** A foundational case establishing that venue must be proper for all joined parties.\n        *   ***TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC* (2017):** A recent case emphasizing a strict, textualist approach to venue statutes, which the government will likely urge the Court to apply here.\n\n*   **Consequences Argument:** The FDA concludes with a powerful policy argument: allowing the Fifth Circuit's decision to stand would \"effectively nullify\" the Act's specific venue limitations. It would permit any manufacturer to forum-shop for the most favorable circuit by simply finding a single local retailer to join its petition, undermining Congress's intent to limit review to the D.C. Circuit or the manufacturer's home circuit.\n\n*   **Key Information Needed:** I now have a detailed understanding of the government's case. My predictive model now requires the counterarguments. I need to see the Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds and the retailers) brief to understand how they will:\n    1.  Argue that a retailer's economic harm places them squarely within the \"zone of interests\" of the Tobacco Control Act.\n    2.  Distinguish or reinterpret the precedents cited by the FDA, particularly *Block*.\n    3.  Present their own theory of venue and joinder, explaining why a retailer's proper venue should extend to the entire petition.\n    4.  Counter the FDA's \"forum shopping\" narrative.",

Acquiring this document is not an incremental update; it is essential for constructing a complete model of the legal conflict. It will reveal how R.J. Reynolds and the retailers will argue that they are 'adversely affected' under the statute, how they will distinguish the key precedents cited by the FDA (like *Block*), and how they will counter the powerful 'forum shopping' narrative. This will cause a maximal shift in my posterior beliefs about the case outcome, making the Task EIG 1.0.

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.  Where multiple petitioners join a single petition \nfor review of an FDA denial of a marketing \napplication for a tobacco product, whether all \npetitioners may participate in the case if one \npetitioner has established venue. \n\nii \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nR.J.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 28,977 (May 10, 2016); see \nalso id. at 29,001 (\u201cas a practical effect of the Agency\u2019s \ncompliance \npolicy \u2026 FDA \nexpects \nthat \nmany \nmanufacturers \u2026 will continue to market their products\u201d); \nFDA, Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery \nSystems and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without \nPremarket Authorization 27 (Apr. 2020). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStores Association (\u201cMississippi Association\u201d), are \nretailers that sell menthol-flavored Vuse Alto. Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.  Where multiple petitioners join a single petition \nfor review of an FDA denial of a marketing \napplication for a tobacco product, whether all \npetitioners may participate in the case if one \npetitioner has established venue. \n\nii \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nR.J.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 28,977 (May 10, 2016); see \nalso id. at 29,001 (\u201cas a practical effect of the Agency\u2019s \ncompliance \npolicy \u2026 FDA \nexpects \nthat \nmany \nmanufacturers \u2026 will continue to market their products\u201d); \nFDA, Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery \nSystems and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without \nPremarket Authorization 27 (Apr. 2020). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStores Association (\u201cMississippi Association\u201d), are \nretailers that sell menthol-flavored Vuse Alto. Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d and \u201ca detrimental influence \non\u201d the retailer Respondents\u2019 interests, since they \ncannot sell the product at issue and if they do, will be \nsubject to severe penalties, see infra p. 12. Therefore, \nunder the plain text, retailer Respondents are \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s order. \nb. FDA tries to escape the statute\u2019s plain text by \nemphasizing that \u201c\u2018adversely affected\u2019 is a term of art \nin administrative law,\u201d Pet. 11, but the Agency fares \nno better under this Court\u2019s statutory standing \njurisprudence. The zone-of-interests test that this \nCourt has applied to determine when a party is \nsufficiently aggrieved to challenge agency action \u201cis \nnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). A party has \nstatutory standing if it asserts an interest that is \n\u201carguably\u201d protected or regulated by the statute. \nE.g., id. at 225\u201326. The zone-of-interests test \n\u201cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.\u201d Id. All that is required is \u201csome \nindicia\u2014however slight\u2014that the litigant before the \ncourt \nwas \n[(i)] intended \nto \nbe \nprotected \u2026 or \n[(ii)] regulated by the statute\u201d\u2014either suffices. \nCalumet Indus., Inc. v. Brock, 807 F.2d 225, 228 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986). This is assessed using \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory interpretation.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. \nv. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 197 (2017). And \u201cthe \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u201d Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225. \u201c[F]inancial \ninjury \u2026 satisf[ies] \nthe \n\u2018cause-of-action\u2019 \n(or \n\u2018prudential standing\u2019) requirement.\u201d Bank of Am., \n581 U.S. at 197. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Bank of America\u2014which \ninvolved a statute with virtually identical language \nabout who can sue\u2014controls this case. There, the \nCity of Miami sued several banks under the Fair \nHousing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), alleging that the banks \nengaged in discriminatory lending in the residential \nhousing market that caused the City economic harm. \nIn concluding that the City came within the FHA\u2019s \nzone of interests, the Supreme Court stressed the \ntextual \nbreadth \nof \nthe \nFHA\u2019s \njudicial-review \nprovision: \u201cThe FHA permits any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 \nto bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.\u201d Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)). Because the City \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclaimed that the banks\u2019 lending practices caused the \nCity\u2019s lost tax revenue, the Court concluded the City \nwas at least \u201carguably \u2026 within the FHA\u2019s zone of \ninterests\u201d\u2014even though the City did not suffer \ndiscrimination. Id. at 200\u201301.7 \nGiven this precedent, it is no wonder the Fifth \nCircuit rejected FDA\u2019s argument under the TCA. The \nstatutory language here\u2014\u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d\u2014is, if anything, broader than the FHA\u2019s \n\u201caggrieved person\u201d language. And the connection \nbetween the retailers\u2019 injuries and the interests \nprotected by the TCA is far more direct than the \nconnection between the City\u2019s lost tax revenue in \nBank of America and the FHA. This case thus follows \na fortiori from Bank of America. See also Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 144 S. Ct. 1414, 1423 \n(2024) (holding \u201can insurer such as Truck with \nfinancial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a \n\u2018party in interest\u2019 because it may be directly and \nadversely affected by the reorganization plan\u201d).8  \n \n7 Notably, the government filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of the position this Court adopted. See Brief for U.S. as \nAmicus Curiae Supporting Respondent, Bank of America, 581 \nU.S. 189, 2016 WL 5903233. \n8 The retailers\u2019 interests would establish standing even \nunder Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion in Bank of America. \nJustice Thomas concluded that the City\u2019s asserted injuries (lost \nrevenues and increased costs) did not implicate the interests \nprotected by the FHA. 581 U.S. at 207\u201309. (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part, dissenting in part). Here, there is no \nquestion that the retailers\u2019 injuries (inability to sell a tobacco \nproduct) directly implicate the interests protected by the TCA. \nSee infra p. 12. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nc. \nThis \nstraightforward \ninterpretation \nof \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), moreover, is confirmed by the structure \nof the TCA and statutory context. FDA seems to \nassert that, in allowing \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d to sue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded), Congress actually meant that \u201conly a \nmanufacturer of a product subject to a marketing \ndenial order\u201d or \u201conly an applicant whose premarket \napplication is denied\u201d could sue. But Congress knows \nhow to limit judicial-review provisions in that way, \nand, indeed, did so elsewhere in the TCA itself. \nCompare id. (\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may \nchallenge marketing denial orders for tobacco \nproducts), with id. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) (\u201c[t]he holder of an \napplication\u201d may challenge the withdrawal of \nmarketing authorization for tobacco products). For \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), in contrast, it uses the capacious phrase \n\u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d And \u201c[w]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order 4\u20135 \n(Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 \nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)); see also id. at 5 (\u201cCongress did \nnot limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those \nchallenging a withdrawal order. If the FDA disagrees \nwith Congress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the \n[TCA], its concerns are better directed to Congress \nthan to this court.\u201d). \nCongress also included rulemaking in the TCA\u2019s \njudicial-review provision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (\u201cany \nperson adversely affected by such regulation\u201d \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(emphasis added)). Under FDA\u2019s interpretation, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d would thus mean two \ndifferent \nthings \nin \nthe \nsame \nprovision: \nfor \nrulemaking, \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d means \n\u201cany person adversely affected,\u201d but for a denial \norder, \u201cany person adversely affect\u201d means \u201conly the \nadversely affected manufacturer.\u201d Basic interpretive \nrules reject such a reading. In a given statute, there \nis a presumption of consistent usage: the same term \nusually has the same meaning across different \napplications. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (\u201cTo give these same words [in a statutory \nphrase] a different meaning for each category would \nbe to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d). \nThe evidence that Congress meant what it said \ndoes not stop with the TCA. The U.S. Code is replete \nwith provisions that, unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1) here, \nexpressly limit the class of potential petitioners to \nparties who either played some specific role in the \nadministrative proceedings or satisfy other specified \ncriteria. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1047 (\u201cthe affected \napplicant\u201d) (emphasis added); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4634 (\u201cAny \nparty to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added); 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3247 (\u201cany party to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis \nadded); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (\u201cAny recipient which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 6869 (\u201cIf any \napplicant is dissatisfied\u201d) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 228b-3 (\u201cthe live poultry dealer\u201d) (emphasis added); \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189 (\u201cthe designated organization\u201d) \n(emphasis added); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (\u201cA person who is \nthe primary next of kin\u201d) (emphasis added); 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6717 (\u201cA unit of general local government which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 \n(\u201ca party\u201d to the order) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 7107 \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(\u201ca contractor\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263b (\u201cthe owner or \noperator\u201d) (emphasis added). \nA retailer thus easily falls within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. Bank of Am., 581 U.S. at 197 \n(\u201cclaims of financial injury \u2026 satisfy \u2026 \u2018prudential \nstanding\u2019\u201d). \nd. Looking at the statute more broadly reinforces \nthat retailers are within the zone of interests of both \nthe TCA as a whole and its premarket review \nprovisions in particular. Assessing this question, \ncourts generally ask whether the relevant statute \nregulates or protects the party. Calumet Indus., 807 \nF.2d at 228 (citing Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. \nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). If the \nstatute does, then the party is within the zone and \nhas statutory standing. Here, it is clear that the TCA \nboth regulates and protects retailers.  \nFirst, the TCA directly regulates retailers by: \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nthat FDA does not authorize, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 331, 387b(6); \n\u2022 authorizing seizures, fines, injunctions, and \ncriminal penalties against retailers who sell \nunauthorized products, id. \u00a7 334(a), (g); \n\u00a7 333(a), (f)(9)(A); \u00a7 332(a); \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nwith unauthorized \u201cmodified risk\u201d claims, \nid. \u00a7 387k(a); \n\u2022 requiring retailers to limit the location and \namount of any distribution of free samples \nof tobacco products, id. \u00a7 387a-1(d); \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any cigarette \nadvertisements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; and \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any smokeless \ntobacco product advertisements, id. \u00a7 4402.  \nAmong these numerous provisions, it is notable \nthat a denial order under the TCA dictates what \nproducts a retailer may sell. And FDA\u2019s enforcement \nefforts show that the statute means what it says. In \nannouncing its denial orders for menthol Vuse Vibe \nand Ciro, for example, FDA said that it \u201cintends to \nensure compliance by distributors and retailers.\u201d9 \nSimilarly, in announcing its denial order for menthol \nVuse Alto, FDA stated, \u201cIf the product is already on \nthe market, it must be removed from the market or \nrisk FDA enforcement.\u201d10 Moreover, in 2020, FDA \nwarned retailers it would enforce the TCA against \nthem.11 FDA has made good on that threat, issuing \nwarning letters and civil penalties to retailers who \nsold \nproducts \nthat \nreceived \nmarketing \ndenial \n \n9 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Two Vuse \nMenthol E-Cigarette Products Following Determination They Do \nNot \nMeet \nPublic \nHealth \nStandard \n(Jan. \n24, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4ck9644b (emphasis added). \n10 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Six Flavored \nVuse \nAlto \nE-Cigarette \nProducts \n(Oct. \n12, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5n8nb7c7. \n11 E.g., FDA, FDA Warns Manufacturers and Retailers \n(Apr. 27, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/uttfu7p7 (\u201cIf the recipients \nof these warning letters do not cease the manufacture, \ndistribution and/or sale of these unauthorized tobacco products, \nthey risk additional FDA action such as an injunction, seizure \nand/or civil money penalty actions.\u201d). \n\n \n15 \n \n \norders.12 Just this March, FDA announced that it \nhad issued warning letters to 61 retailers for selling \nunauthorized tobacco products.13 FDA also has \nsought and obtained injunctions against retailers. \nE.g., Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, \nUnited States v. Lucky Convenience & Tobacco, LLC, \nNo. 6:22-cv-1237 (D. Kan. Jan. 26, 2023). The TCA \nthus obviously regulates tobacco retailers.  \nSecond, the TCA also directly protects retailers by: \n\u2022 preserving retailers\u2019 ability to sell tobacco \nproducts by forbidding FDA from banning \nall cigarettes and certain other product \ncategories, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f; \n\u2022 providing retailers with an opportunity for a \nhearing prior to a no-tobacco-sale order, id. \n\u00a7 333(f)(8); \n\u2022 providing retailers with several procedural \nprotections \nregarding \ncertain \nalleged \nviolations of the Act, id. \u00a7 333 note; and \n\u2022 exempting \nretailers \nfrom \ncertain \nrecordkeeping \nrequirements, \nid. \n\u00a7 387t(b)(5). \nSignificantly for assessing whether retailers fall \nwithin the TCA\u2019s zone of interests, the Act expressly \ndeclares Congress\u2019s purpose \u201cto continue to permit \nthe sale of tobacco products to adults,\u201d including \n \n12 FDA, Advisory and Enforcement Actions Against \nIndustry \nfor \nUnauthorized \nTobacco \nProducts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mrxxt3ja (last visited July 2, 2024). \n13 FDA, FDA Warns 61 Brick and Mortar Retailers for \nthe Sale of Unauthorized E-Cigarettes Popular Among Youth \n(Mar. 26, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mpx2bjky. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nthrough retailers who comply with the TCA. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387 note.

L.L.C. fall outside \nthe Act\u2019s zone of interests when those entities are a \nconstant and integral subject of the Act\u2019s provisions. \ne. \nFor its part, FDA argues that \u201caspects of the \nstatutory structure demonstrate that the denial of a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application does not adversely affect \na seller.\u201d Pet. 11. But FDA only points to two \n(inapposite) provisions. The first provision is 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), where Congress provided that \nonly \u201cthe holder of an application\u201d may challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization. As noted \nabove, that provision cuts against FDA because \n\u201cCongress did not limit access to the courts for \nchallenging a denial order in the same way it did for \nthose challenging a withdrawal order.\u201d Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 5 (Feb. 2, 2024). This provision thus \ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to limit \njudicial review when it wanted to, and yet for the \ndenial of a premarket tobacco product application, \nauthorized a challenge by \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by it. See supra pp. 9\u201311. The second \nprovision to which FDA points is \u00a7 387f(c), where \nCongress \nlimited non-manufacturers\u2019 \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninformation \nunder \nthe \nFreedom \nof \nInformation Act. That provision, however, says \nnothing about\u2014and certainly does not contradict\u2014\nthe provision allowing judicial review by \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d Nor does FDA address the \nnumerous provisions that show beyond doubt that \nthe TCA regulates and protects retailers. See supra \npp. 12\u201314. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFDA\u2019s other counterarguments fare no better. FDA \nargues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cnullifies the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions.\u201d Pet. 15. According to FDA, \nthat is because a manufacturer can always find a \nretailer in a preferred circuit and sue there, rather \nthan in the manufacturer\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. \nCircuit. Even if so, the remedy would lie with \nCongress; FDA\u2019s argument does not authorize courts \nto ignore the statute\u2019s plain text. See SAS Inst. Inc. \nv. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1358 (2018) (\u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d).  \nFDA\u2019s argument is, in any event, wrong because \nthe fact that a manufacturer and some retailers may \njoin in a single petition does not render the Act\u2019s \nvenue restrictions a nullity. Venue must still be \nestablished. One petitioner must be located in the \nrelevant circuit unless it is the D.C. Circuit. See \nOrder Granting Mot. to Transfer, Shenzhen Yibo v. \nFDA, No. 24-60191 (5th Cir. May 20, 2024) (granting \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer Shenzhen Yibo\u2019s petition to \nthe D.C. Circuit because there was no local \nretailer).14 In addition, a manufacturer whose \nproducts are only sold in one area of the country \ncannot file wherever the manufacturer wants \nbecause retailers outside that one area would not be \nable to allege injuries in fact. For example, a \nVermont manufacturer that sells its own products \n(as many vape shops do) and is incorporated and \noperates only in Vermont cannot file a petition in the \n \n14 There undoubtedly will be cases where there will not \nbe a retailer who sells or wants to sell the denied product\u2014or at \nleast who is not motivated to pursue litigation. \n\n \n18 \n \n \nFifth Circuit. The venue provision thus operates to \nlimit available forums in that sort of case. But the \nTCA does not entirely shut out of court adversely \naffected retailers that wish to petition in their home \ncircuit. Indeed, under FDA\u2019s theory, a retailer could \nnever challenge a denial order\u2014a position that \nplainly conflicts with the statutory text.  \n2.  FDA poses an alternative argument, but it, too, \nmisses the mark. FDA argues that each petitioner \nmust independently establish venue, so that even if \nAvail and the Mississippi Association have statutory \nstanding and can establish venue, RJRV (which \nconcededly \nhas \nstatutory \nstanding) \nmay \nnot \nparticipate in the case but, instead, must file a \nseparate case in a different court challenging the \nsame denial order. Pet. 12\u201314. This argument is both \nforfeited and wrong. \na. \nAs an initial matter, FDA never advanced this \nargument below. While FDA did object to venue \nrepeatedly in the Fifth Circuit, FDA\u2019s argument was \nthat retailers could not sue at all under the TCA, and \nthat without them venue was not proper. FDA did \nnot, however, argue that each petitioner needed to \nindependently establish venue. That argument \nappeared nowhere in FDA\u2019s Motion to Transfer. It \nappeared \nnowhere \nin \nFDA\u2019s \nOpposition \nto \nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Stay. And it appeared \nnowhere in FDA\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc of \nthe Vibe stay order (or in any other filing). Because \nthis argument \u201cwas never presented to any lower \ncourt,\u201d it is \u201cforfeited.\u201d OBB Personenverkehr AG v. \nSachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 (2015); see also Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \n\n \n19 \n \n \nb. \nIn any event, FDA is wrong. Nothing in the \nstatutory language requires each petitioner to \nindividually establish venue. To the contrary, \nCongress enacted the TCA\u2019s venue provision against \na long-standing backdrop of similarly worded venue \nprovisions governing suits against the government, \nwhich federal courts have uniformly interpreted to \nmean that venue needs to be proper for only one \npetitioner or plaintiff.  \nThe Hobbs Act governs review in the courts of \nappeals of certain actions by a number of federal \nagencies. In language that clearly served as a model \nfor the TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision, the Hobbs \nAct provides that venue shall be \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its \nprincipal office\u201d (or in the D.C. Circuit). 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2343. Courts have uniformly interpreted this \nlanguage to mean that, as long as one petitioner \nresides or has its principal place of business within \nthe circuit, venue is proper for all petitioners. See, \ne.g., Global Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 \nn.1 (5th Cir. 1982); Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 549 F.2d 1186, 1187 n.1 (8th Cir. \n1977); Radio Relay Corp. v. FCC, 409 F.2d 322, 324 \n(2d Cir. 1969); Anglo Canadian Shipping Co. \nv. United States, 238 F.2d 18, 20 (9th Cir. 1956); see \nalso 16 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 3941 n.6 (4th ed. 2023) (\u201cWhen more \nthan one petitioner seeks review of the same order, \nthe venue opportunities may expand considerably.\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the general venue statute authorizes \nsuits against the federal government \u201cin any judicial \ndistrict in which \u2026 the plaintiff resides.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). For over five decades, federal courts \n\n \n20 \n \n \nhave uniformly interpreted that provision to mean \nthat venue can be established by any plaintiff. \nSidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, \n344\u201345 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cEach court faced with the \nsame issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d) (citing \ncases). The government agrees. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Civil Resource Manual 41 Venue (\u201cOnly one \nof the plaintiffs need reside in the district for venue \nto be proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(3).\u201d), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/58msjksk.15 \nThe TCA was enacted in 2009 against this \nlegislative backdrop. \u201cWhen administrative and \njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of \nan existing statutory provision, repetition of the \nsame language in a new statute indicates, as a \ngeneral matter, the intent to incorporate its \nadministrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201d \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). Thus, \nCongress did not intend for each petitioner to have to \nestablish venue individually under the TCA. Instead, \nif venue is proper for any one of the petitioners, then \nthe TCA\u2019s venue requirement is satisfied.   \n \n15 DOJ\u2019s Manual appears to have a typo\u2014the correct \nreference is \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393(e)(4),\u201d not (e)(3). Nonetheless, the \nstatute was amended in 2011 (after the manual was published), \nat which point \u00a7 1391(e)(4) became \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). The relevant \nlanguage remains the same. Federal Courts Jurisdiction and \nVenue Clarification Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-63, 125 Stat. \n758 (eff. Dec. 7, 2011).  \n\n \n21 \n \n \nThis longstanding and uniform interpretation, \nmoreover, \nmakes \nsense. \nOtherwise, \ndifferent \npetitioners would have to file separate lawsuits in \ndifferent courts challenging the same agency action. \nIndeed, in some situations, there could be a petition \nin every regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit. While \nthose petitions would be assigned to one circuit \neventually, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), there is no \nreason to force litigants and the court system to \nengage in this meaningless kabuki dance. When \nparties coordinate and file a single petition, it saves \neveryone time and resources (including FDA, which \nwill only have to respond to one petition). See Exxon \nCorp. v. FTC, 588 F.2d 895, 898\u201399 (3d Cir. 1978) \n(\u201c[R]equiring every plaintiff in an action against the \nfederal \ngovernment \nor \nan \nagent \nthereof \nto \nindependently meet section 1391(e)\u2019s standards \nwould result in an unnecessary multiplicity of \nlitigation. The language of the statute itself \nmandates no such narrow construction. There is no \nrequirement that all plaintiffs reside in the forum \ndistrict.\u201d), overruled on other grounds, Reifer v. \nWestport Ins. Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014); see \nalso Sidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 (collecting cases); \nQuarles v. Gen\u2019l Inv. & Dev. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n12 (D.D.C. 2003) (citing Exxon and finding that \nsection \n1391 \ncontains \n\u201ca \nfar \nless \nrestrictive \nrequirement\u201d than other venue statutes given the \nproblems inherent in suing government entities); Ry. \nLabor Execs.\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, \n958 F.2d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing Exxon with \napproval as to avoiding \u201cmultiplicity of similar suits \nin different courts\u201d).   \n\n \n22 \n \n \nLikewise, the longstanding interpretation makes \nsense when one considers the statutorily enumerated \nscope of relief when a denial order is challenged. The \nstatute expressly contemplates that an improper \ndenial order will be \u201cset[ ] aside.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(c). \nSo even if the manufacturer and retailer were to file \nseparate petitions to have a denial order set aside, \nthe end result (if either prevails) would be the same. \nAs such, there is no sensible reason to force the \nmanufacturer and retailer to sue in different forums. \nConversely, FDA\u2019s interpretation does not make \nsense because it would not even solve the problem \nthat FDA purports to identify. A retailer, for \nexample, could challenge a denial order for a product \nthat it sells in its home circuit within ten days of the \ndenial order. Then, after those ten days but before \nexpiration of the thirty-day statute of limitations, a \nmanufacturer could challenge the same denial order \nin its home circuit. The result: both petitions would \nbe consolidated in the court in which the retailer \nfiled, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, thus (i) landing the case \nwhere FDA (erroneously) claims it does not belong, \nand (ii) multiplying the work of the appellate courts. \nBecause nothing in the Act requires each \npetitioner \nchallenging \na \ndenial \norder \nto \nindependently establish venue, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision was correct. See Alto C.A. Amended Order \n(Feb. 2, 2024).  \nc. \nAttempting to support its (forfeited) venue-as-\nto-each-petitioner argument, FDA relies on two, \ncentury-old cases interpreting irrelevant statutes. \nSee Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890); Camp v. \nGress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). Neither case helps FDA.  \n\n \n23 \n \n \nIn both cases, the statute provided, \u201c[W]here the \njurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the \naction is between citizens of different states, suit \nshall be brought only in the district of the residence \nof either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d Smith, 133 \nU.S. at 317; Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. In Smith, two \nplaintiffs, one from Arkansas and one from Missouri, \nsued a Texan. The Court held that venue under the \ndiversity-jurisdiction provision was lacking because \nthe two plaintiffs were not from the same state. See \nid. (holding that the statute \u201cmakes no provision in \nterms for the case of two defendants or two plaintiffs \nwho are citizens of different states\u201d). In so holding, \nthe Smith Court looked to Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \nopinion in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, which established \nthe \ncomplete \ndiversity \nrule\u2014for \ndiversity \njurisdiction, no plaintiff can be from the same state \nas any defendant. 3 Cranch 267 (1806). Whatever the \nwisdom of that rule and Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \ninterpretation of the venue provision,16 the Court \nconsistently applied it when interpreting that venue \nstatute governing diversity jurisdiction; because \nCongress (in 1890) had not legislatively changed the \nrelevant language interpreted by Strawbridge, the \nSmith Court reasoned that Congress accepted the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation. Forty years later, Camp \nfollowed Smith and applied the same rule for \ndefendants in diversity cases\u2014they all had to be \nfrom the same state. Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. \n \n16 Strawbridge was doubted by even the Great Chief \nJustice himself. See Louisville C. & C.R Co. v. Letson, 43 U.S. \n497, 555\u201356 (1844) (Wayne, J.) (\u201c[b]y no one was the correctness \nof [Strawbridge and its progeny] more questioned than by the \nlate chief justice who gave them\u201d). \n\n \n24 \n \n \nSmith and Camp are plainly irrelevant here.   \nFirst, Smith and Camp dealt with a restrictive \nprovision that is no longer on the books. See Smith, \n133 U.S. at 319 (noting that \u201cthe purpose of the \nlegislature [was] to restrict rather than to enlarge \nthe jurisdiction of the circuit courts\u201d). Indeed, \u201cmuch \nhas changed since the Court\u2019s ruling in Smith.\u201d \nSidney Coal Co. v. Massanari, 221 F. Supp. 2d 755, \n764 (E.D. Ky. 2002). \n\u201c[W]hen Smith was decided, \u2026 the venue statute \nin effect today did not exist.\u201d Zumft v. Doney Slate \nCo., 698 F. Supp. 444, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \u201cIn 1966, \nto cure the problem created where the residences of \nco-plaintiffs or co-defendants made the proper laying \nof venue impossible, a venue statute providing for \ncommencement of an action in the district where the \nclaim arose was passed.\u201d Id. (citing Brunette Machine \nWorks, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, \n710 n.8 (1972)). Under that new statute, \u201cdismissal is \nnot necessarily required where venue cannot be \npremised on the parties\u2019 citizenship.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, diversity cases can now be heard where the \nclaim arose\u2014thus negating the need to look at \nparties\u2019 \nresidences \naltogether \nin \nsome \ncases. \nMoreover, \u201cthe statute at issue in Smith was \nsuperceded in 1966 by Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406, which provided district courts some \nflexibility when making a venue determination.\u201d \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 n.12. Specifically, \n\u00a7 1406 \u201cgives district courts discretion to either \ndismiss an improperly venued case or \u2018if it be in the \ninterest of justice\u2019 to transfer such case to any \ndistrict or division in which the case could have been \ncommenced.\u201d Zumft, 698 F. Supp. at 446. In other \n\n \n25 \n \n \nwords, even when it comes to diversity cases now, \nSmith \nhas \nlimited \napplication \ngiven \nthese \nintervening legislative changes.17  \nSecond, and more importantly, Smith and Camp \ndealt with venue in diversity cases\u2014not cases \nagainst the federal government. When it came to \nsuits against federal officials, there is a long and \nunbroken history establishing that today only one \nplaintiff needs to establish venue. Before 1962, \u201cthe \nlaw on the proper place of suit for actions against \nfederal \nofficers \nand \nagencies \nwas \nquite \nunsatisfactory.\u201d Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. \nEssentially, most plaintiffs had to sue in the District \nof Columbia. Id. To cure this \u201cevil\u201d as some put it, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. TVA, 459 \nF.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1972), Congress added 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which was intended \u201cto broaden the \nvenue of civil actions which could previously have \nbeen brought only in the District of Columbia.\u201d \nSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 489 (1971); \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 344\u201345 & n.12; see Wright \n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. In particular, the new \nstatute allowed the plaintiff to sue where \u201cthe \nplaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). As court after \ncourt concluded, \u201cinterpreting the phrase \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019 to mean \u2018all plaintiffs\u2019 or \u2018each plaintiff\u2019 \n \n17 Even before Smith, this Court recognized that \u201c[i]t is \nnot denied that under the constitutional provision as to the \njudicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, \nhave given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases \nbetween citizens of one or more states on one side, and citizens \nof one or more other states on the other side.\u201d Louisville, C. & \nC.R. Co., 43 U.S. at 500\u201301.  \n\n \n26 \n \n \nwould substantially limit the statute\u2019s breadth and \nundermine congressional intent.\u201d Sidney Coal, 427 \nF.3d at 344 (collecting cases). \u201cEach court faced with \nthe same issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d Id. at 344\u2013\n45. \u201cThus, Smith has no bearing on this Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of\u201d venue provisions governing actions \nagainst the federal government. Id. at 345 n.12. \nThird, the statutory language at issue in Smith \nand Camp is different from the TCA\u2019s venue \nprovision. The provision in Smith and Camp said, \n\u201csuit shall be brought only in the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added). But there \nis no similarly restrictive language in the TCA\u2019s \nvenue provision. It allows \u201cany adversely affected \nperson\u201d to sue in the circuit \u201cin which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Thus, Smith and Camp have no \napplication here.  \nFDA also looks for support in secondary sources to \nargue that \u201c[the Supreme] Court long ago held that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.\u201d Pet. 13 \n(quoting 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. 2023)). But if \nthe Agency read on, it would find that Wright & \nMiller addresses this situation\u2014civil actions against \nfederal agencies\u2014and explains, as detailed above, \nthat \u201c[i]n cases involving multiple plaintiffs, venue is \nproper where any one of them resides.\u201d Wright & \nMiller, supra, at \u00a7 3815 (emphasis added). In short, \nFDA is without support for its position.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \n* * * \nThis Court has long observed that it is the \n\u201c\u2018plaintiff\u2019s venue privilege,\u2019\u201d not the defendant\u2019s\u2014\nand certainly not the federal government\u2019s, with its \nnational omnipresence. Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Ct. W. Dist. Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) \n(quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 635 \n(1964)). Nothing about the TCA\u2019s venue provision \ndisplaces that settled privilege. It neither prohibits \nretailers from seeking relief in their home circuits to \nvindicate their own interests independent of a \nmanufacturer nor prohibits a manufacturer from \njoining retailers in their properly filed petitions.  \nRespondent Avail was formed and has its principal \nplace of business in Texas, and Respondent \nMississippi Association is incorporated and has its \nprincipal place of business in Mississippi. FDA does \nnot dispute those facts. Thus, the Fifth Circuit was \ncorrect to hold that venue is proper in that circuit. \nSee 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nII. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT AND THE \nALLEGED \n\u201cEFFECTS\u201d \nARE \nINCREASINGLY \nRARE. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not only correct, but \nthere is also no circuit conflict over either of the \nissues presented by this case. Pet. 17. Moreover, the \n\u201ceffects\u201d that FDA laments are overblown because \nthe Agency can only identify three petitions out of \ndozens in the almost year and a half since the Vibe \ndecision that it contends \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u2013\n17; see generally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing \nOrders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \n\n \n28 \n \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024). \n1.  FDA admits that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \ndoes not create a circuit conflict about the meaning of \nthe TCA\u2019s venue provision.\u201d Id. The Fifth Circuit is \nthe first and only circuit court to have analyzed \nwhether a retailer has statutory standing to invoke \nthe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision and, as explained \nabove, its analysis falls squarely within this Court\u2019s \nestablished precedent. See supra pp. 7\u20139. Indeed, as \nexplained, it accords with the uniform decisions of \nthe federal courts in related contexts. See supra pp. \n16\u201320. \nNevertheless, FDA attempts to manufacture a \n\u201cconflict\u201d as to its (forfeited) alternative argument \nthat \neach \npetitioner \nmust \nestablish \nvenue \nindependently. Pet. 14. In so doing, FDA invokes a \nsingle case, Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal \nPower Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), \nwhich was decided forty-five years before the TCA \nwas even enacted. FDA claims that Amerada \nPetroleum held that \u201cout-of-circuit companies could \nnot join a local company to seek review in that \ncircuit.\u201d Pet. 14. That is wrong. In Amerada \nPetroleum, the Court was faced with \u201cseparate \napplications [to the federal agency] of natural-gas \ncompanies,\u201d only one of which was located in the \nTenth Circuit. Id. at 810 (emphasis added). Because \nthe statute clearly contemplated a separate \u201corder \nrelating to [each] particular natural-gas company,\u201d \neach company needed to bring its own suit over each \norder, and thus independently satisfy venue. See id. \nHere, by contrast, all Respondents are \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by FDA\u2019s single order on one application. 21 \n\n \n29 \n \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1); see supra pp. 9\u201314. And so the \ngeneral rule that only one plaintiff needs to have \nvenue applies. See supra pp. 16\u201320. \n2.  The purported \u201ceffects\u201d of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision are also no reason for this Court to step in. \nPet. 16.  \nFor all of FDA\u2019s hand-wringing about \u201c[o]ther out-\nof-circuit manufacturers \u2026 using the same tactic to \nobtain judicial review of FDA orders in the Fifth \nCircuit,\u201d one would expect many more petitions like \nthis one. Id. It has been almost a year and a half \nsince the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit,\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at 188, and FDA can only \nidentify three petitions out of dozens filed since then \nthat it claims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 17; see \ngenerally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing Orders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024).18  \nMoreover, while FDA has issued hundreds of \nthousands of denial orders, see Vibe, 65 F.4th at 192 \n(\u201c[FDA] has denied over 355,000 such applications.\u201d), \nFDA had made \u201cdeterminations on more than 99% \n \n18 FDA identifies three petitions for judicial review it \nclaims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u201317. There now appear to be \nthree more petitions for judicial review in the Fifth Circuit with \na retailer establishing venue. See NicQuid LLC v. FDA, No. 24-\n60272 (5th Cir. Jun. 3, 2024); Breeze Smoke, LLC v. FDA, No. \n24-60304 (5th Cir. Jun. 12, 2024); Vertigo Vapor v. FDA, No. 24-\n60332 (5th Cir. Jun. 28, 2024). At best then, FDA can point to \nonly six petitions for judicial review (other than the Vuse \npetitions) out of hundreds of thousands of denial orders.  \n\n \n30 \n \n \nof\u201d applications filed by the time Vibe was decided.19 \nAnd, under the statute, petitions must be filed thirty \ndays after a denial order. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a). \nThus, \nthere \nwill \nnot\u2014indeed, \ncannot\u2014be \nan \nonslaught of petitions filed in the Fifth Circuit. \nWhile it is true that new tobacco products must seek \nauthorization, FDA\u2019s onerous requirements for \nmarketing authorization have made it such that few \nmanufacturers can even attempt to comply. Put \nanother way, fewer applications will mean fewer \npetitions for judicial review. \nEqually misplaced are FDA\u2019s claims about the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201ccontribut[ing] to a \u2018youth \nvaping epidemic.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023)). As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision simply relates to which \ncourt may decide the case; it does not dictate the \ncorrect substantive result in any case, let alone \ncontribute to an epidemic. Moreover, youth use has \ndropped by more than 25% since 2022.20 And Vuse, \nwhile the leading e\u2011cigarette among adults, is not \npopular among youth, ranking behind brands like Elf \nBar (three times more popular among youth than \nVuse) and Esco Bars, and continues to decline.21 \n \n19 FDA, FDA Makes Determinations On More Than 99% \nof the 26 Million Tobacco Products For Which Applications Were \nSubmitted (Mar. 15, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/yxcf2dfm. \n20 FDA, National Survey Shows Drop in E-Cigarette Use \nAmong \nHigh \nSchool \nStudents \n(Nov. \n2, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3nn4tvar. \n21 See Jan Birdsey, et al., Tobacco Product Use Among \nU.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014National Youth \nTobacco Survey, 2023, 72 MMWR 1173 (Nov. 2023). \n\n \n31 \n \n \nIndeed, only 1.5% of middle and high school students \nreported using any Vuse product last year.22 FDA \ncannot credibly claim that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nis contributing to any supposed youth vaping \nepidemic. \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE. \nEven if the question presented were otherwise \nworthy of this Court\u2019s attention, this petition would \nbe an exceedingly poor vehicle for answering it. First, \nthe specific interlocutory posture of this case is \nhighly irregular, requiring this Court to become the \nfirst appellate court to review a procedural order \n(because the case was originally filed in the court of \nappeals) and the first court to review the second \n(forfeited) question. Second, even if FDA were to \nprevail on the venue issue in this Court, the case \nwould not be over.  \n1.  The interlocutory posture of this case makes \nthe petition highly irregular. The general rule is that \na district court\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer on venue grounds is not immediately \nappealable. See, e.g., Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, \n490 U.S. 495, 498 (1989) (venue); Van Cauwenberghe \nv. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 519 (1988) (forum non \nconveniens). And while a different statute governs \ncertiorari before judgment in cases pending at the \ncourt of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the government \ncites no on-point case in which this Court has ever \ngranted review of an interlocutory venue decision in \nthis procedural posture. \n \n22 Birdsey, et al., supra. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nInstead, the government points to four other cases \nthat it says support review of the interlocutory \ndecision \nbelow. \nBut \neach \nof \nthese \ncases \nis \ndistinguishable.  \nTC Heartland, Walden, and Atlantic Marine all \ninvolved cases where the court of appeals had \nentered a final order or judgment for purposes of the \nappeal before it. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods \nGrp. Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 263 (2017) \n(mandamus); Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 291 \n(2014) (judgment); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54 \n(mandamus). This case is a far cry from those, as the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision below merely entered an \ninterlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in a case filed in the court of appeals in the \nfirst instance.  \nThe closest the government comes is Mercantile \nNational Bank v. Langdeau. But that case analyzed \na prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, which lays out a \nseparate standard for certiorari review of final \njudgments from state courts. The Court held in that \nparticular case that \u00a7 1257 was satisfied because a \nstate supreme court had issued a final order on \nvenue, the only federal issue in the case\u2014and \npetitioner had made a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d that a \n\u201cfederal statute\u201d \u201cprohibit[ed] further proceedings \nagainst the defendants in the state court in which \nthe suit is now pending.\u201d 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963). In \nother words, the venue decision meant that the only \nfederal question had been addressed and it was thus \nsufficiently final for purposes of federal review. Here, \nhowever, this case remains pending in the Fifth \nCircuit and has not proceeded to final judgment. Pet. \n19 (conceding that \u201cno final judgment on the merits \n\n \n33 \n \n \nhas been entered\u201d). Unlike in Mercantile, there are a \nlitany of other federal issues that will be pressed and \npassed upon before final judgment, meaning that \nthis cannot be characterized as a final federal \njudgment. Cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 501 \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s interlocutory appeal to \nenforce a forum-selection clause \u201cdoes not fall \nwithin \u2026 the collateral order doctrine\u201d). \nAs to the second question, FDA\u2019s petition is even \nmore irregular. As noted above, FDA has forfeited \nthis issue; the Agency never presented its argument \nbefore the Fifth Circuit. See supra p. 16; Sachs, 577 \nU.S. at 37. Because the Fifth Circuit did not have the \nchance to pass upon the question, this Court would \neffectively be stepping in as the court of first review. \nFDA cites no case where this Court has granted \nreview under such circumstances. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not finally \nresolve this case. As even FDA concedes, the Fifth \nCircuit has not decided the merits or rendered final \njudgment. According to Rule 11, then, review is \npresumptively inappropriate. See Sup. Ct. R. 11. Yet \nthe \ngovernment \ndoes \nnot \nexplain \nwhy \nthe \ninterlocutory order addressing venue \u201cis of such \nimperative \npublic \nimportance \nas \nto \nrequire \nimmediate determination in this Court.\u201d Id. (citing \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(e)). That is particularly notable \nbecause \nFDA \nhas \nalready \nresolved \n99% \nof \napplications filed by September 9, 2020, and the time \nto challenge such denials has long since run. See \nsupra at p. 26. The universe of cases in which this \nissue can now arise is therefore tiny, and if it is as \nimportant as FDA claims, can be resolved after final \njudgment. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nIn addition, even if this Court concluded that \nretailers lack statutory standing, FDA would not be \nentitled to the result it seeks\u2014transfer or dismissal. \nVenue is not lost even if the party whose presence \nwas necessary for venue is dismissed from the case. \nSee, e.g., Exxon, 588 F.2d at 899; Horihan v. Hartford \nIns. Co., 979 F. Supp. 1073, 1076 (E.D. Tex. 1997). \nThe exception is where a party\u2019s claims are frivolous \nor joinder is fraudulent. See Wright & Miller, supra, \nat \u00a7 3815 n.40 (collecting cases). FDA does not \ncontend either here. Cf. B, Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., \n663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1981); Honey Holdings I, \nLtd. v. Alfred L. Wolff, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 3d 543, 558 \nn.16 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Nor could it, especially since \nthe Fifth Circuit has upheld retailers\u2019 rights to assert \nthe claims at issue.  \nFurther, if FDA were to prevail on its alternative \nargument (that each party must establish venue), \nthe case would still continue.23 At best for FDA, \nRJRV and RJR Vapor Co. would be dismissed from \nthe case. But that would not affect the retailers\u2019 case. \nAnd if the retailers are successful, the denial order \nwill \nbe \nvacated, \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthe \nmanufacturers are parties.  \nIn short, even if FDA were to prevail in this Court, \nthe case would neither be dismissed nor transferred.  \n \n23 This Court has granted review in FDA v. Wages & \nWhite Lion, No. 23-1038, which raises many of the same merits \nissues as Respondents\u2019 case. But granting Wages does not \nchange anything about FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari in this case, \nwhich should plainly be denied for the reasons state above. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n \nJuly 3, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nNOEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case remains centered on the legal question of whether retailers are \"adversely affected\" by an FDA marketing denial issued to a manufacturer, thereby granting them standing and the ability to establish venue for judicial review under the Tobacco Control Act.\n\nThe previous observation of the Petitioner's (FDA's) brief provided a detailed map of the government's legal strategy. My beliefs incorporate these specific arguments:\n\n*   **Refined Legal Questions & Strategy:** The government has framed the issue as one of improper venue and forum shopping, asking: \"Whether a manufacturer may file a petition for review in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it neither resides nor has its principal place of business, if the petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s products that is located within that circuit.\"\n\n*   **Petitioner's Core Arguments (Standing & Venue):**\n    1.  **Retailers Lack a Right to Review (\"Zone of Interests\"):** The FDA's primary argument is that retailers are not \"adversely affected\" in a legally cognizable way because their economic interests fall outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the Tobacco Control Act's premarket review provisions (21 U.S.C. 387j). The government asserts the statutory scheme's focus on the manufacturer-applicant implies Congress intended to limit review to that party alone.\n    2.  **Improper Venue & Joinder:** The secondary argument is that venue must be proper for each petitioner individually. The government contends that traditional principles of joinder do not permit one party (the manufacturer) to \"piggyback\" on another's (the retailer's) proper venue.\n\n*   **Key Precedents Cited by Petitioner (FDA):**\n    *   On the \"zone of interests\" and who is \"adversely affected\": ***Block v. Community Nutrition Institute* (1984)**, ***Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.* (2014)**, and ***Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.* (1995)**.\n    *   On venue and joinder: ***Smith v. Lyon* (1890)** and the recent textualist venue case, ***TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC* (2017)**.\n\n*   **Consequences Argument:** The FDA argues that affirming the Fifth Circuit would \"effectively nullify\" the Act's venue limitations, opening the door to widespread forum shopping by manufacturers.\n\nThe most recent observation was a \"THINK\" action, representing an internal reasoning step by the agent. It confirmed that after analyzing the petitioner's brief, the most critical next step is to acquire and analyze the respondents' (R.J. Reynolds and the retailers) merits brief. This observation did not introduce new facts, evidence, or legal arguments about the case itself. Therefore, my task-level beliefs remain stable, as no new substantive information has been provided.\n\n*   **Belief Stability:** My detailed understanding of the FDA's legal and policy arguments is unchanged. The precedents they rely on and their strategic framing of the issue remain the core of my belief about their position.\n*   **Key Information Needed (Unchanged):** The latest observation reinforces the critical nature of the existing information gap. My predictive model is still awaiting the counterarguments from the respondents. I need to see their brief to understand:\n    1.  How they will argue that a retailer's direct economic harm places them within the \"zone of interests\" of the Tobacco Control Act.\n    2.  How they will distinguish or reinterpret the precedents cited by the FDA, especially *Block*.\n    3.  Their legal theory justifying why a single petitioner's proper venue should extend to the entire joint petition.\n    4.  How they will counter the FDA's powerful \"forum shopping\" narrative.\n\nMy current belief state is a well-defined but one-sided view of the legal battle. The next observation of the respondents' brief will be essential for creating a balanced and complete picture of the arguments the Supreme Court will consider.",

The single most important piece of missing information is how the Petitioner (the FDA) will respond. The reply brief is their final opportunity to persuade the Court to grant certiorari. Observing it will directly inform my prediction on the cert grant by revealing: (1) how the FDA counters the simple textualist argument ('any person adversely affected'), (2) how it justifies seeking review without a circuit split, and (3) how it refutes the charge of bringing an improper interlocutory appeal. The potential for a significant belief update is very high, making the Task EIG substantial. For Design EIG, this action provides a classic, generalizable example of the strategic 'cert-stage dance,' specifically how the Solicitor General's office attempts to overcome strong procedural hurdles to secure review.

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONER \n \nIf the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denies \nan application for authorization to market a new tobacco \nproduct, an adversely affected person may seek judicial \nreview in the circuit where it is based.  See 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1)(B).  But in the decision below, the Fifth Cir-\ncuit held that a manufacturer may seek review in a cir-\ncuit where it is not based, so long as it is joined by an in-\ncircuit seller of its products.  That decision lacks merit \nand effectively nullifies the statute\u2019s limits on venue.  It \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review because it undercuts the \nauthority of other courts of appeals and, in conjunction \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s other decisions, has serious con-\nsequences for public health.  And contrary to respond-\nents\u2019 contention, this case is an appropriate vehicle for \nresolving the question presented.  This Court should \ngrant the petition for a writ of certiorari. \n\n2 \n \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \n1. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act (Tobacco Control Act or Act), Pub. L. No. \n111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, allows an \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d person to obtain judicial review of an FDA order \ndenying an application for marketing authorization.  21 \nU.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  FDA\u2019s denial of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication does not \u201cadversely affect\u201d a retail seller of \nthat manufacturer\u2019s products.  \nRespondents do not deny that the phrase \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d is a term of art; that it requires a person to \nshow that its interests fall within the zone of interests \nprotected by the statute; or that the zone\u2019s scope de-\npends on the statute\u2019s structure.  See Pet. 9.  The To-\nbacco Control Act\u2019s structure shows that a retailer may \nnot challenge the denial of a manufacturer\u2019s application.  \nRespondents do not dispute that the Act requires FDA \nto maintain the confidentiality of manufacturers\u2019 appli-\ncations, or that only the manufacturer is entitled to no-\ntice of FDA\u2019s denial order.  See Pet. 10.  Respondents \nfail to explain why Congress would have granted retail-\ners the right to challenge denial orders, but not the \nright to receive notice of those orders.  Nor do they ex-\nplain how a retailer could meaningfully challenge a de-\nnial without access to the underlying application. \nThis case illustrates the point.  Respondents claim \nthat FDA unfairly surprised R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. \n(Reynolds) by changing the evidentiary standard under \nwhich it evaluated Reynolds\u2019 applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  Yet they fail to explain how Reynolds\u2019 retailers \n\u2014who, under the statute, are privy to neither Reynolds\u2019 \napplication nor FDA\u2019s order\u2014could raise such a claim. \n\n3 \n \nRespondents emphasize (Br. in Opp. 12-15) that the \nAct regulates retailers, including by prohibiting them \nfrom selling unauthorized tobacco products.  But the \nAct gives retailers no role in FDA\u2019s authorization of a \ntobacco product in the first place.  And respondents con-\ncede (Br. in Opp. 11) that the Act precludes retailers \nfrom seeking judicial review of an order in which FDA \nwithdraws marketing authorization that it previously \ngranted.  Withdrawals of a manufacturer\u2019s authoriza-\ntion, which require retailers to stop previously lawful \nsales, affect retailers\u2019 interests more directly than deni-\nals.  See Pet. App. 7a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  Re-\nspondents fail to explain why Congress would have al-\nlowed retailers to challenge denials, yet prohibited \nthem from challenging withdrawals.   \nThis case, at bottom, involves an agency order issued \nin response to a particular person\u2019s application.  Only \nthat person is properly regarded as adversely affected \nby an order denying its application.  Any interests of \nother parties, such as retailers, are entirely derivative \nof, and adequately protected by, the applicants\u2019 inter-\nests.  By contrast, if FDA issues a rule that directly reg-\nulates retailers, then an \u201cadversely affected\u201d retailer \nmay seek review.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(A). \nEssentially ignoring the Tobacco Control Act\u2019s basic \nstructure, respondents principally rely (Br. in Opp. 8-9) \non dictionary definitions of the words \u201cadversely\u201d and \n\u201caffected\u201d and on this Court\u2019s decisions in Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209 (2012), and Bank of America \nCorp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189 (2017).  None of \nthose sources has any bearing on this case.  The phrase \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d is a legal term of art, see Director, \n\n4 \n \nOffice of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport \nNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 \n(1995), and a court must interpret such a term of art in \naccordance with its \u201cordinary legal meaning,\u201d which \n\u201coften differs\u201d from the \u201ccommon meaning\u201d reflected in \nnon-legal dictionaries, Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gar-\nner, Reading Law \u00a7 6, at 73 (2012) (emphasis added).  \nPatchak involved prudential standing under the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq., see \n567 U.S. at 224-225, and this Court has explained that \n\u201cwhat comes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of  * * *  the APA may not do so for other pur-\nposes,\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997).  Bank \nof America involved a suit under the Fair Housing Act \n(FHA), 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., which contains a special \ndefinition of \u201caggrieved person\u201d that is even broader \nthan that term\u2019s customary legal meaning.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 3602(i); Bank of America, 581 U.S. at 197-199. \n2. The Fifth Circuit compounded its error by hold-\ning that an out-of-circuit manufacturer may seek judi-\ncial review in the circuit so long as it is joined by an in-\ncircuit retailer.  The Tobacco Control Act provides that \n\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may file a petition for \nreview in \u201cthe circuit in which such person resides or \nhas their principal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1) (emphasis added).  As the words \u201csuch per-\nson\u201d indicate, a person may file a petition in a circuit \nonly if that person resides or has its principal place of \nbusiness there.  Respondents in effect rewrite the stat-\nute to allow a person to file a petition in \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person or a retail seller of such person\u2019s \nproducts resides or has its principal place of business.\u201d   \n\n5 \n \nRespondents attempt (Br. in Opp. 24) to dismiss, as \n\u201cplainly irrelevant,\u201d this Court\u2019s decisions establishing \nthe default rule that, in multi-party cases, \u201ceach plain-\ntiff must be competent to sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant \nmust be liable to be sued\u201d in the chosen venue.  Smith \nv. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315, 319 (1890); see Camp v. Gress, \n250 U.S. 308, 311-316 (1919).  Respondents instead em-\nphasize (Br. in Opp. 19-20, 25-26) instances in which \nlower courts and treatise authors have read two other \nvenue statutes, 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(C) and 28 U.S.C. \n2343, to allow multiple plaintiffs or petitioners to sue the \nfederal government so long as venue is proper as to one \nof them.  But the decisions applying Section 1391(e)(1)(C) \nrelied on that statute\u2019s legislative history\u2014specifically, \n\u201cthe hearing transcripts of the House Committee on the \nJudiciary,\u201d which purportedly showed that Congress \nenacted that provision with the \u201cspecific purpose of eas-\ning plaintiffs\u2019 burdens when suing government enti-\nties.\u201d  Sidney Coal Co. v. SSA, 427 F.3d 336, 344 (6th \nCir. 2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1020 (2006).  And the \ndecisions that respondents cite concerning Section 2343 \nprovided no legal analysis at all in concluding that venue \nneed be proper only as to a single petitioner.  See, e.g., \nGlobal Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 n.1 (5th \nCir. 1982).  Those decisions carry little weight in the in-\nterpretation of the Tobacco Control Act. \nFinally, respondents complain (Br. in Opp. 21) that, \nunder the government\u2019s interpretation, \u201cpetitioners \nwould have to file separate lawsuits in different courts \nchallenging the same agency action.\u201d  But the Act allows \nparties to seek judicial review in the D.C. Circuit re-\ngardless of whether they reside or have their principal \nplaces of business there.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  If \n\n6 \n \nparties from different circuits wish to file a single peti-\ntion for review in a single circuit, they could always avail \nthemselves of that option.  In addition, separate peti-\ntions filed in different circuits could be consolidated in \na single circuit.  See 28 U.S.C. 2112.  \n3. As Judge Higginson\u2019s dissent explained, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision effectively nullifies the statute\u2019s limits \non venue.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Respondents argue (Br. \nin Opp. 17-18 & n.14) that a manufacturer can benefit \nfrom the decision below only if its products are sold out-\nside its home circuit\u2014and that the venue provision can \nstill do some work in cases where a manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts are sold in only one circuit or where no retailer \nwants to sell them anywhere.  In other words, respond-\nents suggest that Congress affirmatively enabled forum \nshopping by large manufacturers whose products are \nsold nationwide, though not by small manufacturers \nwhose products are sold only \u201cin one area.\u201d  Id. at 17.  \nBut if Congress meant to allow a manufacturer to sue \nwherever its products are sold, it would have said so.  \nCongress instead authorized a person to seek judicial \nreview only where it \u201cresides\u201d or has its \u201cprincipal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The decision below \nnegates that congressional choice.   \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review, \nAnd This Case Is A Suitable Vehicle For Resolving It \n1. Respondents do not dispute that the Fifth Circuit \nhas resolved the venue issue in a published opinion and \nnow regards that issue as settled.  See Pet. 15-16.  In-\ndeed, respondents have already filed amicus briefs in \nthe Fifth Circuit contending that the court has \u201cre-\njected FDA\u2019s venue arguments\u201d in a \u201cpublished opin-\n\n7 \n \nion\u201d and in \u201cunpublished orders\u201d; that the \u201cpublished \nholding on venue\u201d \u201cis binding\u201d; and that the \u201cprior rul-\nings control.\u201d  Reynolds et al. Amicus Br. at 2, 4, Shen-\nzhen Youme Information Tech. Co. v. FDA, No. 24-\n60060 (5th Cir. June 14, 2024) (Resp. Shenzhen Youme \nAmicus Br.); see Reynolds et al. Amicus Br. at 2, 4, \nShenzhen IVPS Tech. Co. v. FDA, No. 24-60032 (5th \nCir. May 24, 2024). \nAlthough respondents recently told the Fifth Circuit \nthat it has \u201crepeatedly resolved this issue against \nFDA,\u201d Resp. Shenzhen Youme Amicus Br. at 2, they \nnow claim that the venue issue arises only \u201crare[ly],\u201d \nBr. in Opp. 27 (capitalization omitted).  That is incor-\nrect.  In the petition for a writ of certiorari (at 16-17), \nwe cited six petitions for review\u2014including three from \nReynolds alone\u2014filed in the Fifth Circuit using the ma-\nneuver approved in the decision below.  That total has \nsince grown to nine.  In June 2024, NicQuid (an Ohio \nmanufacturer), Breeze Smoke (a Michigan manufac-\nturer), and Vertigo Vapor (a Washington manufacturer) \nall filed petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit joined \nby their Texas distributors.  See Pet. for Review at 1-2, \nNicQuid, LLC v. FDA, No. 24-60272 (5th Cir. June 3, \n2024); Pet. for Review at 1-2, Breeze Smoke, LLC v. \nFDA, No. 24-60304 (5th Cir. June 14, 2024); Pet. for Re-\nview at 1-2, Vertigo Vapor LLC v. FDA, No. 24-60332 \n(5th Cir. June 28, 2024).  That trend is likely to continue \nunless this Court intervenes.  \nRespondents seek to minimize the importance of that \ntrend by observing (Br. in Opp. 29) that FDA has denied \nmarketing authorization for \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of \nnew tobacco products.  But that figure is misleading:  A \nsingle manufacturer sometimes seeks authorization to \n\n8 \n \nmarket thousands of products.  See, e.g., FDA, News \nRelease, FDA Denies Marketing Applications for \nAbout 55,000 Flavored E-Cigarette Products for Fail-\ning to Provide Evidence They Appropriately Protect \nPublic Health 1 (Aug. 26, 2021) (describing decisions \nabout \u201c55,000 flavored [e-cigarette] products from three \napplicants\u201d).  And the entities that have taken ad-\nvantage of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision include some of \nthe Nation\u2019s largest manufacturers.  For instance, \nReynolds claims (Br. in Opp. 30) that its products are \n\u201cnot popular among youth,\u201d but the study it cites for \nthat proposition estimates that 420,000 middle- and \nhigh-school students used Reynolds\u2019 Vuse e-cigarette \nproducts in 2023, making Vuse the third most popular \ne-cigarette brand among youth.  See Jan Birdsey et al., \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health and Human Servs., Tobacco Product Use \nAmong U.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014 \nNational Youth Tobacco Survey, 2023, 72 Morbidity \nand Mortality Weekly Report 1180 (Nov. 3, 2023). \nRespondents insist (Br. in Opp. 28-29) that this \nCourt should nonetheless deny review because the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision does not create a circuit conflict.  As \nan initial matter, the decision conflicts with Amerada \nPetroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commission, 338 \nF.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), which held that a materially \nidentical venue provision did not permit out-of-circuit \ncompanies to seek review alongside an in-circuit com-\npany.  Respondents seek to distinguish Amerada Petro-\nleum as a case involving \u201c\u200a\u2018separate applications,\u2019\u200a\u201d ra-\nther than a \u201csingle order on one application,\u201d Br. in Opp. \n28 (brackets, citation, and emphases omitted), but the \nagency had consolidated the separate applications and \n\n9 \n \nissued a single order resolving them.  See 338 F.2d at \n809-810.  And respondents\u2019 theory\u2014that \u201c[n]othing in \nthe statutory language requires each petitioner to indi-\nvidually establish venue,\u201d Br. in Opp. 19\u2014does not dis-\ntinguish between an order denying separate applica-\ntions and one denying a single application.   \nEven putting aside Amerada Petroleum, this Court \nshould grant review.  Out-of-circuit manufacturers, in-\ncluding Reynolds, have repeatedly evaded adverse \nprecedent in the D.C. Circuit and their home circuits by \nenlisting retailers to join petitions for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  The Fifth Circuit, for its part, has repeat-\nedly approved that tactic.  Regardless of whether the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decisions create a circuit conflict, they \nundermine the venue provision and the authority of \nother circuits in a manner that warrants this Court\u2019s in-\ntervention. \nFinally, as respondents\u2019 and other manufacturers\u2019 \ndecisions to file petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit \ndemonstrate, manufacturers regard that circuit as a \nuniquely favorable forum in which to litigate against \nFDA.  Now that the Fifth Circuit has approved a tactic \nthat enables any out-of-circuit entity to file a petition \nfor review there, it is unlikely that any manufacturer \nwill feel the need to try the same tactic in other circuits, \nthat the venue issue will percolate in those circuits, or \nthat a circuit conflict will ever develop.  In such circum-\nstances, the absence of a circuit conflict should not dis-\nsuade the Court from granting review. \n2. Contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion (Br. in Opp. \n31-34), this case is a suitable vehicle for resolving the \nquestion presented.  To start, respondents simply err in \nsaying (id. at 5, 33) that FDA is asking this Court to \n\n10 \n \ngrant certiorari before judgment\u2014i.e., to review a dis-\ntrict court\u2019s decision before the court of appeals has \nacted.  Rather, FDA is asking the Court to review a \ncourt of appeals\u2019 interlocutory decision\u2014specifically, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss \nin Alto.  See Pet. 6.  Respondents claim (Br. in Opp. 31) \nthat this Court has never previously granted certiorari \n\u201cin this procedural posture,\u201d but the Court did just that \nin National Association of Manufacturers v. Depart-\nment of Defense, 583 U.S. 109 (2018), and has on many \nother occasions reviewed venue questions in an interloc-\nutory posture.  See Pet. 19-21.  \nRespondents also err in arguing (Br. in Opp. 5, 18, \n33) that FDA has forfeited its secondary contention that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.  \u201cOnce a federal \nclaim is properly presented, a party can make any argu-\nment in support of that claim; parties are not limited to \nthe precise arguments they made below.\u201d  Yee v. City of \nEscondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534 (1992).  Respondents do \nnot dispute that FDA preserved its venue claim in the \nFifth Circuit.   \nIn any event, this Court may consider an issue that \nwas \u201cpressed or passed upon below.\u201d  United States v. \nWilliams, 504 U.S. 36, 41 (1992) (emphasis added; cita-\ntion omitted).  Contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion (Br. \nin Opp. 33), the Fifth Circuit plainly passed upon the \nquestion whether venue must be proper as to each \nparty; it held in Alto that venue was proper because \n\u201ctwo of the [four] Petitioners  * * *  have their principal \nplaces of business in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d  Pet. App. 3a.  \nBy the time FDA moved to dismiss in Alto, moreover, \nthe Fifth Circuit had already held, in its published opin-\nion in Vibe, that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit\u201d so long \n\n11 \n \nas \u201ca petitioner\u201d is based there.  R.J. Reynolds, 65 F.4th \nat 188 (emphasis added).  It would have been futile for \nFDA to argue in Alto that venue must be proper as to \neach party.  \nRespondents further contend (Br. in Opp. 18) that \nFDA did not adequately argue in Vibe that venue must \nbe proper as to each party.  But because FDA is asking \nthis Court to review the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order in Alto, \nnot its order in Vibe, any purported forfeiture in Vibe is \nbeside the point.  And although FDA did not specifically \nargue that venue must be proper as to each party when \nit first raised venue in its emergency stay briefing in \nVibe, the Fifth Circuit reached out, resolved that un-\nbriefed issue, and held in a published opinion that \n\u201cvenue is proper in this circuit\u201d so long as \u201ca petitioner\u201d \nis based there.  Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 188 (emphasis \nadded).  Thus, in Vibe, as here, the question whether \nvenue must be proper as to each party was \u201cpassed upon \nbelow.\u201d  Williams, 504 U.S. at 41.  \nFinally, respondents err in contending (Br. in Opp. \n34) that Reynolds may continue litigating in the Fifth \nCircuit even if the retailers are dismissed from the case.  \nThe cases cited by respondents state only that \u201cvenue \nis determined at the outset of the litigation\u201d and that a \ncase that was \u201cproperly venued\u201d \u201cis not affected by a \nsubsequent change in parties.\u201d  Exxon Corp. v. FTC, \n588 F.2d 895, 898-899 (3d Cir. 1978).  But this case was \nnot \u201cproperly venued\u201d \u201cat the outset of the litigation,\u201d \nibid.; rather, for the reasons discussed above, venue has \nbeen improper from the beginning.  At any rate, be-\ncause the Fifth Circuit did not rely on that alternative \nrationale, this Court would not need to address it if it \ngrants the petition for a writ of certiorari.   \n\n12 \n \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

See 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1)(B).  But in the decision below, the Fifth Cir-\ncuit held that a manufacturer may seek review in a cir-\ncuit where it is not based, so long as it is joined by an in-\ncircuit seller of its products.  That decision lacks merit \nand effectively nullifies the statute\u2019s limits on venue.  It \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review because it undercuts the \nauthority of other courts of appeals and, in conjunction \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s other decisions, has serious con-\nsequences for public health.  And contrary to respond-\nents\u2019 contention, this case is an appropriate vehicle for \nresolving the question presented.  This Court should \ngrant the petition for a writ of certiorari. \n\n2 \n \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \n1. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act (Tobacco Control Act or Act), Pub. L. No. \n111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, allows an \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d person to obtain judicial review of an FDA order \ndenying an application for marketing authorization.  21 \nU.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  FDA\u2019s denial of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication does not \u201cadversely affect\u201d a retail seller of \nthat manufacturer\u2019s products.  \nRespondents do not deny that the phrase \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d is a term of art; that it requires a person to \nshow that its interests fall within the zone of interests \nprotected by the statute; or that the zone\u2019s scope de-\npends on the statute\u2019s structure.  See Pet. 9.  The To-\nbacco Control Act\u2019s structure shows that a retailer may \nnot challenge the denial of a manufacturer\u2019s application.  \nRespondents do not dispute that the Act requires FDA \nto maintain the confidentiality of manufacturers\u2019 appli-\ncations, or that only the manufacturer is entitled to no-\ntice of FDA\u2019s denial order.  See Pet. 10.  Respondents \nfail to explain why Congress would have granted retail-\ners the right to challenge denial orders, but not the \nright to receive notice of those orders.  Nor do they ex-\nplain how a retailer could meaningfully challenge a de-\nnial without access to the underlying application. \nThis case illustrates the point.  Respondents claim \nthat FDA unfairly surprised R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. \n(Reynolds) by changing the evidentiary standard under \nwhich it evaluated Reynolds\u2019 applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  Yet they fail to explain how Reynolds\u2019 retailers \n\u2014who, under the statute, are privy to neither Reynolds\u2019 \napplication nor FDA\u2019s order\u2014could raise such a claim. \n\n3 \n \nRespondents emphasize (Br. in Opp. 12-15) that the \nAct regulates retailers, including by prohibiting them \nfrom selling unauthorized tobacco products.  But the \nAct gives retailers no role in FDA\u2019s authorization of a \ntobacco product in the first place.  And respondents con-\ncede (Br. in Opp. 11) that the Act precludes retailers \nfrom seeking judicial review of an order in which FDA \nwithdraws marketing authorization that it previously \ngranted.  Withdrawals of a manufacturer\u2019s authoriza-\ntion, which require retailers to stop previously lawful \nsales, affect retailers\u2019 interests more directly than deni-\nals.  See Pet. App. 7a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  Re-\nspondents fail to explain why Congress would have al-\nlowed retailers to challenge denials, yet prohibited \nthem from challenging withdrawals.   \nThis case, at bottom, involves an agency order issued \nin response to a particular person\u2019s application.  Only \nthat person is properly regarded as adversely affected \nby an order denying its application.  Any interests of \nother parties, such as retailers, are entirely derivative \nof, and adequately protected by, the applicants\u2019 inter-\nests.  By contrast, if FDA issues a rule that directly reg-\nulates retailers, then an \u201cadversely affected\u201d retailer \nmay seek review.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(A). \nEssentially ignoring the Tobacco Control Act\u2019s basic \nstructure, respondents principally rely (Br. in Opp. 8-9) \non dictionary definitions of the words \u201cadversely\u201d and \n\u201caffected\u201d and on this Court\u2019s decisions in Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209 (2012), and Bank of America \nCorp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189 (2017).  None of \nthose sources has any bearing on this case.  The phrase \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d is a legal term of art, see Director, \n\n4 \n \nOffice of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport \nNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 \n(1995), and a court must interpret such a term of art in \naccordance with its \u201cordinary legal meaning,\u201d which \n\u201coften differs\u201d from the \u201ccommon meaning\u201d reflected in \nnon-legal dictionaries, Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gar-\nner, Reading Law \u00a7 6, at 73 (2012) (emphasis added).  \nPatchak involved prudential standing under the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq., see \n567 U.S. at 224-225, and this Court has explained that \n\u201cwhat comes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of  * * *  the APA may not do so for other pur-\nposes,\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997).  Bank \nof America involved a suit under the Fair Housing Act \n(FHA), 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., which contains a special \ndefinition of \u201caggrieved person\u201d that is even broader \nthan that term\u2019s customary legal meaning.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 3602(i); Bank of America, 581 U.S. at 197-199. \n2. The Fifth Circuit compounded its error by hold-\ning that an out-of-circuit manufacturer may seek judi-\ncial review in the circuit so long as it is joined by an in-\ncircuit retailer.  The Tobacco Control Act provides that \n\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may file a petition for \nreview in \u201cthe circuit in which such person resides or \nhas their principal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1) (emphasis added).  As the words \u201csuch per-\nson\u201d indicate, a person may file a petition in a circuit \nonly if that person resides or has its principal place of \nbusiness there.  Respondents in effect rewrite the stat-\nute to allow a person to file a petition in \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person or a retail seller of such person\u2019s \nproducts resides or has its principal place of business.\u201d   \n\n5 \n \nRespondents attempt (Br. in Opp. 24) to dismiss, as \n\u201cplainly irrelevant,\u201d this Court\u2019s decisions establishing \nthe default rule that, in multi-party cases, \u201ceach plain-\ntiff must be competent to sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant \nmust be liable to be sued\u201d in the chosen venue.  Smith \nv. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315, 319 (1890); see Camp v. Gress, \n250 U.S. 308, 311-316 (1919).  Respondents instead em-\nphasize (Br. in Opp. 19-20, 25-26) instances in which \nlower courts and treatise authors have read two other \nvenue statutes, 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(C) and 28 U.S.C. \n2343, to allow multiple plaintiffs or petitioners to sue the \nfederal government so long as venue is proper as to one \nof them.  But the decisions applying Section 1391(e)(1)(C) \nrelied on that statute\u2019s legislative history\u2014specifically, \n\u201cthe hearing transcripts of the House Committee on the \nJudiciary,\u201d which purportedly showed that Congress \nenacted that provision with the \u201cspecific purpose of eas-\ning plaintiffs\u2019 burdens when suing government enti-\nties.\u201d  Sidney Coal Co. v. SSA, 427 F.3d 336, 344 (6th \nCir. 2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1020 (2006).  And the \ndecisions that respondents cite concerning Section 2343 \nprovided no legal analysis at all in concluding that venue \nneed be proper only as to a single petitioner.  See, e.g., \nGlobal Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 n.1 (5th \nCir. 1982).  Those decisions carry little weight in the in-\nterpretation of the Tobacco Control Act. \nFinally, respondents complain (Br. in Opp. 21) that, \nunder the government\u2019s interpretation, \u201cpetitioners \nwould have to file separate lawsuits in different courts \nchallenging the same agency action.\u201d  But the Act allows \nparties to seek judicial review in the D.C. Circuit re-\ngardless of whether they reside or have their principal \nplaces of business there.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  If \n\n6 \n \nparties from different circuits wish to file a single peti-\ntion for review in a single circuit, they could always avail \nthemselves of that option.  In addition, separate peti-\ntions filed in different circuits could be consolidated in \na single circuit.  See 28 U.S.C. 2112.  \n3. As Judge Higginson\u2019s dissent explained, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision effectively nullifies the statute\u2019s limits \non venue.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Respondents argue (Br. \nin Opp. 17-18 & n.14) that a manufacturer can benefit \nfrom the decision below only if its products are sold out-\nside its home circuit\u2014and that the venue provision can \nstill do some work in cases where a manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts are sold in only one circuit or where no retailer \nwants to sell them anywhere.  In other words, respond-\nents suggest that Congress affirmatively enabled forum \nshopping by large manufacturers whose products are \nsold nationwide, though not by small manufacturers \nwhose products are sold only \u201cin one area.\u201d  Id. at 17.  \nBut if Congress meant to allow a manufacturer to sue \nwherever its products are sold, it would have said so.  \nCongress instead authorized a person to seek judicial \nreview only where it \u201cresides\u201d or has its \u201cprincipal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The decision below \nnegates that congressional choice.   \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review, \nAnd This Case Is A Suitable Vehicle For Resolving It \n1. Respondents do not dispute that the Fifth Circuit \nhas resolved the venue issue in a published opinion and \nnow regards that issue as settled.  See Pet. 15-16.  In-\ndeed, respondents have already filed amicus briefs in \nthe Fifth Circuit contending that the court has \u201cre-\njected FDA\u2019s venue arguments\u201d in a \u201cpublished opin-\n\n7 \n \nion\u201d and in \u201cunpublished orders\u201d; that the \u201cpublished \nholding on venue\u201d \u201cis binding\u201d; and that the \u201cprior rul-\nings control.\u201d  Reynolds et al. Amicus Br. at 2, 4, Shen-\nzhen Youme Information Tech. Co. v. FDA, No. 24-\n60060 (5th Cir. June 14, 2024) (Resp. Shenzhen Youme \nAmicus Br.); see Reynolds et al. Amicus Br. at 2, 4, \nShenzhen IVPS Tech. Co. v. FDA, No. 24-60032 (5th \nCir. May 24, 2024). \nAlthough respondents recently told the Fifth Circuit \nthat it has \u201crepeatedly resolved this issue against \nFDA,\u201d Resp. Shenzhen Youme Amicus Br. at 2, they \nnow claim that the venue issue arises only \u201crare[ly],\u201d \nBr. in Opp. 27 (capitalization omitted).  That is incor-\nrect.  In the petition for a writ of certiorari (at 16-17), \nwe cited six petitions for review\u2014including three from \nReynolds alone\u2014filed in the Fifth Circuit using the ma-\nneuver approved in the decision below.  That total has \nsince grown to nine.  In June 2024, NicQuid (an Ohio \nmanufacturer), Breeze Smoke (a Michigan manufac-\nturer), and Vertigo Vapor (a Washington manufacturer) \nall filed petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit joined \nby their Texas distributors.  See Pet. for Review at 1-2, \nNicQuid, LLC v. FDA, No. 24-60272 (5th Cir. June 3, \n2024); Pet. for Review at 1-2, Breeze Smoke, LLC v. \nFDA, No. 24-60304 (5th Cir. June 14, 2024); Pet. for Re-\nview at 1-2, Vertigo Vapor LLC v. FDA, No. 24-60332 \n(5th Cir. June 28, 2024).  That trend is likely to continue \nunless this Court intervenes.  \nRespondents seek to minimize the importance of that \ntrend by observing (Br. in Opp. 29) that FDA has denied \nmarketing authorization for \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of \nnew tobacco products.  But that figure is misleading:  A \nsingle manufacturer sometimes seeks authorization to \n\n8 \n \nmarket thousands of products.  See, e.g., FDA, News \nRelease, FDA Denies Marketing Applications for \nAbout 55,000 Flavored E-Cigarette Products for Fail-\ning to Provide Evidence They Appropriately Protect \nPublic Health 1 (Aug. 26, 2021) (describing decisions \nabout \u201c55,000 flavored [e-cigarette] products from three \napplicants\u201d).  And the entities that have taken ad-\nvantage of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision include some of \nthe Nation\u2019s largest manufacturers.  For instance, \nReynolds claims (Br. in Opp. 30) that its products are \n\u201cnot popular among youth,\u201d but the study it cites for \nthat proposition estimates that 420,000 middle- and \nhigh-school students used Reynolds\u2019 Vuse e-cigarette \nproducts in 2023, making Vuse the third most popular \ne-cigarette brand among youth.  See Jan Birdsey et al., \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health and Human Servs., Tobacco Product Use \nAmong U.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014 \nNational Youth Tobacco Survey, 2023, 72 Morbidity \nand Mortality Weekly Report 1180 (Nov. 3, 2023). \nRespondents insist (Br. in Opp. 28-29) that this \nCourt should nonetheless deny review because the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision does not create a circuit conflict.  As \nan initial matter, the decision conflicts with Amerada \nPetroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commission, 338 \nF.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), which held that a materially \nidentical venue provision did not permit out-of-circuit \ncompanies to seek review alongside an in-circuit com-\npany.  Respondents seek to distinguish Amerada Petro-\nleum as a case involving \u201c\u200a\u2018separate applications,\u2019\u200a\u201d ra-\nther than a \u201csingle order on one application,\u201d Br. in Opp. \n28 (brackets, citation, and emphases omitted), but the \nagency had consolidated the separate applications and \n\n9 \n \nissued a single order resolving them.  See 338 F.2d at \n809-810.  And respondents\u2019 theory\u2014that \u201c[n]othing in \nthe statutory language requires each petitioner to indi-\nvidually establish venue,\u201d Br. in Opp. 19\u2014does not dis-\ntinguish between an order denying separate applica-\ntions and one denying a single application.   \nEven putting aside Amerada Petroleum, this Court \nshould grant review.  Out-of-circuit manufacturers, in-\ncluding Reynolds, have repeatedly evaded adverse \nprecedent in the D.C. Circuit and their home circuits by \nenlisting retailers to join petitions for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  The Fifth Circuit, for its part, has repeat-\nedly approved that tactic.  Regardless of whether the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decisions create a circuit conflict, they \nundermine the venue provision and the authority of \nother circuits in a manner that warrants this Court\u2019s in-\ntervention. \nFinally, as respondents\u2019 and other manufacturers\u2019 \ndecisions to file petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit \ndemonstrate, manufacturers regard that circuit as a \nuniquely favorable forum in which to litigate against \nFDA.  Now that the Fifth Circuit has approved a tactic \nthat enables any out-of-circuit entity to file a petition \nfor review there, it is unlikely that any manufacturer \nwill feel the need to try the same tactic in other circuits, \nthat the venue issue will percolate in those circuits, or \nthat a circuit conflict will ever develop.  In such circum-\nstances, the absence of a circuit conflict should not dis-\nsuade the Court from granting review. \n2. Contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion (Br. in Opp. \n31-34), this case is a suitable vehicle for resolving the \nquestion presented.  To start, respondents simply err in \nsaying (id. at 5, 33) that FDA is asking this Court to \n\n10 \n \ngrant certiorari before judgment\u2014i.e., to review a dis-\ntrict court\u2019s decision before the court of appeals has \nacted.  Rather, FDA is asking the Court to review a \ncourt of appeals\u2019 interlocutory decision\u2014specifically, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss \nin Alto.  See Pet. 6.  Respondents claim (Br. in Opp. 31) \nthat this Court has never previously granted certiorari \n\u201cin this procedural posture,\u201d but the Court did just that \nin National Association of Manufacturers v. Depart-\nment of Defense, 583 U.S. 109 (2018), and has on many \nother occasions reviewed venue questions in an interloc-\nutory posture.  See Pet. 19-21.  \nRespondents also err in arguing (Br. in Opp. 5, 18, \n33) that FDA has forfeited its secondary contention that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.  \u201cOnce a federal \nclaim is properly presented, a party can make any argu-\nment in support of that claim; parties are not limited to \nthe precise arguments they made below.\u201d  Yee v. City of \nEscondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534 (1992).  Respondents do \nnot dispute that FDA preserved its venue claim in the \nFifth Circuit.   \nIn any event, this Court may consider an issue that \nwas \u201cpressed or passed upon below.\u201d  United States v. \nWilliams, 504 U.S. 36, 41 (1992) (emphasis added; cita-\ntion omitted).  Contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion (Br. \nin Opp. 33), the Fifth Circuit plainly passed upon the \nquestion whether venue must be proper as to each \nparty; it held in Alto that venue was proper because \n\u201ctwo of the [four] Petitioners  * * *  have their principal \nplaces of business in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d  Pet. App. 3a.  \nBy the time FDA moved to dismiss in Alto, moreover, \nthe Fifth Circuit had already held, in its published opin-\nion in Vibe, that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit\u201d so long \n\n11 \n \nas \u201ca petitioner\u201d is based there.  R.J. Reynolds, 65 F.4th \nat 188 (emphasis added).  It would have been futile for \nFDA to argue in Alto that venue must be proper as to \neach party.  \nRespondents further contend (Br. in Opp. 18) that \nFDA did not adequately argue in Vibe that venue must \nbe proper as to each party.  But because FDA is asking \nthis Court to review the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order in Alto, \nnot its order in Vibe, any purported forfeiture in Vibe is \nbeside the point.  And although FDA did not specifically \nargue that venue must be proper as to each party when \nit first raised venue in its emergency stay briefing in \nVibe, the Fifth Circuit reached out, resolved that un-\nbriefed issue, and held in a published opinion that \n\u201cvenue is proper in this circuit\u201d so long as \u201ca petitioner\u201d \nis based there.  Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 188 (emphasis \nadded).  Thus, in Vibe, as here, the question whether \nvenue must be proper as to each party was \u201cpassed upon \nbelow.\u201d  Williams, 504 U.S. at 41.  \nFinally, respondents err in contending (Br. in Opp. \n34) that Reynolds may continue litigating in the Fifth \nCircuit even if the retailers are dismissed from the case.  \nThe cases cited by respondents state only that \u201cvenue \nis determined at the outset of the litigation\u201d and that a \ncase that was \u201cproperly venued\u201d \u201cis not affected by a \nsubsequent change in parties.\u201d  Exxon Corp. v. FTC, \n588 F.2d 895, 898-899 (3d Cir. 1978).  But this case was \nnot \u201cproperly venued\u201d \u201cat the outset of the litigation,\u201d \nibid.; rather, for the reasons discussed above, venue has \nbeen improper from the beginning.  At any rate, be-\ncause the Fifth Circuit did not rely on that alternative \nrationale, this Court would not need to address it if it \ngrants the petition for a writ of certiorari.   \n\n12 \n \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has significantly evolved with the introduction of the Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds, et al.) Brief in Opposition. I now have a balanced view of the legal arguments the Supreme Court will consider, moving from a one-sided perspective based on the FDA's petition to a more complete picture of the dispute.\n\nMy prior beliefs, centered on the FDA's arguments, remain a core part of my understanding of the Petitioner's strategy. These include the FDA's focus on improper venue and forum shopping, their \"zone of interests\" argument that limits standing to the manufacturer-applicant, their strict interpretation of venue requiring each petitioner to qualify independently, and their reliance on precedents like *Block v. Community Nutrition Institute* and *Smith v. Lyon*.\n\nThe observation of the Respondents' brief has added the following crucial dimensions to my beliefs:\n\n*   **Respondents' Counter-Arguments & Strategy:** I now understand the Respondents' multi-faceted defense, which combines textualism, a broader view of the statutory scheme, and strong procedural objections.\n    1.  **Plain Text Interpretation (\"any person adversely affected\"):** The Respondents' lead argument is a direct textualist one. They contend that the phrase \"any person adversely affected\" in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is unambiguous. A retailer who is legally prohibited from selling a product, faces substantial revenue loss, and may even go out of business (as is claimed for Avail Vapor) is definitionally \"adversely affected.\" This simple, common-sense reading directly counters the FDA's more complex, purpose-driven interpretation.\n    2.  **Broader \"Zone of Interests\":** The Respondents forcefully argue that retailers are well within the TCA's \"zone of interests.\" They point out that numerous provisions of the TCA and the broader FDCA directly regulate retailers, imposing obligations and penalties related to sales, distribution, and marketing. This refutes the FDA's narrative that the statutory scheme is concerned only with manufacturers. They cite modern, permissive standing cases like ***Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami*** and the very recent ***Truck Ins. Exch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co.*** (2024) to argue the \"zone of interests\" test is not demanding and is easily met by parties regulated under a statute.\n    3.  **Modern Venue & Joinder Principles:** In response to the FDA's argument that each petitioner must independently establish venue, the Respondents argue that once venue is proper for a single petitioner (the retailer), other proper parties (the manufacturer) may join the action. They argue this promotes judicial efficiency by avoiding duplicative litigation over the same agency order in different circuits. They distinguish the FDA's 19th-century precedents (*Smith v. Lyon*) by noting they predate modern, more liberal venue and joinder rules, such as those in the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011.\n    4.  **Significant Procedural Objections to Certiorari:** A major component of the Respondents' strategy is to argue that the Court should not hear the case at all. These \"vehicular\" arguments are critical to my prediction:\n        *   **No Circuit Split:** They assert (and note the FDA concedes) that there is no disagreement among the circuit courts on this question, a primary reason the Supreme Court typically denies review.\n        *   **Improper Interlocutory Appeal:** They characterize the FDA's petition as an extraordinary request for interlocutory review of a non-final procedural order (a denial of a motion to transfer), arguing the FDA has not met the high bar for such a review.\n        *   **Forfeiture:** They claim the FDA failed to raise its second question (that all petitioners must individually satisfy venue) in the court below, thereby forfeiting the argument.\n\n*   **Key Precedents in Conflict:** My belief state now includes a direct \"head-to-head\" map of the key cases:\n    *   **On Standing/Zone of Interests:** FDA relies on older, more restrictive cases like *Block*. Respondents counter with modern, permissive cases like *Patchak*, *City of Miami*, and *Kaiser Gypsum*.\n    *   **On Venue/Joinder:** FDA relies on 19th-century cases like *Smith v. Lyon*. Respondents counter with modern venue principles and cases like *Sidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin.*, arguing the older cases are obsolete.\n\n*   **Key Information Needed (Refined):** While the primary arguments are now clear, my predictive model would be further improved by observing any amicus briefs filed in support of either side. Amicus briefs from industry groups, public health organizations, or administrative law scholars could signal the broader implications of the case and which arguments are resonating with key stakeholders, potentially influencing the Justices' decision to grant certiorari and their view of the merits. The FDA's reply brief will also be critical to see how they respond to the Respondents' powerful textual and procedural arguments.",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the Petitioner's (FDA's) Reply Brief has substantially refined my understanding of the legal landscape and significantly increased my belief that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari. While my previous belief state captured the balanced \"head-to-head\" nature of the arguments, the Solicitor General's reply provides powerful counter-arguments to the Respondents' strongest points and reframes the stakes of the case. My beliefs are now updated as follows:\n\nMy prior understanding of the core arguments from both the FDA's petition and the Respondents' brief in opposition remains intact. The FDA still relies on a narrow \"zone of interests\" and the traditional rule that each petitioner must satisfy venue. The Respondents still champion a plain-text reading of \"any person adversely affected\" and modern, liberal joinder principles. The Reply Brief builds directly on this foundation by systematically attempting to dismantle the Respondents' defenses.\n\nThe new, crucial dimensions added to my beliefs by the FDA's Reply Brief are:\n\n*   **Direct Rebuttal of Respondents' Core Arguments:** I now have a clear view of the FDA's counter-attack strategy.\n    1.  **\"Adversely Affected\" as a Legal Term of Art:** The FDA directly counters RJR's plain-text argument by asserting that \"adversely affected\" is a legal term of art, not a phrase to be interpreted by its common dictionary meaning. They cite *Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding* and Scalia & Garner's *Reading Law* to argue its meaning is derived from the specific statutory context. This shifts the debate from a simple textualist reading to a more complex analysis of statutory structure.\n    2.  **Focus on Statutory Structure:** The FDA heavily emphasizes a structural argument: since the TCA denies retailers notice of a denial order and access to the confidential marketing application, Congress could not have intended for them to have standing to challenge that order. They highlight the seeming inconsistency that retailers cannot challenge a *withdrawal* of authorization (a more direct harm) but supposedly can challenge a *denial*. This argument frames the retailers' interest as \"entirely derivative\" and adequately protected by the manufacturer.\n    3.  **Neutralizing Respondents' Precedents:** The FDA attempts to wall off RJR's key permissive standing cases. They argue *Patchak* is inapplicable because it concerned the APA's general standing provision, not a specific statute, and *Bank of America* is distinguishable because the Fair Housing Act contains an exceptionally broad definition of \"aggrieved person\" not present in the TCA.\n    4.  **Reinforcing Traditional Venue Rules:** The FDA defends its reliance on 19th-century cases like *Smith v. Lyon* by arguing it represents a default rule. They attack RJR's counter-examples by claiming the decisions on other venue statutes (like 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C)) were based on specific legislative history absent here, or (like in *Global Van Lines*) provided no analysis at all.\n\n*   **Strengthened Case for Certiorari (Countering Vehicular Objections):** The Reply Brief makes a much more forceful and compelling case for why the Court must intervene now.\n    1.  **Framing the Urgency:** The FDA refutes the idea that this is a \"rare\" issue. They document that the number of cases using this venue maneuver in the Fifth Circuit has grown from six to nine, involving major national manufacturers. They argue that the Fifth Circuit has become a \"magnet\" jurisdiction, which itself prevents a circuit split from developing because manufacturers have no incentive to try the tactic elsewhere. This is a powerful institutional argument for Supreme Court intervention.\n    2.  **Public Health Stakes:** The FDA injects a strong public health narrative by citing a CDC study that identifies Vuse (RJR's product) as the third most popular e-cigarette brand among youth. This elevates the case from a dry procedural dispute to one with urgent, real-world consequences.\n    3.  **Defeating Forfeiture/Procedural Claims:** The Solicitor General provides robust answers to RJR's procedural blocks. They cite *Yee v. City of Escondido* to argue that once the *claim* of improper venue was raised, they are free to make any *argument* in support of it. They also argue the issue was \"passed upon\" by the lower court (per *United States v. Williams*) because its ruling implicitly rejected the \"all petitioners\" standard. Finally, they cite *National Ass'n of Manufacturers v. Dept. of Defense* as direct precedent for the Court granting certiorari to review an interlocutory venue decision from a court of appeals.\n\n*   **Key Precedents (Updated):** My map of conflicting precedents is now more detailed.\n    *   **On Standing/Zone of Interests:** The FDA adds *Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding* to its arsenal to argue \"adversely affected\" is a term of art, directly countering RJR's textualism.\n    *   **On Venue/Joinder:** The FDA now argues that *Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commission* from the Tenth Circuit creates a direct circuit conflict.\n    *   **On Procedural Posture:** The FDA's citation to *National Ass'n of Manufacturers v. Dept. of Defense* is a critical new data point, establishing that the Court has recently taken up a case in this exact interlocutory posture to resolve a venue question.\n\nIn sum, the Reply Brief has significantly shifted my belief state. While the underlying legal questions remain contested, the FDA has successfully bolstered its own arguments and, more importantly, has constructed a compelling narrative of urgency, forum shopping, and public health risk that makes a grant of certiorari much more likely. They have provided plausible, well-supported answers to each of the procedural \"off-ramps\" that RJR tried to provide the Court.",

With the \nbenefit of guidance from the distinguished legal \nscholars, corporate legal officers, private practitioners, \nbusiness executives, and prominent scientists who \nserve on its Board of Directors and Advisory Council, \nALF pursues its mission by participating as amicus \ncuriae in carefully selected appeals before the \nSupreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and state \nsupreme courts.  See atlanticlegal.org. \n* * * \n  \nThis \nappeal \nconcerns \nthe \nability \nof \nthe \nmanufacturer and retailers of a federally regulated \nproduct to jointly challenge, in a single federal court of \nappeals, a final agency action that directly and \nindisputably \nimpairs \ntheir \nshared \ncommercial \ninterests.  Petitioner Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or part, and \nno party or counsel other than the amicus curiae and its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n \n \n\n2 \n \n \npersistent efforts to block the Fifth Circuit from \nreviewing the regulatory action at issue\u2014denial of \n\u201cpremarket\u201d \nauthorization \nthat \nwould \nallow \nRespondents \nto \ncontinue \nselling \nVuse \n\u201cAlto\u201d   \ne-cigarettes\u2014trigger ALF\u2019s missions of advocating for \ncivil justice, responsible government, and free \nenterprise.  \n \nALF \ntakes \nno \nposition \non \nthe \nmerits \nof \nRespondents\u2019 challenge to FDA\u2019s denial of marketing \nauthorization for Vuse Alto e-cigarettes.  Instead, this \namicus brief focuses on the question of whether a Vuse \ne-cigarette retailer has statutory standing to obtain \njudicial review of FDA\u2019s denial.  At least one retailer, \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C., has been \nselling Vuse e-cigarettes since before FDA decided to \ndeny authorization to market them as \u201cnew tobacco \nproducts\u201d under the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387 et seq.2 \nAvail has stated that it \u201cwould \u2018cease business \noperations\u2019 if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into effect.\u201d  \nApp. 5a.3 \n \n2 The TCA was enacted in 2009 as subchapter IX of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.  In 2016 \nFDA deemed e-cigarettes to be \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d subject to \nthe TCA.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j; 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, \n2016).     \n3 The Fifth Circuit has stayed FDA\u2019s marketing denial pending \ndisposition of this appeal.  See Brief for the Petitioners (\u201cFDA \nBr.\u201d) at 7.    \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn its Order denying FDA\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or \nTransfer, the Fifth Circuit held\u2014not surprisingly\u2014 \nthat the TCA \u201cgrants the Petitioners [Respondents \nhere] statutory standing to challenge FDA decisions \nthat affect them.\u201d  App. 4a.  \u201cAll the Petitioners have \nstatutory standing as \u2018person[s] adversely affected\u2019 \nunder the [TCA].\u201d  Id. 5a (quoting 21 U.S.C.    \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1)).       \n \nThis Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order.  \nIndeed, ALF believes that the question of statutory \nstanding \npresented \nin \nthis \ncase \ntranscends   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), the TCA judicial review provision at issue.  \nHaving granted certiorari, the Court now has an \nimportant opportunity to reaffirm, or at least clarify, \nthe breadth of a statute-specific right to judicial \nreview that encompasses \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a final agency action.4    \n \n4 ALF defers to Respondents as to why the Court also should \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the equally important \nquestion of whether venue under \u00a7 387l(a)(1) must be satisfied \nindependently by each joint petitioner for judicial review of an \nFDA tobacco product marketing denial.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes and two of the same Respondents as \nhere\u2014R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) and Mississippi \nPetroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association\u2014the \nFifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit.\u201d    \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA (\u201cRJRV\u201d), 65 F.4th 182, 188   \n(5th Cir. 2023); see also App. 4a (\u201cStare decisis governs venue   \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThis Court, like the Fifth Circuit, should reject \nFDA\u2019s narrow and self-serving interpretation of the \nTCA judicial review provision at issue, 21 U.S.C.        \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1).  That plainly and broadly worded \nprovision entitles \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by \nan FDA \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d (e.g., e-cigarette) \nmarketing authorization denial to file a petition for \njudicial review (emphasis added).  But FDA argues \nthat  \u00a7 387l(a)(1) applies only to manufacturers.  \nPlacing form over substance, FDA contends that   \ne-cigarette retailers are excluded because despite the \neconomic consequences they suffer where, as here, the \nagency denies an e-cigarette marketing authorization, \nit is the manufacturer that submits the application for \nmarketing approval and that is the addressee on \nFDA\u2019s denial order.    \n \nhere so long as the distributors have standing, which they do.\u201d). \n     FDA\u2019s elaborate but strained arguments that Respondent \nretailers lack statutory standing are part of its attempt to keep \nthis appeal (and related Vuse e-cigarette appeals) out of the   \nFifth Circuit.  The agency\u2019s effort to compel RJRV to pursue its \nchallenge to FDA\u2019s Vuse e-cigarette marketing denials in either \nthe D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit\u2014which FDA claims \nalready have rejected the principal legal theory on which RJRV\u2019s \nchallenge relies\u2014is no less a type of \u201cforum shopping\u201d than what \nFDA accuses the Fifth Circuit of condoning.  See FDA Br. at 4-5; \nsee also App. 5a.        \n\n5 \n \n \n \nFDA\u2019s convoluted arguments about statutory \nstanding defy common sense, as well as the text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), which refers to judicial review of a \n\u201cdenial,\u201d not of a denial \u201corder.\u201d  The Court should \nview the zone of interests for determining who is \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by a marketing denial, and thus \nhas the right to judicial review, as leniently for  \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) as it does for the Administrative \nProcedure Act\u2019s almost identically worded judicial \nreview provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that the benefit of any doubt \nshould go to the plaintiff, here the Respondents,  \nincluding the retailers.  \n \nThere are many additional federal statutes \ncontaining judicial review provisions that expressly \napply to any person adversely affected by a final \nagency action.  If this Court were to adopt FDA\u2019s \nnarrow, superficial, and inflexible approach for \nidentifying the zone of interests for statutory standing \npurposes, a great variety of businesses subject to other \nfederal statutes may be deprived of the opportunity to \nchallenge agency actions that are detrimental to their \neconomic, \nreputational, \nand/or \nother \ninterests.  \nInstead, the Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Respondent retailers, as well as \nRespondent RJRV, have statutory standing to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s e-cigarette marketing denial.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nRespondent E-Cigarette Retailers   \nHave Statutory Standing \n \nA. The judicial review provision should be \nconstrued broadly   \n \nSection \u00a7 387l(a)(1) states in part that \u201cany person \nadversely affected by . . . denial [of a \u201cnew tobacco \nproduct\u201d marketing application] may file a petition for \njudicial review of such . . . denial.\u201d  FDA argues that \nthis broadly worded judicial review provision is \nlimited to manufacturers.  The agency\u2019s contrived \ncontention that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) excludes e-cigarette \nretailers is wrong.  It is an advocacy position \ncalculated to prevent the Fifth Circuit\u2014where venue \nunquestionably \nis \nproper \nfor \nthe \nRespondent \nretailers\u2014from addressing the merits of FDA\u2019s Vuse \ne-cigarette marketing denials.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes, the Fifth Circuit not only \nhas held that venue is proper, see supra n. 4, but also \nthat success on the merits is likely.  See RJRV, 65 \nF.4th at 188, 189-94.     \n \n1.  According to FDA, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \u201cshows no . . . \nsolicitude for retailers.\u201d  FDA Br. at 7.  FDA argues \nthat the marketing denial \u201corder that FDA issues . . . \nspeaks to the applicant alone (always or nearly always \na manufacturer of the product) and affects retailers \nonly indirectly.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  The term \n\u201corder,\u201d however, does not appear in  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \nwhich instead twice refers more broadly to judicial \nreview of a \u201cdenial.\u201d  Other subsections of  \u00a7 387l do \n\n7 \n \n \nrefer to a denial \u201corder.\u201d  See, e.g., \u00a7 387l(a)(2)(B) \n(Record of proceedings);  387l(b) (Standard of review).  \nBut unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1), these and other subsections \nthat facilitate judicial review of marketing denial \norders do not specify who is entitled to file a petition \nfor review of such an order.   \n \nIf Congress had wanted to limit the right to judicial \nreview of denials to applicants for marketing \nauthorization, it would have said so in \u00a7 387l(a)(1), as \nit did in connection with FDA withdrawals of \nmarketing authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) \n(referring to \u201c[t]he holder of an application subject to \n[a withdrawal] order\u201d).  Instead, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) expressly \nauthorizes a petition for judicial review of a marketing \ndenial to be filed by \u201cany person adversely affected by \nsuch . . .  denial\u201d (emphasis added).  This is \u201can \nauthorization of remarkable breadth.\u201d  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  As the Fifth Circuit \nobserved in its Order here, \u201c\u2018[w]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019\u201d  \nApp. 4a (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. \n16, 23 (1983)).    \n \n2.  Turning a blind eye to the plain text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), FDA invokes the \u201czone of interests\u201d test \nfor statutory standing to sue.  FDA Br. at 12. In so \ndoing, FDA glosses over the broad, unambiguous \nlanguage of   \u00a7 387l(a)(1)\u2014language that is virtually \nidentical to the omnibus Administrative Procedure \n\n8 \n \n \nAct (APA) judicial review provision, which states that \n\u201c[a] person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action. . . is entitled to judicial review.\u201d   \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court repeatedly has explained \nthat in the APA context the zone of interests test \u201cis \nnot especially demanding . . . the benefit of any doubt \ngoes to the plaintiff.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).  Given the close \nsimilarity in statutory language, the same \u201clenient \napproach\u201d that this Court affords to the APA\u2019s judicial \nreview provision, Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, should \napply to the right to judicial review under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1).   \n \nB. FDA\u2019s marketing denial adversely affects \nRespondent retailers \n \n1.  Unable to avoid the fact that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \nexpressly refers to \u201cany person\u201d\u2014not merely to an \napplicant for marketing authorization\u2014FDA argues \nthat the zone of interests test governs the meaning of \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d in \u00a7 387l(a)(1) and precludes \nretailers from \u201cchalleng[ing] an order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s \napplication \nfor \nmarketing \nauthorization.\u201d  FDA Br. at 13.  Under the zone of \ninterests test, courts \u201cpresume that a statutory cause \nof action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law \ninvoked.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990) (\u201c[T]o be \n\n9 \n \n \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the \nmeaning\u2019 of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the \nadverse effect upon him) falls within the \u2018zone of \ninterests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statutory \nprovision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \ncomplaint.\u201d). \n \nBecause the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue . . . what \ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative \naction under the generous review provisions of the \nAPA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FDA \nis mistaken this potential distinction between the APA \nand a statute-specific judicial review provision means \nthat the lenient approach afforded to the zone of \ninterests test in APA judicial review cases \u201cdoes not   \n. . . carry over to other statutes.\u201d  FDA Br. at 12.  \nNonetheless, seizing upon what it erroneously asserts \nis a categorical difference between APA and non-APA \ncases, FDA argues that for purposes of seeking judicial \nreview of a marketing denial under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \u201c[a] \nretailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 13. \n \n2.  FDA points to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c) as the TCA \nprovision whose zone of interests supposedly governs \nthe right of any adversely affected person to obtain \njudicial review of marketing denials.  That section, \ntitled \u201cAction on application,\u201d establishes procedures \n\n10 \n \n \nand standards for FDA\u2019s review of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for a \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d marketing \nauthorization, including for e-cigarettes.  See RJRV, \n65 F.4th at 187-88 (summarizing TCA statutory and \nregulatory background); Wages & White Lion Invests., \nLLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2024)  \n(en banc) (same).  \n  \nAccording to FDA, \u00a7 387j(c) \u201cprotects  . . . only the \ninterests of the applicant itself,\u201d not \u201cthe interests of \nretail sellers of the applicant\u2019s products.\u201d  FDA Br. at \n14.  Elevating form over substance, FDA asserts that \nbecause a marketing approval or denial order under   \n\u00a7 387j(c) is \u201cissued to the applicant alone,\u201d id., retail \nsellers of the product are not encompassed by    \n\u00a7 387j(c)\u2019s zone of interests. \n \nEven assuming that the right to judicial review \nunder \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is limited to the zone of interests \ncircumscribed by \u00a7 387j(c), Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests squarely fit within that zone.  This is not a \ncase where \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Lexmark, 572 \nU.S. at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nFDA simply is wrong that because a marketing \ndenial order is facially directed to the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer), it \u201cregulates only the applicant.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 14.  FDA\u2019s October 12, 2023 marketing denial \nletter (i.e., order), App. 9a, declares that the Vuse   \ne-cigarette products at issue are both \u201cmisbranded\u201d \n\n11 \n \n \nand \u201cadulterated,\u201d and are prohibited from being \n\u201cintroduce[d] or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate \ncommerce.\u201d \n \nId. \n10a, \n14a. \n \nFDA \nacknowledges \nthat \n\u201c[i]f \na \nmanufacturer \nlacks \nauthorization to sell a product, retailers cannot \nlawfully obtain and resell it.\u201d  FDA Br. at 14; see        \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (prohibiting \u201c[t]he introduction or \ndelivery for introduction into interstate commerce of \nany . . . tobacco product . . . that is adulterated or \nmisbranded\u201d).  What FDA refers to as an \u201cindirect \neffect\u201d of a marketing denial order, FDA Br. at 14, can \nhave \ndirect \nand \nserious \nconsequences \nfor \nnoncompliant retailers.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 \n(Penalties); id. \u00a7 333(a)(1) (criminal penalties for \n\u201c[a]ny person who violates a provision of section 331\u201d) \n(emphasis added); id. \u00a7 333(f)(9) (civil monetary \npenalties for violation of tobacco product requirements \nby \u201c[a]ny person\u201d) (emphasis added); see also 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E) (seizure of \u201c[a]ny adulterated or \nmisbranded tobacco product\u201d).   \n \nFDA\u2019s brief alleges that Respondent retailers \nengaged in \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by selling e-cigarettes \nboth \nbefore \nand \nafter \ndenial \nof \nmarketing \nauthorization.  FDA Br. at 8.  This assertion not only \nis unfounded, but also disingenuous in light of FDA\u2019s \npublicly announced compliance/enforcement policy \nallowing certain preexisting e-cigarettes to remain on \nthe market pending submission and review of \nmarketing authorization applications.  See 81 Fed. \nReg. at 28,977.  Nonetheless, FDA\u2019s insinuation that \nRespondent retailers may be in legal jeopardy in light \n\n12 \n \n \nof the marketing denial order underscores why they \nare adversely affected by the denial. \n \n3.  As the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying FDA\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss or Transfer reflects, the agency\u2019s \narguments \nthat \nRespondent \nretailers \nare \nnot \nadversely affected by the marketing authorization \ndenial for purposes of seeking judicial review under   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) are \u201cunavailing.\u201d  App. 4a.  Indeed, FDA\u2019s \ncontention that Respondent retailers lack statutory \nstanding defies common sense, especially in view of \nthe undisputed evidence that Respondent Avail Vapor \nTexas would go out of business if the denial order goes \ninto effect.  Id.   \n \nThe Court held in Lexmark, a frequently cited case \non statutory standing, that \u201calleg[ing] an injury to a \ncommercial interest in reputation or sales\u201d was \nenough to satisfy the zone of interests for the false \nadvertising statute involved in that case.  572 U.S. at \n132; cf.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin a case to satisfy Article III standing requirements).  \nGiven the injury to their commercial interests, i.e., \nsales, and possibly reputational harm, that they will \nsuffer if FDA\u2019s marketing denial goes into effect, \nRespondent retailers have enough of a personal stake \n\n13 \n \n \nin this case, i.e., statutory as well as Article III \nstanding, to challenge FDA\u2019s denial order.5   \n \n4.  The Court should take a broader view of the \napplicable zone of interests than the \u00a7 387j(c) \nmarketing denial procedures on which FDA predicates \nit superficial statutory standing arguments.  Section \n387j(c) also contains a statutory standard for granting \nor denying new tobacco product, including e-cigarette, \nmarketing applications: \u201cprotection of the public \nhealth.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 387j(c)(2)(A), 387j(c)(4), \n387j(c)(5)(A).   \n \nAs indicated above, FDA determined that retail \nsales of certain preexisting e-cigarette products could \ncontinue pending submission and review of marketing \nauthorization applications.  FDA\u2019s stated rationale for \nthis carefully considered compliance/enforcement \n \n5 In Lexmark the Court criticized use of the term \u201cprudential \nstanding\u201d as \u201cmisleading\u201d  because \u201cdeclin[ing] to adjudicate [a] \nclaim \non \ngrounds \nthat \nare \n\u2018prudential,\u2019 \nrather \nthan \nconstitutional\u201d where a plaintiff has Article III standing (as \nRespondents do here) \u201cis in some tension with [the Court\u2019s] \nreaffirmation of the principle that a federal court\u2019s obligation to \nhear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually \nunflagging.\u201d  572 U.S. at 125-26; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. \nCity of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017) (\u201cIn Lexmark we said \nthat the label \u2018prudential standing\u2019 was misleading, for the \nrequirement at issue is in reality is tied to a particular statute.  \nThe question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause \nof action that he asserts.\u201d). Thus, referring to \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d in connection with a statute\u2019s zone of interests is more \napt.  Id. at 1302-03.         \n\n14 \n \n \npolicy was in part protection of public health\u2014\nspecifically, continuing to make certain e-cigarette \nproducts available to adults who want \u201cto transition \naway from combusted tobacco use.\u201d  81 Fed. Reg. at \n28,977. Retailers\u2019 commercial interests in continuing \nto make such e-cigarette products available to \ncombusted-tobacco transitioning adults align with the \npublic health-related interests identified by FDA and \nexpressly incorporated into \u00a7 387j(c).  In other words, \nby making e-cigarettes available to the adult public, \nRespondent retailers facilitate the public health \ninterests that FDA has identified.  FDA\u2019s public health \nrationale is another reason why Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests are adversely affected by FDA\u2019s marketing \nauthorization denial, and thus, why the retailers have \nstatutory standing to seek judicial review.  Cf. Env\u2019t \nDef. Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. \n1970) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected \nby the [pesticide registration] statute includes not \nonly the economic interest of the registrant but also \nthe interest of the public in safety.\u201d). \n \n5.  In short, this Court, like the court of appeals, \nshould follow a common-sense approach and affirm \nthat the Respondent retailers have statutory standing \nto challenge FDA\u2019s marketing denial.  \nC. This Court\u2019s ruling may affect the \navailability of judicial review under \nnumerous other statutes  \n \nAccording to a recent survey conducted for the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States, there \n\n15 \n \n \nare \u201cover 650 specific judicial review provisions in the \nUnited States Code.\u201d  Jonathan R.

ALF\u2019s mission is to advance the rule \nof law and civil justice by advocating for individual \nliberty, free enterprise, property rights, limited and \nresponsible government, sound science in judicial and \nregulatory proceedings, and effective education, \nincluding parental rights and school choice.  With the \nbenefit of guidance from the distinguished legal \nscholars, corporate legal officers, private practitioners, \nbusiness executives, and prominent scientists who \nserve on its Board of Directors and Advisory Council, \nALF pursues its mission by participating as amicus \ncuriae in carefully selected appeals before the \nSupreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and state \nsupreme courts.  See atlanticlegal.org. \n* * * \n  \nThis \nappeal \nconcerns \nthe \nability \nof \nthe \nmanufacturer and retailers of a federally regulated \nproduct to jointly challenge, in a single federal court of \nappeals, a final agency action that directly and \nindisputably \nimpairs \ntheir \nshared \ncommercial \ninterests.  Petitioner Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or part, and \nno party or counsel other than the amicus curiae and its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n \n \n\n2 \n \n \npersistent efforts to block the Fifth Circuit from \nreviewing the regulatory action at issue\u2014denial of \n\u201cpremarket\u201d \nauthorization \nthat \nwould \nallow \nRespondents \nto \ncontinue \nselling \nVuse \n\u201cAlto\u201d   \ne-cigarettes\u2014trigger ALF\u2019s missions of advocating for \ncivil justice, responsible government, and free \nenterprise.  \n \nALF \ntakes \nno \nposition \non \nthe \nmerits \nof \nRespondents\u2019 challenge to FDA\u2019s denial of marketing \nauthorization for Vuse Alto e-cigarettes.  Instead, this \namicus brief focuses on the question of whether a Vuse \ne-cigarette retailer has statutory standing to obtain \njudicial review of FDA\u2019s denial.  At least one retailer, \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C., has been \nselling Vuse e-cigarettes since before FDA decided to \ndeny authorization to market them as \u201cnew tobacco \nproducts\u201d under the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387 et seq.2 \nAvail has stated that it \u201cwould \u2018cease business \noperations\u2019 if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into effect.\u201d  \nApp. 5a.3 \n \n2 The TCA was enacted in 2009 as subchapter IX of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.  In 2016 \nFDA deemed e-cigarettes to be \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d subject to \nthe TCA.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j; 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, \n2016).     \n3 The Fifth Circuit has stayed FDA\u2019s marketing denial pending \ndisposition of this appeal.  See Brief for the Petitioners (\u201cFDA \nBr.\u201d) at 7.    \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn its Order denying FDA\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or \nTransfer, the Fifth Circuit held\u2014not surprisingly\u2014 \nthat the TCA \u201cgrants the Petitioners [Respondents \nhere] statutory standing to challenge FDA decisions \nthat affect them.\u201d  App. 4a.  \u201cAll the Petitioners have \nstatutory standing as \u2018person[s] adversely affected\u2019 \nunder the [TCA].\u201d  Id. 5a (quoting 21 U.S.C.    \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1)).       \n \nThis Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order.  \nIndeed, ALF believes that the question of statutory \nstanding \npresented \nin \nthis \ncase \ntranscends   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), the TCA judicial review provision at issue.  \nHaving granted certiorari, the Court now has an \nimportant opportunity to reaffirm, or at least clarify, \nthe breadth of a statute-specific right to judicial \nreview that encompasses \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a final agency action.4    \n \n4 ALF defers to Respondents as to why the Court also should \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the equally important \nquestion of whether venue under \u00a7 387l(a)(1) must be satisfied \nindependently by each joint petitioner for judicial review of an \nFDA tobacco product marketing denial.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes and two of the same Respondents as \nhere\u2014R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) and Mississippi \nPetroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association\u2014the \nFifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit.\u201d    \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA (\u201cRJRV\u201d), 65 F.4th 182, 188   \n(5th Cir. 2023); see also App. 4a (\u201cStare decisis governs venue   \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThis Court, like the Fifth Circuit, should reject \nFDA\u2019s narrow and self-serving interpretation of the \nTCA judicial review provision at issue, 21 U.S.C.        \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1).  That plainly and broadly worded \nprovision entitles \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by \nan FDA \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d (e.g., e-cigarette) \nmarketing authorization denial to file a petition for \njudicial review (emphasis added).  But FDA argues \nthat  \u00a7 387l(a)(1) applies only to manufacturers.  \nPlacing form over substance, FDA contends that   \ne-cigarette retailers are excluded because despite the \neconomic consequences they suffer where, as here, the \nagency denies an e-cigarette marketing authorization, \nit is the manufacturer that submits the application for \nmarketing approval and that is the addressee on \nFDA\u2019s denial order.    \n \nhere so long as the distributors have standing, which they do.\u201d). \n     FDA\u2019s elaborate but strained arguments that Respondent \nretailers lack statutory standing are part of its attempt to keep \nthis appeal (and related Vuse e-cigarette appeals) out of the   \nFifth Circuit.  The agency\u2019s effort to compel RJRV to pursue its \nchallenge to FDA\u2019s Vuse e-cigarette marketing denials in either \nthe D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit\u2014which FDA claims \nalready have rejected the principal legal theory on which RJRV\u2019s \nchallenge relies\u2014is no less a type of \u201cforum shopping\u201d than what \nFDA accuses the Fifth Circuit of condoning.  See FDA Br. at 4-5; \nsee also App. 5a.        \n\n5 \n \n \n \nFDA\u2019s convoluted arguments about statutory \nstanding defy common sense, as well as the text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), which refers to judicial review of a \n\u201cdenial,\u201d not of a denial \u201corder.\u201d  The Court should \nview the zone of interests for determining who is \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by a marketing denial, and thus \nhas the right to judicial review, as leniently for  \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) as it does for the Administrative \nProcedure Act\u2019s almost identically worded judicial \nreview provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that the benefit of any doubt \nshould go to the plaintiff, here the Respondents,  \nincluding the retailers.  \n \nThere are many additional federal statutes \ncontaining judicial review provisions that expressly \napply to any person adversely affected by a final \nagency action.  If this Court were to adopt FDA\u2019s \nnarrow, superficial, and inflexible approach for \nidentifying the zone of interests for statutory standing \npurposes, a great variety of businesses subject to other \nfederal statutes may be deprived of the opportunity to \nchallenge agency actions that are detrimental to their \neconomic, \nreputational, \nand/or \nother \ninterests.  \nInstead, the Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Respondent retailers, as well as \nRespondent RJRV, have statutory standing to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s e-cigarette marketing denial.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nRespondent E-Cigarette Retailers   \nHave Statutory Standing \n \nA. The judicial review provision should be \nconstrued broadly   \n \nSection \u00a7 387l(a)(1) states in part that \u201cany person \nadversely affected by . . . denial [of a \u201cnew tobacco \nproduct\u201d marketing application] may file a petition for \njudicial review of such . . . denial.\u201d  FDA argues that \nthis broadly worded judicial review provision is \nlimited to manufacturers.  The agency\u2019s contrived \ncontention that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) excludes e-cigarette \nretailers is wrong.  It is an advocacy position \ncalculated to prevent the Fifth Circuit\u2014where venue \nunquestionably \nis \nproper \nfor \nthe \nRespondent \nretailers\u2014from addressing the merits of FDA\u2019s Vuse \ne-cigarette marketing denials.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes, the Fifth Circuit not only \nhas held that venue is proper, see supra n. 4, but also \nthat success on the merits is likely.  See RJRV, 65 \nF.4th at 188, 189-94.     \n \n1.  According to FDA, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \u201cshows no . . . \nsolicitude for retailers.\u201d  FDA Br. at 7.  FDA argues \nthat the marketing denial \u201corder that FDA issues . . . \nspeaks to the applicant alone (always or nearly always \na manufacturer of the product) and affects retailers \nonly indirectly.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  The term \n\u201corder,\u201d however, does not appear in  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \nwhich instead twice refers more broadly to judicial \nreview of a \u201cdenial.\u201d  Other subsections of  \u00a7 387l do \n\n7 \n \n \nrefer to a denial \u201corder.\u201d  See, e.g., \u00a7 387l(a)(2)(B) \n(Record of proceedings);  387l(b) (Standard of review).  \nBut unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1), these and other subsections \nthat facilitate judicial review of marketing denial \norders do not specify who is entitled to file a petition \nfor review of such an order.   \n \nIf Congress had wanted to limit the right to judicial \nreview of denials to applicants for marketing \nauthorization, it would have said so in \u00a7 387l(a)(1), as \nit did in connection with FDA withdrawals of \nmarketing authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) \n(referring to \u201c[t]he holder of an application subject to \n[a withdrawal] order\u201d).  Instead, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) expressly \nauthorizes a petition for judicial review of a marketing \ndenial to be filed by \u201cany person adversely affected by \nsuch . . .  denial\u201d (emphasis added).  This is \u201can \nauthorization of remarkable breadth.\u201d  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  As the Fifth Circuit \nobserved in its Order here, \u201c\u2018[w]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019\u201d  \nApp. 4a (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. \n16, 23 (1983)).    \n \n2.  Turning a blind eye to the plain text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), FDA invokes the \u201czone of interests\u201d test \nfor statutory standing to sue.  FDA Br. at 12. In so \ndoing, FDA glosses over the broad, unambiguous \nlanguage of   \u00a7 387l(a)(1)\u2014language that is virtually \nidentical to the omnibus Administrative Procedure \n\n8 \n \n \nAct (APA) judicial review provision, which states that \n\u201c[a] person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action. . . is entitled to judicial review.\u201d   \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court repeatedly has explained \nthat in the APA context the zone of interests test \u201cis \nnot especially demanding . . . the benefit of any doubt \ngoes to the plaintiff.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).  Given the close \nsimilarity in statutory language, the same \u201clenient \napproach\u201d that this Court affords to the APA\u2019s judicial \nreview provision, Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, should \napply to the right to judicial review under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1).   \n \nB. FDA\u2019s marketing denial adversely affects \nRespondent retailers \n \n1.  Unable to avoid the fact that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \nexpressly refers to \u201cany person\u201d\u2014not merely to an \napplicant for marketing authorization\u2014FDA argues \nthat the zone of interests test governs the meaning of \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d in \u00a7 387l(a)(1) and precludes \nretailers from \u201cchalleng[ing] an order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s \napplication \nfor \nmarketing \nauthorization.\u201d  FDA Br. at 13.  Under the zone of \ninterests test, courts \u201cpresume that a statutory cause \nof action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law \ninvoked.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990) (\u201c[T]o be \n\n9 \n \n \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the \nmeaning\u2019 of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the \nadverse effect upon him) falls within the \u2018zone of \ninterests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statutory \nprovision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \ncomplaint.\u201d). \n \nBecause the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue . . . what \ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative \naction under the generous review provisions of the \nAPA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FDA \nis mistaken this potential distinction between the APA \nand a statute-specific judicial review provision means \nthat the lenient approach afforded to the zone of \ninterests test in APA judicial review cases \u201cdoes not   \n. . . carry over to other statutes.\u201d  FDA Br. at 12.  \nNonetheless, seizing upon what it erroneously asserts \nis a categorical difference between APA and non-APA \ncases, FDA argues that for purposes of seeking judicial \nreview of a marketing denial under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \u201c[a] \nretailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 13. \n \n2.  FDA points to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c) as the TCA \nprovision whose zone of interests supposedly governs \nthe right of any adversely affected person to obtain \njudicial review of marketing denials.  That section, \ntitled \u201cAction on application,\u201d establishes procedures \n\n10 \n \n \nand standards for FDA\u2019s review of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for a \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d marketing \nauthorization, including for e-cigarettes.  See RJRV, \n65 F.4th at 187-88 (summarizing TCA statutory and \nregulatory background); Wages & White Lion Invests., \nLLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2024)  \n(en banc) (same).  \n  \nAccording to FDA, \u00a7 387j(c) \u201cprotects  . . . only the \ninterests of the applicant itself,\u201d not \u201cthe interests of \nretail sellers of the applicant\u2019s products.\u201d  FDA Br. at \n14.  Elevating form over substance, FDA asserts that \nbecause a marketing approval or denial order under   \n\u00a7 387j(c) is \u201cissued to the applicant alone,\u201d id., retail \nsellers of the product are not encompassed by    \n\u00a7 387j(c)\u2019s zone of interests. \n \nEven assuming that the right to judicial review \nunder \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is limited to the zone of interests \ncircumscribed by \u00a7 387j(c), Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests squarely fit within that zone.  This is not a \ncase where \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Lexmark, 572 \nU.S. at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nFDA simply is wrong that because a marketing \ndenial order is facially directed to the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer), it \u201cregulates only the applicant.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 14.  FDA\u2019s October 12, 2023 marketing denial \nletter (i.e., order), App. 9a, declares that the Vuse   \ne-cigarette products at issue are both \u201cmisbranded\u201d \n\n11 \n \n \nand \u201cadulterated,\u201d and are prohibited from being \n\u201cintroduce[d] or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate \ncommerce.\u201d \n \nId. \n10a, \n14a. \n \nFDA \nacknowledges \nthat \n\u201c[i]f \na \nmanufacturer \nlacks \nauthorization to sell a product, retailers cannot \nlawfully obtain and resell it.\u201d  FDA Br. at 14; see        \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (prohibiting \u201c[t]he introduction or \ndelivery for introduction into interstate commerce of \nany . . . tobacco product . . . that is adulterated or \nmisbranded\u201d).  What FDA refers to as an \u201cindirect \neffect\u201d of a marketing denial order, FDA Br. at 14, can \nhave \ndirect \nand \nserious \nconsequences \nfor \nnoncompliant retailers.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 \n(Penalties); id. \u00a7 333(a)(1) (criminal penalties for \n\u201c[a]ny person who violates a provision of section 331\u201d) \n(emphasis added); id. \u00a7 333(f)(9) (civil monetary \npenalties for violation of tobacco product requirements \nby \u201c[a]ny person\u201d) (emphasis added); see also 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E) (seizure of \u201c[a]ny adulterated or \nmisbranded tobacco product\u201d).   \n \nFDA\u2019s brief alleges that Respondent retailers \nengaged in \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by selling e-cigarettes \nboth \nbefore \nand \nafter \ndenial \nof \nmarketing \nauthorization.  FDA Br. at 8.  This assertion not only \nis unfounded, but also disingenuous in light of FDA\u2019s \npublicly announced compliance/enforcement policy \nallowing certain preexisting e-cigarettes to remain on \nthe market pending submission and review of \nmarketing authorization applications.  See 81 Fed. \nReg. at 28,977.  Nonetheless, FDA\u2019s insinuation that \nRespondent retailers may be in legal jeopardy in light \n\n12 \n \n \nof the marketing denial order underscores why they \nare adversely affected by the denial. \n \n3.  As the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying FDA\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss or Transfer reflects, the agency\u2019s \narguments \nthat \nRespondent \nretailers \nare \nnot \nadversely affected by the marketing authorization \ndenial for purposes of seeking judicial review under   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) are \u201cunavailing.\u201d  App. 4a.  Indeed, FDA\u2019s \ncontention that Respondent retailers lack statutory \nstanding defies common sense, especially in view of \nthe undisputed evidence that Respondent Avail Vapor \nTexas would go out of business if the denial order goes \ninto effect.  Id.   \n \nThe Court held in Lexmark, a frequently cited case \non statutory standing, that \u201calleg[ing] an injury to a \ncommercial interest in reputation or sales\u201d was \nenough to satisfy the zone of interests for the false \nadvertising statute involved in that case.  572 U.S. at \n132; cf.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin a case to satisfy Article III standing requirements).  \nGiven the injury to their commercial interests, i.e., \nsales, and possibly reputational harm, that they will \nsuffer if FDA\u2019s marketing denial goes into effect, \nRespondent retailers have enough of a personal stake \n\n13 \n \n \nin this case, i.e., statutory as well as Article III \nstanding, to challenge FDA\u2019s denial order.5   \n \n4.  The Court should take a broader view of the \napplicable zone of interests than the \u00a7 387j(c) \nmarketing denial procedures on which FDA predicates \nit superficial statutory standing arguments.  Section \n387j(c) also contains a statutory standard for granting \nor denying new tobacco product, including e-cigarette, \nmarketing applications: \u201cprotection of the public \nhealth.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 387j(c)(2)(A), 387j(c)(4), \n387j(c)(5)(A).   \n \nAs indicated above, FDA determined that retail \nsales of certain preexisting e-cigarette products could \ncontinue pending submission and review of marketing \nauthorization applications.  FDA\u2019s stated rationale for \nthis carefully considered compliance/enforcement \n \n5 In Lexmark the Court criticized use of the term \u201cprudential \nstanding\u201d as \u201cmisleading\u201d  because \u201cdeclin[ing] to adjudicate [a] \nclaim \non \ngrounds \nthat \nare \n\u2018prudential,\u2019 \nrather \nthan \nconstitutional\u201d where a plaintiff has Article III standing (as \nRespondents do here) \u201cis in some tension with [the Court\u2019s] \nreaffirmation of the principle that a federal court\u2019s obligation to \nhear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually \nunflagging.\u201d  572 U.S. at 125-26; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. \nCity of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017) (\u201cIn Lexmark we said \nthat the label \u2018prudential standing\u2019 was misleading, for the \nrequirement at issue is in reality is tied to a particular statute.  \nThe question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause \nof action that he asserts.\u201d). Thus, referring to \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d in connection with a statute\u2019s zone of interests is more \napt.  Id. at 1302-03.         \n\n14 \n \n \npolicy was in part protection of public health\u2014\nspecifically, continuing to make certain e-cigarette \nproducts available to adults who want \u201cto transition \naway from combusted tobacco use.\u201d  81 Fed. Reg. at \n28,977. Retailers\u2019 commercial interests in continuing \nto make such e-cigarette products available to \ncombusted-tobacco transitioning adults align with the \npublic health-related interests identified by FDA and \nexpressly incorporated into \u00a7 387j(c).  In other words, \nby making e-cigarettes available to the adult public, \nRespondent retailers facilitate the public health \ninterests that FDA has identified.  FDA\u2019s public health \nrationale is another reason why Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests are adversely affected by FDA\u2019s marketing \nauthorization denial, and thus, why the retailers have \nstatutory standing to seek judicial review.  Cf. Env\u2019t \nDef. Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. \n1970) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected \nby the [pesticide registration] statute includes not \nonly the economic interest of the registrant but also \nthe interest of the public in safety.\u201d). \n \n5.  In short, this Court, like the court of appeals, \nshould follow a common-sense approach and affirm \nthat the Respondent retailers have statutory standing \nto challenge FDA\u2019s marketing denial.  \nC. This Court\u2019s ruling may affect the \navailability of judicial review under \nnumerous other statutes  \n \nAccording to a recent survey conducted for the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States, there \n\n15 \n \n \nare \u201cover 650 specific judicial review provisions in the \nUnited States Code.\u201d  Jonathan R. Siegel, The ACUS \nSourcebook of Federal Judicial Review Statutes, \nAdmin. Conf. of the U.S. 37 (Jan. 2022).  Dozens of \nthem, in addition to the APA and \u00a7 387l(a)(1), afford \njudicial review to any person adversely affected by an \nagency action.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360g(a)(9) \n(medical devices); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348(g) (food additives); \n7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136n(b) (pesticides); 15 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 2060(a) & \n2064(j)(2) (Consumer Product Safety Commission \nrules);  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission citations).  \n      If adopted by this Court, the constricted, form-\nover-substance zone of interests interpretation that \nFDA is advocating here as a way of avoiding review in \nthe Fifth Circuit may have repercussions for judicial-\nreview-seeking adversely affected businesses and \nindividuals far beyond the world of e-cigarettes.  \nAlthough the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue,\u201d Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 163, the Court should adopt and apply the \nsame \u201clenient approach\u201d for statute-specific judicial \nreview provisions as it has for judicial review under \nthe APA.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  At the very least \nthe Court should do so for judicial review provisions \nwhich, like \u00a7 387l(a)(1), use language that is identical \nor nearly identical to \u201cthe APA\u2019s omnibus judicial-\nreview provision,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, \u201cas an appropriate \nmeans of preserving the flexibility\u201d of such broad \nentitlements to judicial review.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n130.    \n\n16 \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the Court should hold, at least \nfor judicial review provisions that expressly apply to \nany person adversely affected by an agency action, \nthat the zone of interests test is whether \u201cthe interest \nsought to be protected by the complainant is arguably \nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or \nregulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in \nquestion.\u201d  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  The \nCourt has \u201coften \u2018conspicuously included the word \n\u201carguably\u201d in the test to indicate that the benefit of \nany doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u2019\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n130 (quoting Patchak, 567 U.S. at 225).  \n \nThe Court did exactly that in Bank of America \nCorp. v. City of Miami, which involved Fair Housing \nAct statute-specific judicial review provisions that \n\u201callow[] any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 to file a civil action \nseeking damages for a violation of the statute.\u201d  137   \nS. Ct.  at 1300.  Plaintiff City of Miami filed suit \nagainst two banks for allegedly violating the Act.  This \nCourt held that \u201cthe City\u2019s claimed injuries fall within \nthe zone of interests that the FHA arguably protects.\u201d  \nId. at 1301 (emphasis added). \n \nAs Justice Scalia recognized in Bennett, finding \nstatutory standing where a plaintiff\u2019s interests are at \nleast \u201carguably\u201d within a statute\u2019s zone of interests is \nappropriate because a plaintiff (or petitioner in a court \nof appeals) still must satisfy the \u201cimmutable \nrequirements of Article III,\u201d  520 U.S. at 162, which \nFDA apparently recognizes Respondents satisfy here.  \nThere is no principled reason why plaintiffs (or court \n\n17 \n \n \nof appeals petitioners) that invoke statute-specific \njudicial review provisions should be deprived of the \nsame broad view that is applied in challenges arising \nunder the APA.  For the reasons already discussed, the \nretailers\u2019 interests in challenging FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial are not merely arguably, but squarely, within \nthe TCA\u2019s zone of interests.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case, built upon the initial petition and opposition, was substantially refined by the Petitioner's (FDA's) Reply Brief, which provided powerful counter-arguments and reframed the stakes. My beliefs are now updated as follows:\n\nMy foundational understanding of the core arguments remains intact. The FDA argues for a narrow interpretation of \"adversely affected\" as a legal term of art tied to the statute's \"zone of interests,\" and it defends the traditional rule that each petitioner must independently satisfy venue requirements to prevent forum shopping. The Respondents (RJR Vapor et al.) advocate for a plain-text reading of \"any person adversely affected\" and rely on modern, liberal joinder principles.\n\nThe FDA's Reply Brief added several crucial dimensions to my beliefs by directly rebutting the Respondents' case:\n*   **\"Adversely Affected\" as a Term of Art:** The FDA's citation to *Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding* and Scalia & Garner's *Reading Law* provides a strong counter to the plain-text argument. This shifts the interpretive battleground from simple dictionary definitions to a more complex analysis of statutory context and legal custom, arguing that the phrase's meaning is derived from the specific statutory scheme.\n*   **Structural Inconsistency:** The FDA's structural argument\u2014that Congress could not have intended for retailers to have standing to challenge a denial order when they lack notice or access to the confidential application, and cannot even challenge a more direct harm like a product withdrawal\u2014is a compelling point. It frames the retailers' interest as \"entirely derivative\" and adequately represented by the manufacturer.\n*   **Distinguishing Precedents:** The FDA has provided plausible distinctions for RJR's key permissive standing cases, arguing *Patchak* involved the general APA provision (not a specific statute) and *Bank of America* concerned a statute with an exceptionally broad definition of \"aggrieved person\" not present in the Tobacco Control Act (TCA).\n*   **Reinforcing Venue Rules:** The FDA defends its reliance on traditional venue rules (*Smith v. Lyon*) as a default and argues that Respondents' counter-examples are based on specific legislative histories absent in the TCA. The FDA also points to the Tenth Circuit's decision in *Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commission* as creating a direct circuit conflict on this issue.\n\nThe Reply Brief also significantly strengthened the case for why the Court must intervene now, addressing the institutional stakes:\n*   **Urgency and Forum Shopping:** The FDA effectively counters the claim that this is a \"rare\" issue by documenting the growth of this venue maneuver in the Fifth Circuit (from six to nine cases). The argument that the Fifth Circuit has become a \"magnet\" jurisdiction, which *prevents* a circuit split from developing by channeling all such cases there, presents a powerful institutional reason for the Court to step in.\n*   **Public Health Narrative:** By citing CDC data identifying Vuse as a top e-cigarette brand among youth, the FDA elevates the case from a dry procedural matter to one with tangible public health consequences, which may increase the perceived importance of the case.\n*   **Overcoming Procedural Hurdles:** The FDA provided strong answers to RJR's procedural defenses. Citing *Yee v. City of Escondido* and *United States v. Williams*, the FDA argues the venue claim was properly preserved and \"passed upon\" below. Critically, the citation to *National Ass'n of Manufacturers v. Dept. of Defense* serves as direct precedent for the Court granting certiorari to resolve an interlocutory venue dispute from a court of appeals, neutralizing a major potential obstacle.\n\nThe internal synthesis of the parties' core certiorari-stage briefing confirms and solidifies the conclusions drawn from the FDA's Reply Brief. My belief state has now coalesced into a strong expectation that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari and ultimately reverse the Fifth Circuit, answering 'No' to the legal question. The FDA's arguments regarding the 'magnet jurisdiction' effect, the public health stakes, and the direct precedent for reviewing interlocutory venue decisions (*NAM v. DoD*) appear to have created a compelling case for intervention that overcomes the respondents' procedural objections and textualist arguments. While my prediction on the merits is now leaning strongly toward the FDA, I recognize that this is based solely on the parties' legal arguments. The next crucial step is to analyze the amicus briefs. These briefs will be highly informative for refining my prediction, as they may introduce novel legal theories, empirical data on forum shopping, or broader policy arguments about administrative efficiency and public health that could sway the Justices' final decision on the merits.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My belief state, which had solidified around a strong expectation of reversal for the FDA after its Reply Brief, has now been significantly moderated by the introduction of a compelling amicus brief from the Atlantic Legal Foundation (ALF) in support of the Respondents. My foundational understanding of the case's core arguments remains, but the ALF brief provides a robust and sophisticated counter-narrative that adds considerable weight to the Respondents' position on statutory standing.\n\nMy prior beliefs, shaped by the cert-stage briefing, were that the FDA had the stronger argument. I was persuaded that \"adversely affected\" was a legal term of art tied to the statute's \"zone of interests,\" that the retailers' harm was merely derivative, and that the institutional need to curb \"magnet jurisdiction\" forum shopping made Supreme Court intervention and reversal highly likely. The FDA's citation to *NAM v. DoD* seemed to neutralize the procedural hurdle of reviewing an interlocutory venue dispute.\n\nThe observation of the ALF amicus brief introduces several powerful counterpoints that directly challenge and weaken my prior assessment of the FDA's arguments:\n\n*   **Strengthening the Plain Text/Structural Argument:** While I previously saw the Respondents' argument as a simple \"plain text\" reading, the ALF brief reframes it as a sophisticated structural argument. It highlights that Congress knew how to limit judicial review to just the applicant\u2014as it did for withdrawal orders in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2)\u2014but chose not to in the provision for denial orders (\u00a7 387l(a)(1)). Instead, Congress used the broad phrase \"any person adversely affected,\" a choice ALF argues must be presumed intentional. This adds significant analytical depth to the Respondents' position, moving it beyond a dictionary definition to a classic canon of statutory construction.\n\n*   **Reframing Retailer Harm as Direct, Not Derivative:** My previous belief was that the retailers' harm was indirect and purely economic. The ALF brief powerfully refutes this by pointing out the direct legal consequences a denial order triggers for retailers. The order renders the products \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated,\" making retailers who sell them subject to direct federal enforcement actions, including criminal penalties (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(a)(1)), civil monetary penalties (\u00a7 333(f)(9)), and product seizure (\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E)). This recasts the injury from a secondary economic effect to a primary legal jeopardy, making the \"adverse effect\" far more concrete and direct.\n\n*   **Expanding the \"Zone of Interests\":** The FDA had argued the retailers fall outside the \"zone of interests\" of the application-review provision. The ALF brief cleverly turns the FDA's own public health rationale against it. By citing the FDA's 2016 rule, which acknowledged the public health benefit of e-cigarettes for adults transitioning from combustible tobacco, ALF argues that retailers who make these products available are, in fact, helping to serve one of the statute's core purposes. This places their interests squarely within the statute's \"zone of interests,\" countering the FDA's narrow, applicant-centric interpretation.\n\n*   **Broadening the Institutional Stakes:** The FDA framed the institutional stakes around preventing forum shopping and protecting public health. ALF introduces a competing institutional concern: the integrity of judicial review across the administrative state. By listing numerous other statutes that use the same \"any person adversely affected\" language (for medical devices, pesticides, food additives, etc.), ALF warns that a narrow ruling for the FDA could have far-reaching, negative consequences, stripping many businesses of their ability to challenge agency actions that harm them. This \"parade of horribles\" argument presents the Court with a systemic reason to favor a broader interpretation of standing.\n\nIn sum, the ALF amicus brief has substantially increased the perceived strength of the Respondents' legal arguments on the merits of the standing question. While the FDA's arguments about the practical problem of forum shopping remain potent and unrefuted by this brief, the underlying legal question of whether retailers are \"adversely affected\" now appears far more balanced. My confidence in an ultimate reversal for the FDA has decreased. The case now looks less like a straightforward correction of a lower court's procedural error and more like a significant statutory interpretation case with broad implications for administrative law. The path to a 'No' answer on the legal question is no longer as clear, and a decision affirming the Fifth Circuit on standing seems more plausible.",

A finding of no significant support would be a powerful signal in itself, strengthening the case for affirmance. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high. The Design EIG is also high because this action tests a key hypothesis about the predictive power of asymmetric amicus support\u2014is the absence of support for a government party as telling as the presence of support for their opponent?

ALF\u2019s mission is to advance the rule \nof law and civil justice by advocating for individual \nliberty, free enterprise, property rights, limited and \nresponsible government, sound science in judicial and \nregulatory proceedings, and effective education, \nincluding parental rights and school choice.  With the \nbenefit of guidance from the distinguished legal \nscholars, corporate legal officers, private practitioners, \nbusiness executives, and prominent scientists who \nserve on its Board of Directors and Advisory Council, \nALF pursues its mission by participating as amicus \ncuriae in carefully selected appeals before the \nSupreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and state \nsupreme courts.  See atlanticlegal.org. \n* * * \n  \nThis \nappeal \nconcerns \nthe \nability \nof \nthe \nmanufacturer and retailers of a federally regulated \nproduct to jointly challenge, in a single federal court of \nappeals, a final agency action that directly and \nindisputably \nimpairs \ntheir \nshared \ncommercial \ninterests.

Instead, this \namicus brief focuses on the question of whether a Vuse \ne-cigarette retailer has statutory standing to obtain \njudicial review of FDA\u2019s denial.  At least one retailer, \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C., has been \nselling Vuse e-cigarettes since before FDA decided to \ndeny authorization to market them as \u201cnew tobacco \nproducts\u201d under the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387 et seq.2 \nAvail has stated that it \u201cwould \u2018cease business \noperations\u2019 if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into effect.\u201d  \nApp. 5a.3 \n \n2 The TCA was enacted in 2009 as subchapter IX of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.  In 2016 \nFDA deemed e-cigarettes to be \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d subject to \nthe TCA.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j; 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, \n2016).     \n3 The Fifth Circuit has stayed FDA\u2019s marketing denial pending \ndisposition of this appeal.  See Brief for the Petitioners (\u201cFDA \nBr.\u201d) at 7.    \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn its Order denying FDA\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or \nTransfer, the Fifth Circuit held\u2014not surprisingly\u2014 \nthat the TCA \u201cgrants the Petitioners [Respondents \nhere] statutory standing to challenge FDA decisions \nthat affect them.\u201d  App. 4a.  \u201cAll the Petitioners have \nstatutory standing as \u2018person[s] adversely affected\u2019 \nunder the [TCA].\u201d  Id. 5a (quoting 21 U.S.C.    \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1)).       \n \nThis Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order.  \nIndeed, ALF believes that the question of statutory \nstanding \npresented \nin \nthis \ncase \ntranscends   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), the TCA judicial review provision at issue.  \nHaving granted certiorari, the Court now has an \nimportant opportunity to reaffirm, or at least clarify, \nthe breadth of a statute-specific right to judicial \nreview that encompasses \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a final agency action.4    \n \n4 ALF defers to Respondents as to why the Court also should \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the equally important \nquestion of whether venue under \u00a7 387l(a)(1) must be satisfied \nindependently by each joint petitioner for judicial review of an \nFDA tobacco product marketing denial.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes and two of the same Respondents as \nhere\u2014R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) and Mississippi \nPetroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association\u2014the \nFifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit.\u201d    \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA (\u201cRJRV\u201d), 65 F.4th 182, 188   \n(5th Cir. 2023); see also App. 4a (\u201cStare decisis governs venue   \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThis Court, like the Fifth Circuit, should reject \nFDA\u2019s narrow and self-serving interpretation of the \nTCA judicial review provision at issue, 21 U.S.C.        \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1).  That plainly and broadly worded \nprovision entitles \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by \nan FDA \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d (e.g., e-cigarette) \nmarketing authorization denial to file a petition for \njudicial review (emphasis added).  But FDA argues \nthat  \u00a7 387l(a)(1) applies only to manufacturers.  \nPlacing form over substance, FDA contends that   \ne-cigarette retailers are excluded because despite the \neconomic consequences they suffer where, as here, the \nagency denies an e-cigarette marketing authorization, \nit is the manufacturer that submits the application for \nmarketing approval and that is the addressee on \nFDA\u2019s denial order.    \n \nhere so long as the distributors have standing, which they do.\u201d). \n     FDA\u2019s elaborate but strained arguments that Respondent \nretailers lack statutory standing are part of its attempt to keep \nthis appeal (and related Vuse e-cigarette appeals) out of the   \nFifth Circuit.  The agency\u2019s effort to compel RJRV to pursue its \nchallenge to FDA\u2019s Vuse e-cigarette marketing denials in either \nthe D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit\u2014which FDA claims \nalready have rejected the principal legal theory on which RJRV\u2019s \nchallenge relies\u2014is no less a type of \u201cforum shopping\u201d than what \nFDA accuses the Fifth Circuit of condoning.  See FDA Br. at 4-5; \nsee also App. 5a.        \n\n5 \n \n \n \nFDA\u2019s convoluted arguments about statutory \nstanding defy common sense, as well as the text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), which refers to judicial review of a \n\u201cdenial,\u201d not of a denial \u201corder.\u201d  The Court should \nview the zone of interests for determining who is \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by a marketing denial, and thus \nhas the right to judicial review, as leniently for  \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) as it does for the Administrative \nProcedure Act\u2019s almost identically worded judicial \nreview provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that the benefit of any doubt \nshould go to the plaintiff, here the Respondents,  \nincluding the retailers.  \n \nThere are many additional federal statutes \ncontaining judicial review provisions that expressly \napply to any person adversely affected by a final \nagency action.  If this Court were to adopt FDA\u2019s \nnarrow, superficial, and inflexible approach for \nidentifying the zone of interests for statutory standing \npurposes, a great variety of businesses subject to other \nfederal statutes may be deprived of the opportunity to \nchallenge agency actions that are detrimental to their \neconomic, \nreputational, \nand/or \nother \ninterests.  \nInstead, the Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Respondent retailers, as well as \nRespondent RJRV, have statutory standing to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s e-cigarette marketing denial.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nRespondent E-Cigarette Retailers   \nHave Statutory Standing \n \nA. The judicial review provision should be \nconstrued broadly   \n \nSection \u00a7 387l(a)(1) states in part that \u201cany person \nadversely affected by . . . denial [of a \u201cnew tobacco \nproduct\u201d marketing application] may file a petition for \njudicial review of such . . . denial.\u201d  FDA argues that \nthis broadly worded judicial review provision is \nlimited to manufacturers.  The agency\u2019s contrived \ncontention that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) excludes e-cigarette \nretailers is wrong.  It is an advocacy position \ncalculated to prevent the Fifth Circuit\u2014where venue \nunquestionably \nis \nproper \nfor \nthe \nRespondent \nretailers\u2014from addressing the merits of FDA\u2019s Vuse \ne-cigarette marketing denials.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes, the Fifth Circuit not only \nhas held that venue is proper, see supra n. 4, but also \nthat success on the merits is likely.  See RJRV, 65 \nF.4th at 188, 189-94.     \n \n1.  According to FDA, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \u201cshows no . . . \nsolicitude for retailers.\u201d  FDA Br. at 7.  FDA argues \nthat the marketing denial \u201corder that FDA issues . . . \nspeaks to the applicant alone (always or nearly always \na manufacturer of the product) and affects retailers \nonly indirectly.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  The term \n\u201corder,\u201d however, does not appear in  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \nwhich instead twice refers more broadly to judicial \nreview of a \u201cdenial.\u201d  Other subsections of  \u00a7 387l do \n\n7 \n \n \nrefer to a denial \u201corder.\u201d  See, e.g., \u00a7 387l(a)(2)(B) \n(Record of proceedings);  387l(b) (Standard of review).  \nBut unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1), these and other subsections \nthat facilitate judicial review of marketing denial \norders do not specify who is entitled to file a petition \nfor review of such an order.   \n \nIf Congress had wanted to limit the right to judicial \nreview of denials to applicants for marketing \nauthorization, it would have said so in \u00a7 387l(a)(1), as \nit did in connection with FDA withdrawals of \nmarketing authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) \n(referring to \u201c[t]he holder of an application subject to \n[a withdrawal] order\u201d).  Instead, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) expressly \nauthorizes a petition for judicial review of a marketing \ndenial to be filed by \u201cany person adversely affected by \nsuch . . .  denial\u201d (emphasis added).  This is \u201can \nauthorization of remarkable breadth.\u201d  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  As the Fifth Circuit \nobserved in its Order here, \u201c\u2018[w]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019\u201d  \nApp. 4a (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. \n16, 23 (1983)).    \n \n2.  Turning a blind eye to the plain text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), FDA invokes the \u201czone of interests\u201d test \nfor statutory standing to sue.  FDA Br. at 12. In so \ndoing, FDA glosses over the broad, unambiguous \nlanguage of   \u00a7 387l(a)(1)\u2014language that is virtually \nidentical to the omnibus Administrative Procedure \n\n8 \n \n \nAct (APA) judicial review provision, which states that \n\u201c[a] person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action. . . is entitled to judicial review.\u201d   \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court repeatedly has explained \nthat in the APA context the zone of interests test \u201cis \nnot especially demanding . . . the benefit of any doubt \ngoes to the plaintiff.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).  Given the close \nsimilarity in statutory language, the same \u201clenient \napproach\u201d that this Court affords to the APA\u2019s judicial \nreview provision, Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, should \napply to the right to judicial review under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1).   \n \nB. FDA\u2019s marketing denial adversely affects \nRespondent retailers \n \n1.  Unable to avoid the fact that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \nexpressly refers to \u201cany person\u201d\u2014not merely to an \napplicant for marketing authorization\u2014FDA argues \nthat the zone of interests test governs the meaning of \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d in \u00a7 387l(a)(1) and precludes \nretailers from \u201cchalleng[ing] an order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s \napplication \nfor \nmarketing \nauthorization.\u201d  FDA Br. at 13.  Under the zone of \ninterests test, courts \u201cpresume that a statutory cause \nof action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law \ninvoked.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990) (\u201c[T]o be \n\n9 \n \n \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the \nmeaning\u2019 of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the \nadverse effect upon him) falls within the \u2018zone of \ninterests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statutory \nprovision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \ncomplaint.\u201d). \n \nBecause the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue . . . what \ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative \naction under the generous review provisions of the \nAPA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FDA \nis mistaken this potential distinction between the APA \nand a statute-specific judicial review provision means \nthat the lenient approach afforded to the zone of \ninterests test in APA judicial review cases \u201cdoes not   \n. . . carry over to other statutes.\u201d  FDA Br. at 12.  \nNonetheless, seizing upon what it erroneously asserts \nis a categorical difference between APA and non-APA \ncases, FDA argues that for purposes of seeking judicial \nreview of a marketing denial under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \u201c[a] \nretailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 13. \n \n2.  FDA points to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c) as the TCA \nprovision whose zone of interests supposedly governs \nthe right of any adversely affected person to obtain \njudicial review of marketing denials.  That section, \ntitled \u201cAction on application,\u201d establishes procedures \n\n10 \n \n \nand standards for FDA\u2019s review of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for a \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d marketing \nauthorization, including for e-cigarettes.  See RJRV, \n65 F.4th at 187-88 (summarizing TCA statutory and \nregulatory background); Wages & White Lion Invests., \nLLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2024)  \n(en banc) (same).  \n  \nAccording to FDA, \u00a7 387j(c) \u201cprotects  . . . only the \ninterests of the applicant itself,\u201d not \u201cthe interests of \nretail sellers of the applicant\u2019s products.\u201d  FDA Br. at \n14.  Elevating form over substance, FDA asserts that \nbecause a marketing approval or denial order under   \n\u00a7 387j(c) is \u201cissued to the applicant alone,\u201d id., retail \nsellers of the product are not encompassed by    \n\u00a7 387j(c)\u2019s zone of interests. \n \nEven assuming that the right to judicial review \nunder \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is limited to the zone of interests \ncircumscribed by \u00a7 387j(c), Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests squarely fit within that zone.  This is not a \ncase where \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Lexmark, 572 \nU.S. at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nFDA simply is wrong that because a marketing \ndenial order is facially directed to the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer), it \u201cregulates only the applicant.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 14.  FDA\u2019s October 12, 2023 marketing denial \nletter (i.e., order), App. 9a, declares that the Vuse   \ne-cigarette products at issue are both \u201cmisbranded\u201d \n\n11 \n \n \nand \u201cadulterated,\u201d and are prohibited from being \n\u201cintroduce[d] or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate \ncommerce.\u201d \n \nId. \n10a, \n14a. \n \nFDA \nacknowledges \nthat \n\u201c[i]f \na \nmanufacturer \nlacks \nauthorization to sell a product, retailers cannot \nlawfully obtain and resell it.\u201d  FDA Br. at 14; see        \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (prohibiting \u201c[t]he introduction or \ndelivery for introduction into interstate commerce of \nany . . . tobacco product . . . that is adulterated or \nmisbranded\u201d).  What FDA refers to as an \u201cindirect \neffect\u201d of a marketing denial order, FDA Br. at 14, can \nhave \ndirect \nand \nserious \nconsequences \nfor \nnoncompliant retailers.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 \n(Penalties); id. \u00a7 333(a)(1) (criminal penalties for \n\u201c[a]ny person who violates a provision of section 331\u201d) \n(emphasis added); id. \u00a7 333(f)(9) (civil monetary \npenalties for violation of tobacco product requirements \nby \u201c[a]ny person\u201d) (emphasis added); see also 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E) (seizure of \u201c[a]ny adulterated or \nmisbranded tobacco product\u201d).   \n \nFDA\u2019s brief alleges that Respondent retailers \nengaged in \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by selling e-cigarettes \nboth \nbefore \nand \nafter \ndenial \nof \nmarketing \nauthorization.  FDA Br. at 8.  This assertion not only \nis unfounded, but also disingenuous in light of FDA\u2019s \npublicly announced compliance/enforcement policy \nallowing certain preexisting e-cigarettes to remain on \nthe market pending submission and review of \nmarketing authorization applications.  See 81 Fed. \nReg. at 28,977.  Nonetheless, FDA\u2019s insinuation that \nRespondent retailers may be in legal jeopardy in light \n\n12 \n \n \nof the marketing denial order underscores why they \nare adversely affected by the denial. \n \n3.  As the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying FDA\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss or Transfer reflects, the agency\u2019s \narguments \nthat \nRespondent \nretailers \nare \nnot \nadversely affected by the marketing authorization \ndenial for purposes of seeking judicial review under   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) are \u201cunavailing.\u201d  App. 4a.  Indeed, FDA\u2019s \ncontention that Respondent retailers lack statutory \nstanding defies common sense, especially in view of \nthe undisputed evidence that Respondent Avail Vapor \nTexas would go out of business if the denial order goes \ninto effect.  Id.   \n \nThe Court held in Lexmark, a frequently cited case \non statutory standing, that \u201calleg[ing] an injury to a \ncommercial interest in reputation or sales\u201d was \nenough to satisfy the zone of interests for the false \nadvertising statute involved in that case.  572 U.S. at \n132; cf.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin a case to satisfy Article III standing requirements).  \nGiven the injury to their commercial interests, i.e., \nsales, and possibly reputational harm, that they will \nsuffer if FDA\u2019s marketing denial goes into effect, \nRespondent retailers have enough of a personal stake \n\n13 \n \n \nin this case, i.e., statutory as well as Article III \nstanding, to challenge FDA\u2019s denial order.5   \n \n4.  The Court should take a broader view of the \napplicable zone of interests than the \u00a7 387j(c) \nmarketing denial procedures on which FDA predicates \nit superficial statutory standing arguments.  Section \n387j(c) also contains a statutory standard for granting \nor denying new tobacco product, including e-cigarette, \nmarketing applications: \u201cprotection of the public \nhealth.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 387j(c)(2)(A), 387j(c)(4), \n387j(c)(5)(A).   \n \nAs indicated above, FDA determined that retail \nsales of certain preexisting e-cigarette products could \ncontinue pending submission and review of marketing \nauthorization applications.  FDA\u2019s stated rationale for \nthis carefully considered compliance/enforcement \n \n5 In Lexmark the Court criticized use of the term \u201cprudential \nstanding\u201d as \u201cmisleading\u201d  because \u201cdeclin[ing] to adjudicate [a] \nclaim \non \ngrounds \nthat \nare \n\u2018prudential,\u2019 \nrather \nthan \nconstitutional\u201d where a plaintiff has Article III standing (as \nRespondents do here) \u201cis in some tension with [the Court\u2019s] \nreaffirmation of the principle that a federal court\u2019s obligation to \nhear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually \nunflagging.\u201d  572 U.S. at 125-26; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. \nCity of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017) (\u201cIn Lexmark we said \nthat the label \u2018prudential standing\u2019 was misleading, for the \nrequirement at issue is in reality is tied to a particular statute.  \nThe question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause \nof action that he asserts.\u201d). Thus, referring to \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d in connection with a statute\u2019s zone of interests is more \napt.  Id. at 1302-03.         \n\n14 \n \n \npolicy was in part protection of public health\u2014\nspecifically, continuing to make certain e-cigarette \nproducts available to adults who want \u201cto transition \naway from combusted tobacco use.\u201d  81 Fed. Reg. at \n28,977. Retailers\u2019 commercial interests in continuing \nto make such e-cigarette products available to \ncombusted-tobacco transitioning adults align with the \npublic health-related interests identified by FDA and \nexpressly incorporated into \u00a7 387j(c).  In other words, \nby making e-cigarettes available to the adult public, \nRespondent retailers facilitate the public health \ninterests that FDA has identified.  FDA\u2019s public health \nrationale is another reason why Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests are adversely affected by FDA\u2019s marketing \nauthorization denial, and thus, why the retailers have \nstatutory standing to seek judicial review.  Cf. Env\u2019t \nDef. Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. \n1970) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected \nby the [pesticide registration] statute includes not \nonly the economic interest of the registrant but also \nthe interest of the public in safety.\u201d). \n \n5.  In short, this Court, like the court of appeals, \nshould follow a common-sense approach and affirm \nthat the Respondent retailers have statutory standing \nto challenge FDA\u2019s marketing denial.  \nC. This Court\u2019s ruling may affect the \navailability of judicial review under \nnumerous other statutes  \n \nAccording to a recent survey conducted for the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States, there \n\n15 \n \n \nare \u201cover 650 specific judicial review provisions in the \nUnited States Code.\u201d  Jonathan R. Siegel, The ACUS \nSourcebook of Federal Judicial Review Statutes, \nAdmin. Conf. of the U.S. 37 (Jan. 2022).  Dozens of \nthem, in addition to the APA and \u00a7 387l(a)(1), afford \njudicial review to any person adversely affected by an \nagency action.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360g(a)(9) \n(medical devices); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348(g) (food additives); \n7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136n(b) (pesticides); 15 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 2060(a) & \n2064(j)(2) (Consumer Product Safety Commission \nrules);  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission citations).  \n      If adopted by this Court, the constricted, form-\nover-substance zone of interests interpretation that\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

With the \nbenefit of guidance from the distinguished legal \nscholars, corporate legal officers, private practitioners, \nbusiness executives, and prominent scientists who \nserve on its Board of Directors and Advisory Council, \nALF pursues its mission by participating as amicus \ncuriae in carefully selected appeals before the \nSupreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and state \nsupreme courts.  See atlanticlegal.org. \n* * * \n  \nThis \nappeal \nconcerns \nthe \nability \nof \nthe \nmanufacturer and retailers of a federally regulated \nproduct to jointly challenge, in a single federal court of \nappeals, a final agency action that directly and \nindisputably \nimpairs \ntheir \nshared \ncommercial \ninterests.

Instead, this \namicus brief focuses on the question of whether a Vuse \ne-cigarette retailer has statutory standing to obtain \njudicial review of FDA\u2019s denial.  At least one retailer, \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C., has been \nselling Vuse e-cigarettes since before FDA decided to \ndeny authorization to market them as \u201cnew tobacco \nproducts\u201d under the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387 et seq.2 \nAvail has stated that it \u201cwould \u2018cease business \noperations\u2019 if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into effect.\u201d  \nApp. 5a.3 \n \n2 The TCA was enacted in 2009 as subchapter IX of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.  In 2016 \nFDA deemed e-cigarettes to be \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d subject to \nthe TCA.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j; 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, \n2016).     \n3 The Fifth Circuit has stayed FDA\u2019s marketing denial pending \ndisposition of this appeal.  See Brief for the Petitioners (\u201cFDA \nBr.\u201d) at 7.    \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn its Order denying FDA\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or \nTransfer, the Fifth Circuit held\u2014not surprisingly\u2014 \nthat the TCA \u201cgrants the Petitioners [Respondents \nhere] statutory standing to challenge FDA decisions \nthat affect them.\u201d  App. 4a.  \u201cAll the Petitioners have \nstatutory standing as \u2018person[s] adversely affected\u2019 \nunder the [TCA].\u201d  Id. 5a (quoting 21 U.S.C.    \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1)).       \n \nThis Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order.  \nIndeed, ALF believes that the question of statutory \nstanding \npresented \nin \nthis \ncase \ntranscends   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), the TCA judicial review provision at issue.  \nHaving granted certiorari, the Court now has an \nimportant opportunity to reaffirm, or at least clarify, \nthe breadth of a statute-specific right to judicial \nreview that encompasses \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a final agency action.4    \n \n4 ALF defers to Respondents as to why the Court also should \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the equally important \nquestion of whether venue under \u00a7 387l(a)(1) must be satisfied \nindependently by each joint petitioner for judicial review of an \nFDA tobacco product marketing denial.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes and two of the same Respondents as \nhere\u2014R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) and Mississippi \nPetroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association\u2014the \nFifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit.\u201d    \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA (\u201cRJRV\u201d), 65 F.4th 182, 188   \n(5th Cir. 2023); see also App. 4a (\u201cStare decisis governs venue   \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThis Court, like the Fifth Circuit, should reject \nFDA\u2019s narrow and self-serving interpretation of the \nTCA judicial review provision at issue, 21 U.S.C.        \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1).  That plainly and broadly worded \nprovision entitles \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by \nan FDA \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d (e.g., e-cigarette) \nmarketing authorization denial to file a petition for \njudicial review (emphasis added).  But FDA argues \nthat  \u00a7 387l(a)(1) applies only to manufacturers.  \nPlacing form over substance, FDA contends that   \ne-cigarette retailers are excluded because despite the \neconomic consequences they suffer where, as here, the \nagency denies an e-cigarette marketing authorization, \nit is the manufacturer that submits the application for \nmarketing approval and that is the addressee on \nFDA\u2019s denial order.    \n \nhere so long as the distributors have standing, which they do.\u201d). \n     FDA\u2019s elaborate but strained arguments that Respondent \nretailers lack statutory standing are part of its attempt to keep \nthis appeal (and related Vuse e-cigarette appeals) out of the   \nFifth Circuit.  The agency\u2019s effort to compel RJRV to pursue its \nchallenge to FDA\u2019s Vuse e-cigarette marketing denials in either \nthe D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit\u2014which FDA claims \nalready have rejected the principal legal theory on which RJRV\u2019s \nchallenge relies\u2014is no less a type of \u201cforum shopping\u201d than what \nFDA accuses the Fifth Circuit of condoning.  See FDA Br. at 4-5; \nsee also App. 5a.        \n\n5 \n \n \n \nFDA\u2019s convoluted arguments about statutory \nstanding defy common sense, as well as the text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), which refers to judicial review of a \n\u201cdenial,\u201d not of a denial \u201corder.\u201d  The Court should \nview the zone of interests for determining who is \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by a marketing denial, and thus \nhas the right to judicial review, as leniently for  \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) as it does for the Administrative \nProcedure Act\u2019s almost identically worded judicial \nreview provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that the benefit of any doubt \nshould go to the plaintiff, here the Respondents,  \nincluding the retailers.  \n \nThere are many additional federal statutes \ncontaining judicial review provisions that expressly \napply to any person adversely affected by a final \nagency action.  If this Court were to adopt FDA\u2019s \nnarrow, superficial, and inflexible approach for \nidentifying the zone of interests for statutory standing \npurposes, a great variety of businesses subject to other \nfederal statutes may be deprived of the opportunity to \nchallenge agency actions that are detrimental to their \neconomic, \nreputational, \nand/or \nother \ninterests.  \nInstead, the Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Respondent retailers, as well as \nRespondent RJRV, have statutory standing to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s e-cigarette marketing denial.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nRespondent E-Cigarette Retailers   \nHave Statutory Standing \n \nA. The judicial review provision should be \nconstrued broadly   \n \nSection \u00a7 387l(a)(1) states in part that \u201cany person \nadversely affected by . . . denial [of a \u201cnew tobacco \nproduct\u201d marketing application] may file a petition for \njudicial review of such . . . denial.\u201d  FDA argues that \nthis broadly worded judicial review provision is \nlimited to manufacturers.  The agency\u2019s contrived \ncontention that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) excludes e-cigarette \nretailers is wrong.  It is an advocacy position \ncalculated to prevent the Fifth Circuit\u2014where venue \nunquestionably \nis \nproper \nfor \nthe \nRespondent \nretailers\u2014from addressing the merits of FDA\u2019s Vuse \ne-cigarette marketing denials.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes, the Fifth Circuit not only \nhas held that venue is proper, see supra n. 4, but also \nthat success on the merits is likely.  See RJRV, 65 \nF.4th at 188, 189-94.     \n \n1.  According to FDA, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \u201cshows no . . . \nsolicitude for retailers.\u201d  FDA Br. at 7.  FDA argues \nthat the marketing denial \u201corder that FDA issues . . . \nspeaks to the applicant alone (always or nearly always \na manufacturer of the product) and affects retailers \nonly indirectly.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  The term \n\u201corder,\u201d however, does not appear in  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \nwhich instead twice refers more broadly to judicial \nreview of a \u201cdenial.\u201d  Other subsections of  \u00a7 387l do \n\n7 \n \n \nrefer to a denial \u201corder.\u201d  See, e.g., \u00a7 387l(a)(2)(B) \n(Record of proceedings);  387l(b) (Standard of review).  \nBut unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1), these and other subsections \nthat facilitate judicial review of marketing denial \norders do not specify who is entitled to file a petition \nfor review of such an order.   \n \nIf Congress had wanted to limit the right to judicial \nreview of denials to applicants for marketing \nauthorization, it would have said so in \u00a7 387l(a)(1), as \nit did in connection with FDA withdrawals of \nmarketing authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) \n(referring to \u201c[t]he holder of an application subject to \n[a withdrawal] order\u201d).  Instead, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) expressly \nauthorizes a petition for judicial review of a marketing \ndenial to be filed by \u201cany person adversely affected by \nsuch . . .  denial\u201d (emphasis added).  This is \u201can \nauthorization of remarkable breadth.\u201d  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  As the Fifth Circuit \nobserved in its Order here, \u201c\u2018[w]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019\u201d  \nApp. 4a (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. \n16, 23 (1983)).    \n \n2.  Turning a blind eye to the plain text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), FDA invokes the \u201czone of interests\u201d test \nfor statutory standing to sue.  FDA Br. at 12. In so \ndoing, FDA glosses over the broad, unambiguous \nlanguage of   \u00a7 387l(a)(1)\u2014language that is virtually \nidentical to the omnibus Administrative Procedure \n\n8 \n \n \nAct (APA) judicial review provision, which states that \n\u201c[a] person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action. . . is entitled to judicial review.\u201d   \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court repeatedly has explained \nthat in the APA context the zone of interests test \u201cis \nnot especially demanding . . . the benefit of any doubt \ngoes to the plaintiff.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).  Given the close \nsimilarity in statutory language, the same \u201clenient \napproach\u201d that this Court affords to the APA\u2019s judicial \nreview provision, Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, should \napply to the right to judicial review under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1).   \n \nB. FDA\u2019s marketing denial adversely affects \nRespondent retailers \n \n1.  Unable to avoid the fact that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \nexpressly refers to \u201cany person\u201d\u2014not merely to an \napplicant for marketing authorization\u2014FDA argues \nthat the zone of interests test governs the meaning of \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d in \u00a7 387l(a)(1) and precludes \nretailers from \u201cchalleng[ing] an order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s \napplication \nfor \nmarketing \nauthorization.\u201d  FDA Br. at 13.  Under the zone of \ninterests test, courts \u201cpresume that a statutory cause \nof action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law \ninvoked.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990) (\u201c[T]o be \n\n9 \n \n \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the \nmeaning\u2019 of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the \nadverse effect upon him) falls within the \u2018zone of \ninterests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statutory \nprovision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \ncomplaint.\u201d). \n \nBecause the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue . . . what \ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative \naction under the generous review provisions of the \nAPA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FDA \nis mistaken this potential distinction between the APA \nand a statute-specific judicial review provision means \nthat the lenient approach afforded to the zone of \ninterests test in APA judicial review cases \u201cdoes not   \n. . . carry over to other statutes.\u201d  FDA Br. at 12.  \nNonetheless, seizing upon what it erroneously asserts \nis a categorical difference between APA and non-APA \ncases, FDA argues that for purposes of seeking judicial \nreview of a marketing denial under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \u201c[a] \nretailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 13. \n \n2.  FDA points to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c) as the TCA \nprovision whose zone of interests supposedly governs \nthe right of any adversely affected person to obtain \njudicial review of marketing denials.  That section, \ntitled \u201cAction on application,\u201d establishes procedures \n\n10 \n \n \nand standards for FDA\u2019s review of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for a \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d marketing \nauthorization, including for e-cigarettes.  See RJRV, \n65 F.4th at 187-88 (summarizing TCA statutory and \nregulatory background); Wages & White Lion Invests., \nLLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2024)  \n(en banc) (same).  \n  \nAccording to FDA, \u00a7 387j(c) \u201cprotects  . . . only the \ninterests of the applicant itself,\u201d not \u201cthe interests of \nretail sellers of the applicant\u2019s products.\u201d  FDA Br. at \n14.  Elevating form over substance, FDA asserts that \nbecause a marketing approval or denial order under   \n\u00a7 387j(c) is \u201cissued to the applicant alone,\u201d id., retail \nsellers of the product are not encompassed by    \n\u00a7 387j(c)\u2019s zone of interests. \n \nEven assuming that the right to judicial review \nunder \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is limited to the zone of interests \ncircumscribed by \u00a7 387j(c), Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests squarely fit within that zone.  This is not a \ncase where \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Lexmark, 572 \nU.S. at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nFDA simply is wrong that because a marketing \ndenial order is facially directed to the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer), it \u201cregulates only the applicant.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 14.  FDA\u2019s October 12, 2023 marketing denial \nletter (i.e., order), App. 9a, declares that the Vuse   \ne-cigarette products at issue are both \u201cmisbranded\u201d \n\n11 \n \n \nand \u201cadulterated,\u201d and are prohibited from being \n\u201cintroduce[d] or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate \ncommerce.\u201d \n \nId. \n10a, \n14a. \n \nFDA \nacknowledges \nthat \n\u201c[i]f \na \nmanufacturer \nlacks \nauthorization to sell a product, retailers cannot \nlawfully obtain and resell it.\u201d  FDA Br. at 14; see        \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (prohibiting \u201c[t]he introduction or \ndelivery for introduction into interstate commerce of \nany . . . tobacco product . . . that is adulterated or \nmisbranded\u201d).  What FDA refers to as an \u201cindirect \neffect\u201d of a marketing denial order, FDA Br. at 14, can \nhave \ndirect \nand \nserious \nconsequences \nfor \nnoncompliant retailers.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 \n(Penalties); id. \u00a7 333(a)(1) (criminal penalties for \n\u201c[a]ny person who violates a provision of section 331\u201d) \n(emphasis added); id. \u00a7 333(f)(9) (civil monetary \npenalties for violation of tobacco product requirements \nby \u201c[a]ny person\u201d) (emphasis added); see also 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E) (seizure of \u201c[a]ny adulterated or \nmisbranded tobacco product\u201d).   \n \nFDA\u2019s brief alleges that Respondent retailers \nengaged in \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by selling e-cigarettes \nboth \nbefore \nand \nafter \ndenial \nof \nmarketing \nauthorization.  FDA Br. at 8.  This assertion not only \nis unfounded, but also disingenuous in light of FDA\u2019s \npublicly announced compliance/enforcement policy \nallowing certain preexisting e-cigarettes to remain on \nthe market pending submission and review of \nmarketing authorization applications.  See 81 Fed. \nReg. at 28,977.  Nonetheless, FDA\u2019s insinuation that \nRespondent retailers may be in legal jeopardy in light \n\n12 \n \n \nof the marketing denial order underscores why they \nare adversely affected by the denial. \n \n3.  As the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying FDA\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss or Transfer reflects, the agency\u2019s \narguments \nthat \nRespondent \nretailers \nare \nnot \nadversely affected by the marketing authorization \ndenial for purposes of seeking judicial review under   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) are \u201cunavailing.\u201d  App. 4a.  Indeed, FDA\u2019s \ncontention that Respondent retailers lack statutory \nstanding defies common sense, especially in view of \nthe undisputed evidence that Respondent Avail Vapor \nTexas would go out of business if the denial order goes \ninto effect.  Id.   \n \nThe Court held in Lexmark, a frequently cited case \non statutory standing, that \u201calleg[ing] an injury to a \ncommercial interest in reputation or sales\u201d was \nenough to satisfy the zone of interests for the false \nadvertising statute involved in that case.  572 U.S. at \n132; cf.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin a case to satisfy Article III standing requirements).  \nGiven the injury to their commercial interests, i.e., \nsales, and possibly reputational harm, that they will \nsuffer if FDA\u2019s marketing denial goes into effect, \nRespondent retailers have enough of a personal stake \n\n13 \n \n \nin this case, i.e., statutory as well as Article III \nstanding, to challenge FDA\u2019s denial order.5   \n \n4.  The Court should take a broader view of the \napplicable zone of interests than the \u00a7 387j(c) \nmarketing denial procedures on which FDA predicates \nit superficial statutory standing arguments.  Section \n387j(c) also contains a statutory standard for granting \nor denying new tobacco product, including e-cigarette, \nmarketing applications: \u201cprotection of the public \nhealth.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 387j(c)(2)(A), 387j(c)(4), \n387j(c)(5)(A).   \n \nAs indicated above, FDA determined that retail \nsales of certain preexisting e-cigarette products could \ncontinue pending submission and review of marketing \nauthorization applications.  FDA\u2019s stated rationale for \nthis carefully considered compliance/enforcement \n \n5 In Lexmark the Court criticized use of the term \u201cprudential \nstanding\u201d as \u201cmisleading\u201d  because \u201cdeclin[ing] to adjudicate [a] \nclaim \non \ngrounds \nthat \nare \n\u2018prudential,\u2019 \nrather \nthan \nconstitutional\u201d where a plaintiff has Article III standing (as \nRespondents do here) \u201cis in some tension with [the Court\u2019s] \nreaffirmation of the principle that a federal court\u2019s obligation to \nhear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually \nunflagging.\u201d  572 U.S. at 125-26; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. \nCity of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017) (\u201cIn Lexmark we said \nthat the label \u2018prudential standing\u2019 was misleading, for the \nrequirement at issue is in reality is tied to a particular statute.  \nThe question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause \nof action that he asserts.\u201d). Thus, referring to \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d in connection with a statute\u2019s zone of interests is more \napt.  Id. at 1302-03.         \n\n14 \n \n \npolicy was in part protection of public health\u2014\nspecifically, continuing to make certain e-cigarette \nproducts available to adults who want \u201cto transition \naway from combusted tobacco use.\u201d  81 Fed. Reg. at \n28,977. Retailers\u2019 commercial interests in continuing \nto make such e-cigarette products available to \ncombusted-tobacco transitioning adults align with the \npublic health-related interests identified by FDA and \nexpressly incorporated into \u00a7 387j(c).  In other words, \nby making e-cigarettes available to the adult public, \nRespondent retailers facilitate the public health \ninterests that FDA has identified.  FDA\u2019s public health \nrationale is another reason why Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests are adversely affected by FDA\u2019s marketing \nauthorization denial, and thus, why the retailers have \nstatutory standing to seek judicial review.  Cf. Env\u2019t \nDef. Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. \n1970) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected \nby the [pesticide registration] statute includes not \nonly the economic interest of the registrant but also \nthe interest of the public in safety.\u201d). \n \n5.  In short, this Court, like the court of appeals, \nshould follow a common-sense approach and affirm \nthat the Respondent retailers have statutory standing \nto challenge FDA\u2019s marketing denial.  \nC. This Court\u2019s ruling may affect the \navailability of judicial review under \nnumerous other statutes  \n \nAccording to a recent survey conducted for the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States, there \n\n15 \n \n \nare \u201cover 650 specific judicial review provisions in the \nUnited States Code.\u201d  Jonathan R. Siegel, The ACUS \nSourcebook of Federal Judicial Review Statutes, \nAdmin. Conf. of the U.S. 37 (Jan. 2022).  Dozens of \nthem, in addition to the APA and \u00a7 387l(a)(1), afford \njudicial review to any person adversely affected by an \nagency action.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360g(a)(9) \n(medical devices); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348(g) (food additives); \n7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136n(b) (pesticides); 15 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 2060(a) & \n2064(j)(2) (Consumer Product Safety Commission \nrules);  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission citations).  \n      If adopted by this Court, the constricted, form-\nover-substance zone of interests interpretation that \nFDA is advocating here as a way of avoiding review in \nthe Fifth Circuit may have repercussions for judicial-\nreview-seeking adversely affected businesses and \nindividuals far beyond the world of e-cigarettes.  \nAlthough the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue,\u201d Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 163, the Court should adopt and apply the \nsame \u201clenient approach\u201d for statute-specific judicial \nreview provisions as it has for judicial review under \nthe APA.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  At the very least \nthe Court should do so for judicial review provisions \nwhich, like \u00a7 387l(a)(1), use language that is identical \nor nearly identical to \u201cthe APA\u2019s omnibus judicial-\nreview provision,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, \u201cas an appropriate \nmeans of preserving the flexibility\u201d of such broad \nentitlements to judicial review.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n130.    \n\n16 \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the Court should hold, at least \nfor judicial review provisions that expressly apply to \nany person adversely affected by an agency action, \nthat the zone of interests test is whether \u201cthe interest \nsought to be protected by the complainant is arguably \nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or \nregulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in \nquestion.\u201d  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  The \nCourt has \u201coften \u2018conspicuously included the word \n\u201carguably\u201d in the test to indicate that the benefit of \nany doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u2019\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n130 (quoting Patchak, 567 U.S. at 225).  \n \nThe Court did exactly that in Bank of America \nCorp. v. City of Miami, which involved Fair Housing \nAct statute-specific judicial review provisions that \n\u201callow[] any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 to file a civil action \nseeking damages for a violation of the statute.\u201d  137   \nS. Ct.  at 1300.  Plaintiff City of Miami filed suit \nagainst two banks for allegedly violating the Act.  This \nCourt held that \u201cthe City\u2019s claimed injuries fall within \nthe zone of interests that the FHA arguably protects.\u201d  \nId. at 1301 (emphasis added). \n \nAs Justice Scalia recognized in Bennett, finding \nstatutory standing where a plaintiff\u2019s interests are at \nleast \u201carguably\u201d within a statute\u2019s zone of interests is \nappropriate because a plaintiff (or petitioner in a court \nof appeals) still must satisfy the \u201cimmutable \nrequirements of Article III,\u201d  520 U.S. at 162, which \nFDA apparently recognizes Respondents satisfy here.  \nThere is no principled reason why plaintiffs (or court \n\n17 \n \n \nof appeals petitioners) that invoke statute-specific \njudicial review provisions should be deprived of the \nsame broad view that is applied in challenges arising \nunder the APA.  For the reasons already discussed, the \nretailers\u2019 interests in challenging FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial are not merely arguably, but squarely, within \nthe TCA\u2019s zone of interests.  Holding that they have \nstatutory standing \u201crequires no guesswork.\u201d  Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 131.    \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying dismissal or \ntransfer should be affirmed. \n \n \n \n  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nLAWRENCE S.

          "task_beliefs": "My current understanding of this case, which was significantly reshaped by the Atlantic Legal Foundation (ALF) amicus brief, remains stable following the latest observation. The observation was an internal thought process, which serves to confirm my current state of analysis but does not introduce new external facts, legal arguments, or signals about the case's trajectory. Therefore, my beliefs about the merits and the likely outcome are unchanged.\n\nI continue to view this case as far more balanced than I did at the cert-stage. My initial belief in a likely reversal for the FDA has been tempered by the robust counter-arguments presented in support of the Respondents. The core tension remains between the FDA's argument about preventing forum shopping and the Respondents' argument about the plain meaning and structure of the statute.\n\nMy current, cumulative understanding of the key arguments is as follows:\n\n*   **The Respondents' Position (Strengthened by ALF):**\n    *   **Direct vs. Derivative Harm:** The most compelling point for the Respondents is that the FDA's denial order does not just cause indirect economic harm to retailers; it creates direct legal jeopardy. The order renders the products \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated,\" exposing retailers to federal enforcement actions, including criminal penalties, civil fines, and seizure. This recasts their injury as a primary legal consequence, making them directly \"adversely affected.\"\n    *   **Statutory Structure:** The argument that Congress knew how to limit judicial review to applicants\u2014and did so in other parts of the Tobacco Control Act (e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2))\u2014but chose the broader phrase \"any person adversely affected\" for marketing denial orders (\u00a7 387l(a)(1)) is a powerful canon of construction (expressio unius est exclusio alterius). This suggests the broad language was an intentional choice.\n    *   **Zone of Interests:** The ALF brief cleverly reframed the \"zone of interests\" to include retailers. By citing the FDA's own recognition of e-cigarettes as a harm-reduction tool for adult smokers, it argues that retailers who make these products available are serving a public health purpose contemplated by the statute, placing them within its protective zone.\n    *   **Systemic Administrative Law Concerns:** A narrow ruling for the FDA could have broad, destabilizing effects on judicial review across many other regulatory statutes that use the same \"any person adversely affected\" language. This \"parade of horribles\" presents the Court with a strong reason to avoid setting a restrictive precedent.\n\n*   **The Petitioner's (FDA) Position:**\n    *   **Term of Art & Statutory Context:** The FDA's core legal argument is that \"adversely affected\" is a term of art tied to the specific administrative process. In the context of a marketing application, only the applicant who submitted the materials and received the denial is the direct subject of the agency action.\n    *   **Institutional Need to Prevent Forum Shopping:** This remains the FDA's most powerful practical and institutional argument. The government will argue that allowing downstream retailers to sue creates \"magnet jurisdiction,\" enabling manufacturers to hand-pick favorable circuits by finding a single retailer within them. This undermines the orderly administration of justice and encourages strategic litigation. This argument likely resonates strongly with the Chief Justice and others concerned with the institutional integrity of the federal courts.\n\nThe recent internal monologue observation highlights a key area of my uncertainty: the landscape of amicus support for the FDA. While the Respondents' legal position has been significantly bolstered by the ALF brief, I have not yet observed any countervailing amicus briefs that might similarly strengthen the FDA's legal arguments beyond what was in their own filings. The presence (or absence) and quality of such briefs will be a critical signal. For now, my prediction is held in a state of greater balance, acknowledging that a decision affirming the Fifth Circuit is more plausible than I initially believed, while the FDA's practical arguments against forum shopping remain a potent force for reversal.",

I have inferred from this that the FDA's core statutory arguments are weak and isolated. This action\u2014reading the Petitioner's brief on the merits\u2014is the single most effective way to test that inference. The potential for a significant belief update is extremely high. If the brief presents new, powerful, or unexpectedly persuasive arguments, it could completely reset my understanding of the case, moving it from 'leaning Respondent' back to a toss-up or even 'leaning Petitioner'. Conversely, if it confirms my current assessment, it will dramatically increase my confidence in my prediction. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high.\n\nFor Design EIG, this action is a crucial test of my methodology. It pits an inference from secondary evidence (the amicus landscape) against primary evidence (the party's own arguments). The outcome will provide a critical data point on how much weight to give the presence or absence of amicus support as a proxy for argument strength. This is a fundamental strategic question in SCOTUS prediction, making the potential for design-level learning very high. This action is a foundational step in case analysis that I have not yet taken, and doing so now is essential for both the specific prediction and my general model.",

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \nOPINION BELOW \nThe order of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-8a) is \nunreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 2, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 1a-15a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \n\n2 \n \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA), to regulate tobacco products.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 393(d)(2).  The Act applies automatically to some \ntobacco products, such as cigarettes, but other products \nbecome subject to it only once FDA issues a rule that \n\u201cdeems\u201d the product \u201cto be subject to\u201d the Act.  21 \nU.S.C. 387a(b). \nAs relevant here, the Act restricts the marketing of \n\u201cnew tobacco product[s]\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products that \nwere not commercially marketed in the United States \nas of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A manu-\nfacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into in-\nterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization from \nFDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2).   \nA manufacturer seeking marketing authorization \nmust file an application with FDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(b).  \nAfter reviewing the application, FDA must issue either \nan \u201corder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \nan \u201corder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d \ninto interstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  The \nagency must deny an application unless the applicant \nshows that the product would be \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).   \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the denial in accordance with the Administrative \n\n3 \n \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \n2. This case involves the application of the Act to \nelectronic nicotine delivery systems, which are com-\nmonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes.  See Office of the \nSurgeon General, U.S. Public Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs., E-Cigarette Use Among \nYouth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon Gen-\neral 3 (2016).  An e-cigarette is a battery-powered device \nthat heats a nicotine solution, or \u201ce-liquid,\u201d converting \nthe solution into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user then inhales.  See id. at 11.   \nBecause Congress did not list e-cigarettes among the \nproducts to which the Act automatically applied, they \nwere not at first subject to regulation under the Act.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387a(b).  But in 2016, FDA issued a rule \ndeeming e-cigarettes and e-liquids to be subject to the \nAct.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, \n2016).  Because e-cigarettes had generally not been on \nthe market as of February 15, 2007, they are new to-\nbacco products under the Act, and FDA\u2019s deeming rule \nmeant that they could lawfully be marketed only after \nreceiving agency authorization.  See Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, \n144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \nIn 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy regard-\ning certain e-cigarettes.  See Center for Tobacco Prods., \nFDA, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., Enforce-\nment Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Sys-\ntems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Mar-\nket Without Premarket Authorization (Revised) (Apr. \n2020).  FDA stated that it intended to prioritize enforce-\nment action against certain categories of products: cer-\ntain flavored products, products for which the manufac-\n\n4 \n \nturer failed to take adequate measures to prevent mi-\nnors\u2019 access, products targeted to minors, and products \nfor which the manufacturer failed to submit an applica-\ntion by September 9, 2020.  See id. at 3.  For other e-\ncigarettes, FDA stated that it would \u201cexercise enforce-\nment discretion for up to one year pending FDA review, \nunless there is a negative action by FDA on such appli-\ncation.\u201d  Id. at 27.  FDA warned, however, that its guid-\nance \u201cdoes not in any way alter the fact that it is illegal \nto market any new tobacco product without premarket \nauthorization.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products.  See Pet. App. 13a.  \nReynolds is incorporated, and thus resides, in North \nCarolina, and it maintains its principal place of business \nin Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds \nVapor Co., Business Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. \n2022, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023). \nReynolds applied for authorization to market berry- \nand menthol-flavored e-cigarette products under the \nbrand name Vuse Alto.  See Pet. App. 3a.  FDA denied \nthe applications, finding that Reynolds had failed to \nshow that the products would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.  See id. at 9a-23a.   \n2. Reynolds sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n3a.  Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a petition \nfor review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See id. at 7a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting).  But those courts had already rejected the \nprincipal legal theory on which Reynolds relies here.  \nSee ibid.  Specifically, Reynolds claims that FDA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously by changing the evidentiary \nstandards for flavored e-cigarette products after manu-\n\n5 \n \nfacturers had submitted their applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The Fourth and D.C. Circuits previously re-\njected similar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 \n(4th Cir.); Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022). \nReynolds sought judicial review in the Fifth Circuit \ninstead.  See Pet. App. 3a.  A panel of that court had \nrejected a claim similar to that brought by Reynolds, \nsee Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, \n41 F.4th 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2022), but by the time Reyn-\nolds filed its petition for review, the court had vacated \nthat decision and granted rehearing en banc, see Wages \n& White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  The en banc court would eventually rule \nin favor of the e-cigarette manufacturers.  See Wages & \nWhite Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FD\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n11: 20241113173008975_CERTIFICATE2023-118720FOOD20AND20DRUG20ADMIN.json (score: 0.455)\nNo.  23-1187 \n   \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES  \n  \n  \n _________________  \n \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ET AL., PETITIONERS \nv.  \nR.J.

L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, re-\nquires a person to obtain authorization from the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) before introducing a \nnew tobacco product into interstate commerce.  If FDA \ndenies an application for authorization, \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected by such  * * *  denial may file a petition \nfor judicial review of such  * * *  denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The \nquestion presented is:  \nWhether a manufacturer may file a petition for re-\nview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it \nneither resides nor has its principal place of business, if \nthe petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts that is located within that circuit. \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 1 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 4 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nA retailer may not file a petition for review of an \nFDA order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nfor marketing authorization ......................................... 11 \n1.

App. 1a-8a) is \nunreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 2, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 1a-15a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \n\n2 \n \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA), to regulate tobacco products.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 393(d)(2).  The Act applies automatically to some \ntobacco products, such as cigarettes, but other products \nbecome subject to it only once FDA issues a rule that \n\u201cdeems\u201d the product \u201cto be subject to\u201d the Act.  21 \nU.S.C. 387a(b). \nAs relevant here, the Act restricts the marketing of \n\u201cnew tobacco product[s]\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products that \nwere not commercially marketed in the United States \nas of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A manu-\nfacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into in-\nterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization from \nFDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2).   \nA manufacturer seeking marketing authorization \nmust file an application with FDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(b).  \nAfter reviewing the application, FDA must issue either \nan \u201corder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \nan \u201corder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d \ninto interstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  The \nagency must deny an application unless the applicant \nshows that the product would be \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).   \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the denial in accordance with the Administrative \n\n3 \n \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \n2. This case involves the application of the Act to \nelectronic nicotine delivery systems, which are com-\nmonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes.  See Office of the \nSurgeon General, U.S. Public Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs., E-Cigarette Use Among \nYouth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon Gen-\neral 3 (2016).  An e-cigarette is a battery-powered device \nthat heats a nicotine solution, or \u201ce-liquid,\u201d converting \nthe solution into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user then inhales.  See id. at 11.   \nBecause Congress did not list e-cigarettes among the \nproducts to which the Act automatically applied, they \nwere not at first subject to regulation under the Act.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387a(b).  But in 2016, FDA issued a rule \ndeeming e-cigarettes and e-liquids to be subject to the \nAct.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, \n2016).  Because e-cigarettes had generally not been on \nthe market as of February 15, 2007, they are new to-\nbacco products under the Act, and FDA\u2019s deeming rule \nmeant that they could lawfully be marketed only after \nreceiving agency authorization.  See Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, \n144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \nIn 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy regard-\ning certain e-cigarettes.  See Center for Tobacco Prods., \nFDA, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., Enforce-\nment Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Sys-\ntems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Mar-\nket Without Premarket Authorization (Revised) (Apr. \n2020).  FDA stated that it intended to prioritize enforce-\nment action against certain categories of products: cer-\ntain flavored products, products for which the manufac-\n\n4 \n \nturer failed to take adequate measures to prevent mi-\nnors\u2019 access, products targeted to minors, and products \nfor which the manufacturer failed to submit an applica-\ntion by September 9, 2020.  See id. at 3.  For other e-\ncigarettes, FDA stated that it would \u201cexercise enforce-\nment discretion for up to one year pending FDA review, \nunless there is a negative action by FDA on such appli-\ncation.\u201d  Id. at 27.  FDA warned, however, that its guid-\nance \u201cdoes not in any way alter the fact that it is illegal \nto market any new tobacco product without premarket \nauthorization.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products.  See Pet. App. 13a.  \nReynolds is incorporated, and thus resides, in North \nCarolina, and it maintains its principal place of business \nin Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds \nVapor Co., Business Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. \n2022, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023). \nReynolds applied for authorization to market berry- \nand menthol-flavored e-cigarette products under the \nbrand name Vuse Alto.  See Pet. App. 3a.  FDA denied \nthe applications, finding that Reynolds had failed to \nshow that the products would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.  See id. at 9a-23a.   \n2. Reynolds sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n3a.  Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a petition \nfor review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See id. at 7a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting).  But those courts had already rejected the \nprincipal legal theory on which Reynolds relies here.  \nSee ibid.  Specifically, Reynolds claims that FDA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously by changing the evidentiary \nstandards for flavored e-cigarette products after manu-\n\n5 \n \nfacturers had submitted their applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The Fourth and D.C. Circuits previously re-\njected similar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 \n(4th Cir.); Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022). \nReynolds sought judicial review in the Fifth Circuit \ninstead.  See Pet. App. 3a.  A panel of that court had \nrejected a claim similar to that brought by Reynolds, \nsee Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, \n41 F.4th 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2022), but by the time Reyn-\nolds filed its petition for review, the court had vacated \nthat decision and granted rehearing en banc, see Wages \n& White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  The en banc court would eventually rule \nin favor of the e-cigarette manufacturers.  See Wages & \nWhite Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n386 (5th Cir. 2024), cert. granted, No. 23-1038 (oral ar-\ngument scheduled for Dec. 2, 2024). \nThree other entities joined Reynolds\u2019 Fifth Circuit \npetition: RJR Vapor Co., LLC; Avail Vapor Texas, \nLLC; and the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and \nConvenience Stores Association.  See C.A. Pet. for Re-\nview 1-4 (Oct. 12, 2023).  The first entity (a corporate af-\nfiliate of Reynolds) is based in North Carolina and sells \nVuse Alto products online.  See Pet. 5.  The second en-\ntity is a Texas company that runs a retail store that sells \nVuse Alto products.  See C.A. Pet. for Review 3.  The \nthird entity is a Mississippi trade association of gas sta-\ntions and convenience stores, which has members that \nsell Vuse Alto products.  See ibid.   \nReynolds and the other three entities (respondents \nin this Court) alleged that Avail and the Association\u2019s \nmembers \u201cwill no longer be able to sell\u201d Vuse products \n\n6 \n \nand \u201cwill have to dispose of [their] existing inventory\u201d \nnow that FDA has denied Reynolds\u2019 application.  C.A. \nPet. for Review 3.  Respondents argued that venue lies \nin the Fifth Circuit because Avail and the Association \nare both based there.  See ibid.  \u201cOut of an abundance \nof caution,\u201d however, respondents later filed a \u201cprotec-\ntive petition\u201d in the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. for Review at 3, \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-1298 (Oct. 27, \n2023).   \n3. FDA moved to dismiss the petition for review or \nto transfer it to the D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit.  \nSee C.A. Doc. 43, at 23 (Oct. 18, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit \ndenied the motion in an unpublished order.  See Pet. \nApp. 1a-8a.   \nThe Fifth Circuit had previously held, in considering \nanother petition for review filed by Reynolds and joined \nby the remaining respondents, that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit.\u201d  Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 188.  In the decision \nbelow, the court stated that it was bound by that hold-\ning.  See Pet. App. 4a.  Elaborating on the earlier deci-\nsion\u2019s reasoning, the court stated that, because the To-\nbacco Control Act allows \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d to challenge the denial of an application for mar-\nketing authorization, e-cigarette sellers may \u201cchallenge \nFDA decisions that affect them.\u201d  Ibid. (citation and em-\nphasis omitted).  The court also concluded that, because \n\u201ctwo of the [four] Petitioners\u201d \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business here in the Fifth Circuit,\u201d all four \ncould file a petition for review there.  Id. at 3a.  \nJudge Higginson dissented.  See Pet. App. 6a-8a.  He \nobserved that the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of the \nAct effectively nullifies its venue limitations.  See id. at \n6a-7a.  He also stated that the court\u2019s \u201cexpansive read-\n\n7 \n \ning of venue cannot seem to be reconciled with the other \nprovisions of the [Act].\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn a separate order, the court of appeals granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion to stay FDA\u2019s denial order pending \nresolution of the petition for review.  See C.A. Doc. 133, \nat 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  Judge Higginson dissented from \nthat order as well.  See id. at 3 n.*.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a retailer may \nchallenge the denial of a manufacturer\u2019s application.  It \nerred again in holding that the out-of-circuit manufac-\nturer may ride the local retailer\u2019s coattails to establish \nvenue.  The combination of those errors deprives the \nTobacco Control Act\u2019s venue restrictions of meaningful \neffect.  \nA.  Under the Tobacco Control Act, an \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d person may seek judicial review of an FDA or-\nder denying an application for marketing authorization.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \u201cAdversely affected\u201d is a term of \nart in administrative law.  It invokes the zone-of-interests \ntest, under which an entity may seek judicial review \nonly if the interest it asserts falls within the zone of in-\nterests protected by the statutory provision at issue.  \nA retailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the provision at issue\u2014the provision that \nrequires FDA to adjudicate an application for market-\ning authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(c).  The order that \nFDA issues at the end of that adjudication speaks to the \napplicant alone (always or nearly always a manufac-\nturer of the product) and affects retailers only indi-\nrectly.  And while the provision grants procedural \nrights to the applicant itself, it shows no similar solici-\ntude for retailers.  It does not allow retailers to partici-\npate in the proceedings, does not grant them any proce-\n\n8 \n \ndural rights, and does not require FDA to account for \ntheir substantive interests.   \nThe statute\u2019s structure confirms that non-applicant \nretailers lack the right to challenge denial orders.  The \nAct contains a confidentiality provision that shields \ntrade secrets and other sensitive information submitted \nas part of the application process.  Because of that pro-\nvision, retailers will not necessarily know that a manu-\nfacturer has filed an application or that the agency has \ndenied it.  Congress would not have granted retailers \nthe right to challenge denial orders in court while deny-\ning them the right to know that such orders had been \nentered and the right to see the information necessary \nto mount an effective challenge to FDA\u2019s conclusion \nthat the applicant failed to show that the product at issue \nwould be appropriate for the protection of public health.  \nThe Act, moreover, forbids the sale of a new tobacco \nproduct unless and until FDA authorizes the marketing \nof the product.  An order denying a manufacturer\u2019s ap-\nplication thus leaves a retailer\u2019s legal rights unchanged:  \nThe retailer has no right to sell the product before the \ndenial, and it still lacks that right after the denial.  The \nretailers in this case unlawfully sold Reynolds\u2019 Vuse \nAlto products before FDA had acted on Reynolds\u2019 ap-\nplications, but their unlawful conduct cannot generate a \nright to judicial review that they would otherwise lack. \nB.  The Fifth Circuit also erred in holding that an \nout-of-circuit manufacturer may join a local retailer \nwho seeks judicial review in the circuit.  The Act pro-\nvides that a person may file a petition for review in a \ncircuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) only if \u201csuch per-\nson\u201d resides or has its principal place of business there.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The text thus makes clear that a \nperson may sue in a circuit only if that person is based \n\n9 \n \nthere.  A manufacturer may not sue based on a retailer\u2019s \nresidence.  \nTraditional principles of joinder confirm that read-\ning.  Joinder is a procedural device that enables suits \nthat could have been brought separately to be brought \nand processed together, not a tool for expanding the \nparties\u2019 rights or the court\u2019s power.  Because Reynolds \nhad no right to file its own petition in the Fifth Circuit, \nit also had no right to join someone else\u2019s petition there.  \nThe same result follows from traditional principles \nof venue.  This Court has long held that, except when \nCongress provides otherwise, venue must be proper as \nto each party in a multi-party case.  \u201c[E]ach plaintiff \nmust be competent to sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant must be \nliable to be sued\u201d in the chosen forum.  Smith v. Lyon, \n133 U.S. 315, 319 (1890).  Nothing in the language of the \nAct departs from that default rule.  \nC.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation deprives the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions of meaningful effect and ena-\nbles their ready evasion.  Congress specified three ven-\nues where a person may sue.  But under the decision \nbelow, an applicant may sue in any regional circuit any-\nwhere in the country so long as it finds a local retailer \nwilling to join its petition.  This Court should not adopt \nsuch a self-defeating interpretation of the statute.   \nARGUMENT \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides as follows:  \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A)  the promulgation of a regulation under [21 \nU.S.C. 387g] establishing, amending, or revoking \na tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B)  a denial of an application under [21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)], \n\n10 \n \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That provision allows a person to \nfile a petition for review of an FDA denial order in one \nof three circuits: the D.C. Circuit, the circuit where it \nresides, or the circuit where it maintains its principal \nplace of business.  When, as here, a venue statute does \nnot define what counts as a residence, this Court usually \nholds that a domestic corporation resides in the State of \nits incorporation.  See, e.g., TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft \nFoods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 262 (2017); \nShaw v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U.S. 444, 449 (1892).  \nThe Fifth Circuit, however, has read the Tobacco \nControl Act\u2019s venue provision to mean that a manufac-\nturer that neither resides nor maintains its principal \nplace of business in the circuit may nonetheless file a \npetition for review there, so long as the petition is joined \nby a local seller of the manufacturer\u2019s products.  See \nPet. App. 3a.  Reynolds, a manufacturer based in the \nFourth Circuit, has invoked that theory to file three pe-\ntitions for review, including the petition at issue here, in \nthe Fifth Circuit.1  At least eight other out-of-circuit \nmanufacturers\u2014based in China, California, Florida, \nMichigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington\u2014\n \n1  See p. 5, supra; Pet. for Review at 3, R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. \nFDA, No. 23-60037 (5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023); Pet. for Review at 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023).   \n\n11 \n \nhave since relied on the same tactic to seek judicial re-\nview in the Fifth Circuit.2   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of the Act rests on two \nindependent errors.  First, the court erred in holding \nthat a retail seller may seek judicial review of an FDA \norder denying a manufacturer\u2019s application.  Second, \nthe court erred in holding that venue need be proper \nonly as to one party, rather than all the parties.  Those \ntwo errors, in combination, effectively nullify the Act\u2019s \nlimits on venue.  This Court should reverse the court of \nappeals\u2019 order and remand with instructions to transfer \nthe case to the D.C. Circuit.  See C.A. Doc. 80, at 38 (Oct. \n30, 2023) (stating that respondents prefer the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to the Fourth Circuit).  \nA. A Retailer May Not File A Petition For Review Of An \nFDA Order Denying A Manufacturer\u2019s Application For \nMarketing Authorization \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides that an \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d person may seek judicial review of an FDA or-\nder denying an application for marketing authorization.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).

Newport \nNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 \n(1995).  The APA authorizes judicial review at the behest \nof an \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d person.  5 U.S.C. \n702.  Many agency-specific statutes likewise use the \nterms \u201cadversely affected\u201d and \u201caggrieved,\u201d alone or in \ncombination, to designate those who may challenge \nagency action.  See Newport News, 514 U.S. at 126. \nThe terms \u201cadversely affected\u201d and \u201caggrieved\u201d in-\nvoke the zone-of-interests test.  See, e.g., Thompson v. \nNorth American Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011); \nLujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, \n886 (1990).  Under that test, a plaintiff may seek judicial \nreview only if its interests \u201cfall within the zone of inter-\nests protected by the law invoked.\u201d  Lexmark Interna-\ntional, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. \n118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted).   \n\u201c[T]he breadth of the zone of interests varies accord-\ning to the provisions of law at issue.\u201d  Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997); see Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n126 (\u201c[W]hat constitutes adverse effect or aggrieve-\nment varies from statute to statute.\u201d) (citation and em-\nphasis omitted).  In APA cases, the zone-of-interests \ntest is not \u201cespecially demanding.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. \nat 130 (citation omitted).  In that context, the Court has \n\u201cconspicuously included the word \u2018arguably\u2019 in the test \nto indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the \nplaintiff.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  That \u201clenient ap-\nproach\u201d preserves \u201cthe flexibility of the APA\u2019s omnibus \njudicial-review provision, which permits suits for viola-\ntions of numerous statutes of varying character.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThat lenient approach does not, however, carry over \nto other statutes.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  In \n\n13 \n \nnon-APA cases, a court should generally ask whether \nthe interest asserted by the plaintiff actually (rather \nthan just arguably) falls within the zone protected by \nthe statute.  See id. at 129.  As a result, \u201cwhat comes \nwithin the zone of interests  * * *  for purposes of  * * *  \nthe \u2018generous review provisions\u2019 of the APA may not do \nso for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163 (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA court should discern the breadth of the zone of  \ninterests\u2014or, said otherwise, identify the types of \nharms that qualify as adverse effects\u2014using the normal \ntools of statutory interpretation, including text, struc-\nture, and precedent.  See Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n127-136.  In this case, those tools show that a retailer \nmay not challenge an order denying a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for marketing authorization.   \n1. A retailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue \nIn applying the zone-of-interests test, a court should \nfocus on \u201cthe particular provision of law upon which the \nplaintiff relies,\u201d not on the \u201coverall purpose of the Act.\u201d  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 175-176.  The plaintiff must show \nthat its interest falls within the zone protected by \u201cthe \nstatutory provision whose violation forms the legal ba-\nsis for [the] complaint.\u201d  National Wildlife Federation, \n497 U.S. at 883.  Applying the test at a higher \u201clevel of \ngenerality\u201d risks depriving it \u201cof virtually all meaning.\u201d  \nAir Courier Conference of America v. American Postal \nWorkers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 529-530 (1991).   \nRespondents claim that FDA acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously in applying 21 U.S.C. 387j(c), the provision \nof the Tobacco Control Act directing the agency to act \non applications for marketing authorization.  See pp. 4-\n5, supra.  The judicial-review provision that they invoke \n\n14 \n \nauthorizes courts to review \u201ca denial of an application \nunder section 387j(c) of this title.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B) \n(emphasis added).  Respondents must therefore show \nthat Section 387j(c) protects not only the interests of the \napplicant itself, but also the interests of retail sellers of \nthe applicant\u2019s products.  Respondents cannot make \nthat showing.   \na. Section 387j(c) directs FDA to issue an \u201corder\u201d \nafter adjudicating an application.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A); \nsee 5 U.S.C. 551(6) (APA\u2019s definition of \u201corder\u201d).  Con-\ngress modeled administrative adjudications on court \nproceedings.  See Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 110 (2000).  \nLike a court order, an agency order ordinarily ad-\ndresses particular parties, not the \u201cworld at large.\u201d   \nRadiofone, Inc. v. FCC, 759 F.2d 936, 938 (D.C. Cir. \n1985) (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Under Section 387j(c), after \nevaluating an application, FDA must issue either \u201can \norder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \u201can \norder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d into \ninterstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  That or-\nder is issued to the applicant alone.  Because the order \nregulates only the applicant, the prohibition upon arbi-\ntrary and capricious decision-making in the issuance of \nthe order seeks to protect only the applicant.  It does \nnot seek to protect retailers, who are strangers to the \nadjudication. \nTo be sure, denial orders may have indirect conse-\nquences for retailers:  If a manufacturer lacks authori-\nzation to sell a product, retailers cannot lawfully obtain \nand resell it.  But that indirect effect does not entitle \nretailers to judicial review of FDA\u2019s decision on a man-\nufacturer\u2019s application.  Our legal system has long dis-\ntinguished between \u201caction that directly affects a citi-\nzen\u2019s legal rights\u201d and \u201caction that is directed against a \n\n15 \n \nthird party and affects the citizen only indirectly or in-\ncidentally.\u201d  O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, \n447 U.S. 773, 788 (1980); see Department of State v. \nMu\u00f1oz, 602 U.S. 899, 917-919 (2024); Legal Tender \nCases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871).  When agency action \u201cdi-\nrectly affects\u201d one person and \u201ccauses only a conse-\nquential detriment\u201d to a bystander, the bystander has a \nweak claim to judicial review\u2014especially when (as here) \nits interests can be \u201cadequately protected by the person \ndirectly affected.\u201d  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Commit-\ntee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 153-154 (1951) (Frankfur-\nter, J., concurring).  Indeed, a claim based on a \u201cderiv-\native\u201d harm is \u201cprecisely the sort of claim that the pru-\ndential standing doctrine\u201d (as the zone-of-interests test \nis sometimes known) \u201cis designed to foreclose.\u201d  Center \nfor Reproductive Law & Policy v. Bush, 304 F.3d 183, \n196 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J.). \nThis case, in addition, differs meaningfully from \ncases where this Court has held that a bystander may \nchallenge an agency order.  Although the Act provides \nfor review only of denials of applications, see 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1)(B), some other statutes authorize adversely \naffected or aggrieved persons to seek review of both \ngrants and denials of applications, see, e.g., 47 U.S.C. \n402(b)(6).  Such statutes may even allow \u201cpersons with \ninterests adverse to the winning party,\u201d such as \u201ccom-\npetitors,\u201d to challenge an agency order granting an ap-\nplication.  Radiofone, 759 F.2d at 939 (opinion of Scalia, \nJ.); see, e.g., FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, \n309 U.S. 470, 476-477 (1940).  Unlike competitors, how-\never, the retailers here are not adverse to the manufac-\nturer.  Their interests, rather, derive from the manufac-\nturer\u2019s and are \u201cadequately protected\u201d by the manufac-\nturer\u2019s own ability to seek review of the denial of its ap-\n\n16 \n \nplication.  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, 341 \nU.S. at 154 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  \nb. The rest of Section 387j\u2014the section establishing \nthe process for applying for marketing authorization\u2014\nconfirms that Section 387j(c) does not seek to protect \nretailers.  Section 387j authorizes an applicant to file an \napplication with FDA, see 21 U.S.C. 387j(b), and then \ndirects FDA to issue a decision after considering \u201cthe \ninformation submitted to [it] as part of the application,\u201d \n21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2).  Section 387j does not give retailers \nany role in that process.  It does not authorize them to \nintervene, to submit additional evidence, or to comment \non the agency\u2019s proposed action.   \nSection 387j also confers various procedural rights \nupon the applicant alone.  For example, \u201can applicant\u201d \nmay ask FDA to refer the application to a special scien-\ntific committee.  21 U.S.C. 387j(b)(2)(B).  FDA must \nserve its order on \u201cthe applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(e)(2).  \nAnd if FDA denies an application, it must, to the extent \npracticable, provide a \u201cstatement informing the appli-\ncant of the measures required to remove such applica-\ntion from deniable form\u201d\u2014measures that may include \n\u201cfurther research by the applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(3).  \nSection 387j, by contrast, grants no procedural rights to \nretailers.  Retailers have no right to make requests \nabout the processing of the application, no right to no-\ntice of the agency\u2019s order, no right to know the reasons \nfor a denial, and no right to know what changes could be \nmade to make the application grantable.  \nThe substantive standard that Section 387j requires \nFDA to apply likewise reveals no concern for retailers\u2019 \nparticular interests.  The agency may authorize the \nmarketing of a new tobacco product only if the applicant \nshows that authorization would be \u201cappropriate for the \n\n17 \n \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).  \nThe Act requires the agency, in applying that test, to \nweigh (1) the likelihood that the new product will help \nexisting smokers \u201cstop using\u201d tobacco products and  \n(2) the risk that the new product will prompt non- \nsmokers to \u201cstart using\u201d tobacco products.  21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)(4).  But the Act does not direct the agency to \nweigh any interests of potential retailers, such as the \nnew product\u2019s effects on their revenues.  \nIn sum, Section 387j requires FDA to issue an order \ndirected to the applicant, not to retailers.  It does not \ngive retailers a role in the agency process, does not \ngrant them any procedural protections, and does not re-\nquire the agency to consider their substantive interests.  \nIn fact, Section 387j does not mention retailers at all.  \nThe statutory text and context thus strongly suggest \nthat retailers\u2019 interests fall outside the zone of interests \nthat Section 387j(c) protects.  \nc. The contrary reading of the Act lacks an obvious \nstopping point.  This case involves retailers that have \npreviously sold the product at issue, but respondents\u2019 \nreasoning would seem to extend even further.  Taken to \nits logical conclusion, it would permit judicial review at \nthe behest of a retailer that has never sold the product \nbut would like to do so once the product is authorized.  \nIt would also permit review at the behest of a consumer \nwho uses the product\u2014or, for that matter, a consumer \nwho does not yet use it but would like to do so.  A court \nshould not lightly infer that an agency order directed to \na specific applicant may be challenged by such a broad \nclass of bystanders.  \nThe contrary reading would also allow a retailer (and \nperhaps a consumer) to file a petition for review without \nregard to the wishes of the unsuccessful applicant.  A \n\n18 \n \nretailer could seek judicial review even if the applicant \nprefers to drop the case (e.g., in favor of filing a new \napplication).  Or a retailer could insist on litigating in \none circuit even if the applicant prefers another one \nwhere it is permitted to file.  Allowing retailers and \nother bystanders to file their own challenges would thus \nundermine \u201cthe autonomy of those persons likely to be \nmost directly affected by [the agency\u2019s] order.\u201d  Valley \nForge Christian College v. Americans United for Sepa-\nration of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982). \n2. The structure of the statutory scheme confirms that \na retailer may not challenge an FDA order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application \nA court should always seek to interpret a statute \u201cas \na symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\u201d and to \n\u201cfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.\u201d  \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. \n120, 133 (2000) (citations omitted); see Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law 167 (2012).  Statutory \nstructure is especially relevant to the interpretation of \nthe term \u201cadversely affected.\u201d  Discerning which harms \nconstitute adverse effects often involves inferences \ndrawn from the nature of the \u201cstatutory scheme.\u201d  New-\nport News, 514 U.S. at 127 (citation omitted).  Here, sev-\neral features of the statutory framework confirm that a \nretailer lacks the right to challenge the denial of a man-\nufacturer\u2019s application.  \na. The Tobacco Control Act includes a provision that \nprotects \u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d \u201ctrade secrets and \ncommercial or financial information\u201d submitted by an \napplicant as part of the application process.  5 U.S.C. \n552(b)(4); see 21 U.S.C. 387f(c) (cross-referencing 5 \nU.S.C. 552(b)(4)).  The Act provides that such infor-\nmation \u201cshall be considered confidential and shall not \n\n19 \n \nbe disclosed,\u201d except in specified circumstances.  21 \nU.S.C. 387f(c).   \nBecause of the confidentiality provision, retailers \nand other members of the public will not necessarily \nknow that a manufacturer has applied for authorization \nto market a new tobacco product.  \u201c[T]he intent to mar-\nket a tobacco product that is not currently marketed is \noften considered confidential commercial information.\u201d  \n86 Fed. Reg. 55,300, 55,398 (Oct. 5, 2021).  FDA thus \ngenerally \u201cwill not publicly disclose the existence of an \napplication.\u201d  21 C.F.R. 1114.47(b)(1).   \nRetailers and other members of the public likewise \nwill not necessarily know that FDA has denied a partic-\nular manufacturer\u2019s application or what particular \nproduct was subject to agency adjudication.  \u201cEven af-\nter receipt of a marketing denial order,\u201d \u201cthe intent to \nmarket may still constitute confidential commercial in-\nformation.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. at 55,398.  When FDA denies \nan application, therefore, it limits public disclosures to \nnon-confidential information, such as the \u201ctobacco prod-\nuct category (e.g., cigarette),\u201d the \u201ctobacco product sub-\ncategory (e.g., filtered, combusted cigarette),\u201d and the \n\u201ccharacterizing flavor.\u201d  21 C.F.R. 1114.47(d).  Unless \nthe manufacturer has disclosed its intent to market the \nproduct, the agency does not identify the specific prod-\nuct for which marketing authorization was denied.  \nEven when the public knows that a manufacturer has \napplied for marketing authorization and that FDA has \ndenied the application, the confidentiality provision pre-\ncludes full disclosure of the contents of the application, \ndenial order, and agency record.  Here, for example, \nReynolds successfully moved to seal its filings in the \ncourt of appeals in order to protect \u201cconfidential and \nproprietary information concerning Vuse products\u2019 de-\n\n20 \n \nsign, components, and other highly sensitive technical \ndetails that have not been made available to the public.\u201d  \nC.A. Doc. 59, at 3.  It observed that \u201cFDA has repeat-\nedly recognized the need to prevent public disclosure of \nconfidential and sensitive information contained in sub-\nmissions like the Vuse applications.\u201d  Id. at 9. \nThe confidentiality provision reinforces retailers\u2019 \nlack of any right to seek judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n7a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  A person can seek judi-\ncial review only if it knows that a manufacturer has filed \nan application and that FDA has denied it.  There is no \nreason to think that Congress wanted a non-applicant \nretailer to be able to obtain judicial review if it could \nsomehow learn the non-public fact that an application \nhad been filed by someone else and had been denied in \nthe 30 days preceding the retailer\u2019s petition for review.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B). \nA person, moreover, can \u201cmake a considered decision \nwhether to seek judicial review\u201d only if it knows the \nagency\u2019s \u201creasons for the denial.\u201d  T-Mobile South, LLC \nv. City of Roswell, 574 U.S. 293, 304 (2015).  That is par-\nticularly true under the Tobacco Control Act, which in-\nstructs courts to review denials under the arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(b) (citing 5 \nU.S.C. 706(2)(A)).  It is implausible that Congress granted \nretailers a right to litigate record-intensive arbitrary-\nand-capricious challenges while denying them the right \nto see the administrative record.   \nb. The Tobacco Control Act\u2019s separate provisions \ngoverning sales of tobacco products support the conclu-\nsion that denial orders do not adversely affect retailers.  \nThose provisions make it unlawful to sell a new tobacco \nproduct unless and until FDA authorizes its marketing.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 331(c), 387b(6)(A).  Given those provi-\n\n21 \n \nsions, an order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nhas no effect on a retailer\u2019s legal rights or duties.  The \nretailer has no legal right to sell the unauthorized prod-\nuct before the denial order, and it still lacks that right \nafter the order.  Because a denial order leaves the re-\ntailer\u2019s legal position unchanged, the order does not \n\u201cadversely affect\u201d the retailer. \nA denial order, at most, affects a retailer\u2019s expecta-\ntions about the likelihood of FDA enforcement action.  \nUnder the enforcement policy in effect when Reynolds \nsubmitted its applications, FDA\u2019s enforcement priori-\nties included products for which marketing applications \nhad been denied.  See p. 4, supra.  But an increase in \nthe likelihood that FDA will enforce the law is not an \n\u201cadverse effect.\u201d  The scope of the term \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d depends on the statute\u2019s meaning when enacted, \nnot on FDA\u2019s post-enactment enforcement choices.  \nTreating a change in the odds of enforcement as a judi-\ncially cognizable harm would undermine the Executive \nBranch\u2019s exclusive Article II power to decide \u201chow to \nprioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions \nagainst defendants who violate the law.\u201d  United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 678 (2023) (citation omitted).   \nIn this case, the retailers explain that they have been \nselling Reynolds\u2019 Vuse Alto products since before FDA \nresolved Reynolds\u2019 applications.  See C.A. Pet. for Re-\nview 3.  They fear that, now that FDA has denied the \napplications, it will enforce the Act against them, so that \nthey \u201cwill no longer be able to sell\u201d the products.  Ibid.  \nBut those sales have violated the Act all along (even if \nthey were not identified as priorities for FDA enforce-\nment), and an interest in continuing to violate the law \nnecessarily falls outside the zone of interests that the \nlaw seeks to protect.  A retailer that has started unlaw-\n\n22 \n \nfully selling an unauthorized product may not seek ju-\ndicial review on the ground that a denial order reduces \nthe chances that FDA will continue to refrain from tak-\ning action against those violations.  Respondents\u2019 con-\ntrary argument runs up against \u201cthe basic notion that \nno court will lend its aid to one who founds a cause of \naction upon an  * * *  illegal act.\u201d  Paperworkers v. \nMisco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42 (1987); see Holman v. John-\nson, 98 Eng. Rep. 1120, 1121 (K.B. 1775) (Lord Mans-\nfield, L.C.J.) (\u201cIf, from the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s own stating or oth-\nerwise, the cause of action appears to arise  * * *  [from] \nthe transgression of a positive law of this country, there \nthe Court says he has no right to be assisted.\u201d).   \nc. Finally, the Act empowers FDA to withdraw a \ngrant of marketing authorization in some circumstances \n\u2014for instance, if it finds that \u201cthe continued marketing \nof [the] tobacco product no longer is appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(1)(A).  \nThe Act provides that the \u201cholder of an application\u201d \nmay obtain review of a withdrawal order \u201cin accordance \nwith section 387l,\u201d the judicial-review provision at issue \nhere.  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2).  \nThe statutory text makes plain, and respondents \nagree (Br. in Opp. 11), that the Act does not allow a re-\ntailer to challenge an order withdrawing authorization.  \nBut a withdrawal order, which forces a retailer to stop \npreviously lawful sales, affects a retailer\u2019s interests far \nmore directly than a denial order.  See Pet. App. 7a \n(Higginson, J., dissenting).  Respondents have prof-\nfered no persuasive reason why Congress would have \nwanted to allow retailers to challenge the denial of au-\nthorization to market a new tobacco product at the out-\nset, but not to challenge the agency\u2019s withdrawal of a \nprevious authorization.   \n\n23 \n \nReinforcing that point, Congress required FDA to \nfollow more robust procedures when issuing withdrawal \norders than when issuing denial orders.  Before the \nagency issues a withdrawal order, it must provide the \napplicant with a hearing, see 21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(1), in \nwhich the applicant enjoys specified procedural rights, \nsee 21 U.S.C. 321(x).  It would have been strange for \nCongress to conclude that granting additional proce-\ndural rights to the applicant somehow compensated for \ndenying judicial review to entities other than the appli-\ncant.   \n3. Precedent confirms that retailers lack the right to \nseek judicial review  \nThe interpretive issue presented in this case closely \nresembles the interpretive issue resolved in Block v. \nCommunity Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984).  \nThe statute in Block empowered an agency to issue \nmarket orders setting minimum prices to be paid by \nmilk handlers to milk producers.  See id. at 341-342.  It \nauthorized handlers to seek judicial review of market \norders, but only after exhausting administrative reme-\ndies.  See id. at 346.  A handler tried to bypass that ex-\nhaustion requirement by joining a group of milk con-\nsumers to challenge a market order under the APA.  \nSee id. at 344-345.  \nThe D.C. Circuit held that the consumers could sue, \nbut then-Judge Scalia dissented from that aspect of its \ndecision.  See Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, \n698 F.2d 1239, 1256-1258 (1983) (Scalia, J., concurring \nin part and dissenting in part), rev\u2019d, 467 U.S. 340 \n(1984).  Judge Scalia emphasized that the market orders \nhad a \u201cdirect and immediate\u201d effect on handlers, but \nonly an \u201cindirect\u201d effect on consumers.  Id. at 1257.  He \nreasoned that, because the \u201cimmediately affected\u201d group \n\n24 \n \n(handlers) was \u201creadily identifiable\u201d and could be \u201cre-\nlied upon to challenge agency disregard of the law,\u201d the \n\u201cmore remote\u201d group (consumers) could not be \u201cfound \nto meet the zone of interests test.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThis Court agreed with Judge Scalia that consumers \nlacked the right to challenge milk market orders.  See \nBlock, 467 U.S. at 346-348.  The Court emphasized that, \nalthough the statute authorized handlers \u201cto participate \nin the adoption and retention of market orders,\u201d it con-\ntained no \u201cexpress provision for participation by con-\nsumers.\u201d  Id. at 346-347.  The Court inferred that, be-\ncause Congress had excluded consumers from the \u201creg-\nulatory process,\u201d it \u201cintended a similar restriction of ju-\ndicial review.\u201d  Id. at 347.  The Court added that allow-\ning consumer suits \u201cwould provide handlers with a con-\nvenient device for evading the statutory [exhaustion] \nrequirement\u201d; a handler \u201cwould need only to find a con-\nsumer who is willing to join in or initiate an action in the \ndistrict court.\u201d  Id. at 348.  Because that result would \n\u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the exhaustion requirement, the \nCourt found it \u201cclear that Congress intended that judi-\ncial review of market orders  * * *  ordinarily be con-\nfined to suits brought by handlers.\u201d  Ibid.   \nMost of this Court\u2019s and Judge Scalia\u2019s reasoning in \nBlock also applies here.  An FDA order denying an ap-\nplication for marketing authorization has a direct and \nimmediate effect on the applicant itself, but only an in-\ndirect and incidental effect on retail sellers of the appli-\ncant\u2019s products.  The Act authorizes the applicant itself \nto participate in the regulatory process, but it contains \nno provision for participation by retailers.  And allowing \nretailer suits could hand applicants a convenient device \nfor evading the Act\u2019s venue restrictions; unless this \nCourt rejects the court of appeals\u2019 rule that venue need \n\n25 \n \nbe proper only as to one party, a disappointed applicant \ncould simply find a retailer that is willing to join in a \npetition for review in a preferred circuit.  Those fea-\ntures of the statutory scheme all indicate that only ap-\nplicants, not retailers, may seek judicial review of or-\nders denying applications.  \nIn some respects, this case follows a fortiori from \nBlock.  Block involved a suit under the APA, see 467 \nU.S. at 345, while this case involves a petition for review \nunder the Tobacco Control Act.  The Court has applied \nthe zone-of-interests test more stringently in non-APA \ncases than in APA cases.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  \nBlock also involved judicial review of a rulemaking, see \n467 U.S. at 342, while this case involves judicial review \nof an adjudication.  It is particularly natural to infer that \nonly the parties to an adjudication may challenge its \noutcome in court.  See p. 14, supra.   \n4. The court of appeals\u2019 reasoning is flawed \nThe court of appeals reasoned that a retail seller may \nseek judicial review of a denial order because such an \norder \u201caffect[s]\u201d the seller by reducing its sales.  Pet. \nApp. 4a.  But as explained above, the phrase \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d is a term of art in administrative law.  See pp. \n11-12, supra.  The critical question is not whether a de-\nnial order harms the seller in some way; it is whether \nthat harm \u201cconstitutes adverse effect\u201d within the mean-\ning of the Act.  Newport News, 514 U.S. at 126 (empha-\nsis omitted).  For the reasons given above, the Act\u2019s \nstructure shows that it does not.   \nThe court of appeals also emphasized that the statute \nrefers to \u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d  Pet. App. 4a \n(quoting 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)).  But \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 can-\nnot expand the phrase\u201d that follows.  National Ass\u2019n of \nManufacturers v. Department of Defense, 583 U.S. 109, \n\n26 \n \n123 (2018).  Despite the inclusion of the word \u201cany,\u201d the \nterm \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d still requires a \nshowing that the person has been \u201cadversely affected,\u201d \nwhich in turn requires a showing that the person falls \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the statutory \nprovision at issue.  See, e.g., Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n126 (interpreting 33 U.S.C. 921(c), which referred to \n\u201cany person adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d) (brackets \nomitted).   \nThe court of appeals next contrasted the provision at \nissue here\u2014under which an \u201cadversely affected\u201d person \nmay challenge a denial order, 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)\u2014with \nthe provision under which the \u201cholder of an application\u201d \nmay challenge a withdrawal order, 21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2).  \nSee Pet. App. 4a-5a.  The court read too much into that \ncontrast.  The provision at issue authorizes judicial re-\nview not only of a \u201cdenial\u201d of an application, but also of \na \u201cregulation\u201d establishing, amending, or revoking a to-\nbacco product standard.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The term \n\u201cholder of an application,\u201d used in the narrower provi-\nsion specifically addressing judicial review of with-\ndrawal orders, would have been a poor fit for the full \nrange of agency actions covered by the provision here.  \nIf anything, the provision concerning judicial review of \nwithdrawal orders cuts against the court of appeals\u2019 \nreading.  It would have been incongruous for Congress \nto allow retailers to challenge denial orders, but not to \nchallenge withdrawal orders.  See pp. 22-23, supra.    \nFinally, the court of appeals stated that concerns \nabout petitions for review filed by retailers should be \n\u201cdirected to Congress,\u201d not to the courts.  Pet. App. 5a.  \nBut that suggestion rests on the mistaken premise that \nthe statute, as written, allows retailers to seek judicial \nreview.  The term \u201cadversely affected\u201d requires \u201cthe \n\n27 \n \ncourts\u201d to infer, \u201cin the context of  * * *  the particular \nstatutory pattern,\u201d \u201cwho is entitled to judicial review.\u201d  \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on \nthe Administrative Procedure Act 96 (1947); see New-\nport News, 514 U.S. at 126-127 (quoting the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Manual).  Courts must carry out the function \nthat Congress entrusted to them.  And as discussed \nabove, the statutory pattern here shows that retailers \nmay not challenge an FDA order denying a manufac-\nturer\u2019s application. \nB. A Manufacturer May File A Petition For Review Only \nIn The D.C. Circuit Or The Circuit Where It Is Based  \nThe Fifth Circuit further erred by holding that a \ngroup of petitioners may file a petition for review in a \ncircuit so long as \u201ca petitioner\u201d resides or maintains its \nprincipal place of business within that circuit.  R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 188 (5th Cir. \n2023) (emphasis added); see Pet. App. 5a.  Unless Con-\ngress provides otherwise, courts must evaluate venue \nparty by party, and venue must be proper as to each \nparty.  A petitioner for whom venue is improper may not \nsimply tag along with one for whom it is proper.  See \nAmerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commis-\nsion, 338 F.2d 808, 809-810 (10th Cir. 1964) (interpret-\ning a similarly worded venue statute to mean that an out-\nof-circuit petitioner could not join a local petitioner); Na-\ntional Family Farm Coalition v. EPA, 966 F.3d 893, \n930-932 (9th Cir. 2020) (Nelson, J., concurring) (same).  \n1. The Act does not authorize one person to lay venue \nbased on a different person\u2019s residence or principal \nplace of business \nIn general, a party may bring a suit only if a statute \nauthorizes it to do so.  See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \n\n28 \n \nU.S. 275, 286-287 (2001).  That authorization ordinarily \nmust be explicit; Congress usually does not create new \nremedies by implication.  See Cummings v. Premier \nRehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 226 (2022).  The \ngovernment thus does not bear the burden of showing \nthat the Tobacco Control Act prohibits Reynolds from \nseeking judicial review in the Fifth Circuit.  Instead, re-\nspondents bear the burden of proving that the Act af-\nfirmatively authorizes Reynolds to do so.  They cannot \nmake that showing. \nThe Act states that \u201cany person adversely affected \nby [a] regulation or denial may file a petition for judicial \nreview of such regulation or denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added).  The word \u201csuch,\u201d when used to modify a \nnoun, refers back to something \u201cpreviously spoken of.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, 477 (1827).  \nThe term \u201csuch person\u201d thus makes clear that a person \nmay seek judicial review in a circuit (other than the D.C. \nCircuit) only if that person is based in that circuit.  \nParty A may not sue in a circuit just because party B \nlives there.  The court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatute to allow a person to sue in \u201cthe circuit in which \nsuch person [or a retail seller of such person\u2019s products] \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d  21 \nU.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \nThe Act also uses singular rather than plural nouns, \nauthorizing a \u201cperson\u201d to file \u201ca petition\u201d in the circuit \nwhere the \u201cperson\u201d resides or has its principal place of \nbusiness.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That matters because \nthe use of the singular or the plural can illuminate a \nstatute\u2019s meaning.  See Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. 155, 161-164 (2021); Life Technologies Corp. v. \nPromega Corp., 580 U.S. 140, 149-151 (2017).  Here, the \n\u201cuse of the singular noun \u2018person\u2019  * * *  suggests venue \nshould be analyzed on a petitioner-by-petitioner basis.\u201d  \nNational Family Farm Coalition, 966 F.3d at 930 (Nel-\nson, J., concurring). \nFinally, the Act lists three venues in which a person \nmay seek judicial review: the D.C. Circuit, the circuit \nwhere the person resides, and the circuit in which the \nperson has its principal place of business.  See 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1).  The Act\u2019s enumeration of those three options \nimplies the exclusion of others, such as the circuit where \na co-petitioner resides.  Expressio unius est exclusio al-\nterius.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 300 \n(2018); Scalia & Garner 107. \n2. Traditional principles of joinder confirm that an out-\nof-circuit manufacturer does not acquire a right to \nsue in a circuit by joining a local retailer \nAlthough the Act does not address the filing of joint \npetitions, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure \nprovide that \u201ctwo or more persons may join in a petition \nto the same court to review the same order\u201d if \u201ctheir \ninterests make joinder practicable.\u201d  Fed. R. App. P. \n15(a)(1).  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure similarly \nallow multiple plaintiffs to join in one complaint.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).  Joinder, however, just allows \nsuits that could have been brought separately to be \nbrought together; it does not allow an out-of-circuit \nmanufacturer to piggyback on a local retailer\u2019s claims.   \nJoinder is a device for the \u201caggregation of claims.\u201d  \nSprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., \n554 U.S. 269, 291 (2008).  Although it \u201cenables a federal \ncourt to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, \ninstead of in separate suits,\u201d it \u201cleaves the parties\u2019 legal \n\n30 \n \nrights and duties intact and the rules of decision un-\nchanged.\u201d  Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. All-\nstate Insurance Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality \nopinion).  Said otherwise, joinder rules \u201care procedural \nmeans of processing claims, not fonts of judicial author-\nity.\u201d  Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, 362 \n(2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part).  \nThus, if multiple plaintiffs join in one complaint, \n\u201ceach plaintiff\u200a\u2019s right of action remains distinct, as if it \nhad been brought separately.\u201d  7 Charles Alan Wright \net al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1652, at 414 \n(4th ed. 2019) (Wright & Miller).  Joinder cannot \u201cres-\ncue claims that would have been doomed  * * *  if they \nhad been asserted in a separate action\u201d; conversely, it \ndoes not require \u201cdismissal of claims that would have \notherwise survived.\u201d  Rockwell International Corp. v. \nUnited States, 549 U.S. 457, 476 (2007) (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Merena v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., \n205 F.3d 97, 103 (3d Cir. 2000) (Alito, J.)).   \nThe Tobacco Control Act plainly would not allow \nReynolds to file its own petition for review in the Fifth \nCircuit.  Under ordinary principles of joinder, it follows \nthat Reynolds is equally unable to join someone else\u2019s \npetition in that circuit.  \n3. Traditional principles of venue confirm that venue \nmust be proper as to each petitioner  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the Act conflicts \nnot only with statutory text and traditional principles of \njoinder, but also with traditional principles of venue.  \n\u201cFaced with multi-party cases,\u201d this Court \u201clong ago \nheld that venue must be proper as to each party.\u201d  14D \nWright & Miller \u00a7 3807, at 204 (4th ed. 2013).  Today, \u201cit \nis common for courts to say that venue must be proper \n\n31 \n \nas to each claim and as to each party.\u201d  Id. at 206-207.  \nTreatise writers agree that, \u201cwhen a special venue stat-\nute allows venue where the plaintiff resides,\u201d \u201cvenue \nwould not be proper for [multiple] plaintiffs in a district \nin which only one of them resides.\u201d  Id. at 206. \nThis Court first applied that party-specific approach \nin interpreting a 19th-century statute authorizing a \nplaintiff to bring a diversity suit \u201cin the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defend[a]nt.\u201d  Act \nof Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 373, \u00a7 1, 24 Stat. 552-553.  In Smith \nv. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890), the Court held that the \nstatute\u2019s reference to \u201cthe plaintiff\u200a\u201d meant every plain-\ntiff, not just one plaintiff.  See id. at 317-320.  And in \nCamp v. Gress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919), the Court held that \nthe term \u201cthe defendant\u201d in a similarly worded succes-\nsor statute meant every defendant, not just one defend-\nant.  See id. at 311-316.  Those decisions establish that, \nin a multi-party case, \u201ceach plaintiff must be competent \nto sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant must be liable to be sued\u201d \nin the chosen forum.  Smith, 133 U.S. at 319 (citation \nomitted); see Camp, 250 U.S. at 312 (requiring \u201ceach\u201d \nparty to be \u201ccompetent to sue, or liable to be sued,\u201d in \nthe chosen court) (citation omitted).  \nThis Court adhered to that approach in Bankers Life \n& Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379 (1953).  The \nvenue statute there allowed an antitrust plaintiff to sue \n\u201cin the district in which the defendant resides or is \nfound or has an agent.\u201d  15 U.S.C. 15(a).  Even though \nantitrust cases routinely involve conspiracies among \nmultiple defendants, the Court analyzed venue one de-\nfendant at a time.  See Holland, 346 U.S. at 384.  It ex-\nplained that, when venue does not \u201clie in one district as \nto all defendants,\u201d proceedings would need to be \u201csev-\nered and transferred or filed in separate districts origi-\n\n32 \n \nnally.\u201d  Ibid.  The plaintiff had argued that each anti-\ntrust defendant could be regarded as an \u201cagent\u201d of his \nco-conspirators, enabling all of them to be sued where \nany one of them lived.  See id. at 380-381.  But the Court \nrejected that theory, stating that it had \u201call the ear-\nmarks of a frivolous albeit ingenious attempt to expand \nthe statute,\u201d which had \u201cplaced definite limits on \nvenue.\u201d  Id. at 384.  The Court thus explained that \n\u201cmany such cases would not lie in one district as to all \ndefendants, unless venue was waived\u201d as a defense.  \nIbid. \nIn fact, other precedents of this Court require courts \nto evaluate venue not just party by party, but claim by \nclaim.  See Geneva Furniture Manufacturing Co. v.  \nS. Karpen & Bros., 238 U.S. 254, 258-259 (1915).  In \nother words, \u201cif the plaintiff asserts multiple claims \nagainst the defendant, venue must be proper for each \nclaim.\u201d  14D Wright & Miller \u00a7 3808, at 213.  That rule \nconfirms the broader principle that venue \u201ccannot be \nenlarged or extended by uniting [different causes of ac-\ntion] in a single suit.\u201d  Geneva, 238 U.S. at 259.  \nThis Court\u2019s party-by-party approach to venue is \nconsistent with its party-by-party approach to other \nthreshold statutory requirements.  For example, the \nCourt has long interpreted the diversity-jurisdiction \nstatute to require complete diversity; each plaintiff \nmust be diverse from each defendant.  See Strawbridge \nv. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267, 267-268 (1806).  The Court has \nread amount-in-controversy requirements, in the diver-\nsity statute as well as in other jurisdictional grants, to \nmean that \u201ceach of several plaintiffs is bound to estab-\nlish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own \nclaim.\u201d  Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 590 \n(1939); see Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U.S. \n\n33 \n \n291, 294-295 & n.3 (1973) (collecting cases).  And the \nCourt has interpreted the removal statute to mean that, \nwhen \u201cthere is more than one defendant, all the defend-\nants must join\u201d in removing the case from state to fed-\neral court.  Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur, & Evansville \nRy. Co., 179 U.S. 335, 337 (1900); see Chicago, Rock Is-\nland, & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Martin, 178 U.S. 245, 248 \n(1900).   \nThe party-by-party approach to venue vindicates the \ngeneral purpose of such provisions.  The plaintiff, as \nmaster of its complaint, controls which co-plaintiffs and \nco-defendants it will name.  But \u201cthe purpose of statu-\ntorily specified venue is to protect the defendant.\u201d  \nLeroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 183-\n184 (1979).  Venue restrictions would not serve that pur-\npose if a plaintiff could evade them simply by adding \nmore parties to its complaint.  \nThe principle that venue must be proper as to each \nparty is, of course, simply a default rule.  Congress is \nfree to adopt a different approach in a particular stat-\nute.  Congress has thus enacted special venue statutes \nthat authorize suit where \u201cany party resides,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n44309(d)(1); where \u201cany plaintiff resides,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n2334(a); where \u201cany defendant resides,\u201d 43 U.S.C. \n1349(b)(1); where \u201ca defendant in the action resides,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(A); or where \u201cany one defendant can \nbe found,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3732(a).  It has also provided that, \nin certain cases, a \u201cjoinder of  * * *  a defendant shall be \ndisregarded in determining where the action may be \nbrought with respect to the other defendants.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1391(c)(3).   \nThe statute at issue here, however, does not allow an \nadversely affected person to seek judicial review in a \ncircuit where \u201cany petitioner\u201d resides.  Nor does it state \n\n34 \n \nthat a joinder may be disregarded in analyzing venue.  \nTo the contrary, by authorizing an adversely affected \nperson to sue in the circuit where \u201csuch person resides \nor has their principal place of business,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1), the Act makes clear that a person may seek \nreview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) only if \nthat person is based in the circuit.  See pp. 28-29, supra.   \nC. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Interpretation Effectively Nullifies \nThe Act\u2019s Restrictions On Venue \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors\u2014allowing retailers to sue \nand requiring venue to be proper as to only one party\u2014\ncombine to produce a result that defies elementary \nprinciples of statutory interpretation.  A court should \nread a statute \u201cso that effect is given to all provisions, \nso that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void \nor insignificant.\u201d  Ysleta del sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 \nU.S. 685, 698-699 (2022) (citation omitted).  Courts \nshould avoid readings that would facilitate a statute\u2019s \n\u201cevasion\u201d or would enable parties \u201cto elude its provi-\nsions in the most easy manner.\u201d  The Emily, 9 Wheat. \n381, 389-390 (1824); see Scalia & Garner 63.   \nThose principles apply to venue statutes no less than \nto other statutes.  This Court has resisted reading \nvenue statutes in a way that would, in practice, \u201cgive the \nplaintiff an unrestrained choice of venues.\u201d  Leroy, 443 \nU.S. at 186-187 & n.23.  The Court has likewise avoided \ninterpretations that would \u201cencourage gamesmanship\u201d \nor \u201c\u200a\u2018create or multiply opportunities for forum shop-\nping.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. United \nStates District Court, 571 U.S. 49, 65 (2013) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, \n447 (2004) (rejecting interpretation that would allow \n\u201crampant forum shopping\u201d). \n\n35 \n \nContrary to those fundamental principles, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach drains the Act\u2019s venue restrictions of \nmeaning, facilitates their ready circumvention, and in-\nvites unchecked forum shopping.  Even though the Act \nspecifies only three venues where a person may seek ju-\ndicial review, see 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1), the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading allows an applicant to seek review in any \nregional circuit through the simple expedient of enlist-\ning a local retailer that is interested in selling (or a local \nconsumer who is interested in using) its products.  This \nCourt should not lightly conclude that Congress en-\nacted such a \u201cself-defeating statute.\u201d  Pugin v. Gar-\nland, 599 U.S. 600, 607 (2023) (citation omitted); see Cit-\nizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 20 \n(1995) (\u201cIt is an elementary rule of construction that \n\u2018the act cannot be held to destroy itself.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation undermines the \nAct\u2019s venue framework in additional ways.  By author-\nizing each adversely affected person to seek judicial re-\nview in that person\u2019s home circuit, the Act spreads out \nthe work of reviewing denial orders across all the re-\ngional circuits.  That is no small matter given the vol-\nume of work involved; FDA has received more than 27 \nmillion applications for marketing authorization since \n2024.  See Testimony of Brian A. King, Dir., Center for \nTobacco Products, FDA, Evaluating FDA Human \nFoods and Tobacco Programs (Sept. 10, 2024).  Under \nthe decision below, however, applicants throughout the \ncountry\u2014indeed, throughout the world\u2014could all head \nto a single circuit for judicial review.  That concern is \nnot hypothetical; as discussed above, applicants from \nChina, California, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, \nOhio, and Washington have all flocked to the Fifth Cir-\n\n36 \n \ncuit.  See pp. 10-11, supra.  That result thwarts Con-\ngress\u2019s effort to allocate cases among the circuits in an \norderly and sensible way.  Cf. Pet. Br. at 15, TC Heart-\nland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. \n258 (2017) (No. 16-341) (noting that plaintiffs had ex-\nploited an expansive reading of the patent venue statute \n\u2014which this Court ultimately reversed\u2014to file roughly \n40% of the Nation\u2019s patent cases in a single district).  \nThe Act, moreover, designates the D.C. Circuit as \nthe sole circuit where a person may seek judicial review \nregardless of residence or principal place of business.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That provision reflects the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201cunique character\u201d as a \u201cnational court\u201d \nwith \u201cspecial responsibility to review legal challenges to \nthe conduct of the national government,\u201d irrespective of \nwhere the challenger lives.  John G. Roberts, Jr., What \nMakes the D.C. Circuit Different? A Historical View, \n92 Va. L. Rev. 375, 389 (2006).  Yet the decision below \nwould transform every regional court of appeals into  \nanother national court.  It would allow every circuit to \nhear cases brought there by manufacturers from \naround the country (and the world), defeating Con-\ngress\u2019s decision to vest such nationwide responsibility \nin the D.C. Circuit alone. \nIf Congress had meant to allow an applicant to seek \njudicial review in any circuit, it would have said so.  \nSome federal statutes authorize suit in \u201cany United \nStates district court,\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1640(e), or \u201cany United \nStates Court of Appeals,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 7482(b)(2).  The To-\nbacco Control Act, however, contains no such provision.  \nThe Fifth Circuit nonetheless held that an applicant \nmay file a petition for review anywhere in the country, \nso long as it can find a local retailer willing to join its \npetition.  But the court \u201coffered no reason for Congress \n\n37 \n \nto have constructed such an obscure path to such a sim-\nple result.\u201d  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 52 (2012). \nThe potential consequences of the court of appeals\u2019 \napproach extend beyond the Tobacco Control Act.  Many \nfederal statutes authorize an adversely affected or ag-\ngrieved person to challenge an agency order in the D.C. \nCircuit or the circuit where the person is based.3  But \nthe logic of the decision below would make it easy for \nchallengers to avoid those restrictions:  A challenger \nneed only (1) find someone who lives in the preferred \ncircuit and is indirectly affected by the order and \n(2) seek review alongside that person.   \nThe forum shopping invited by the decision below \nnot only violates the Act, but also harms the Judiciary.  \nWhen parties throughout the country deploy complex \nprocedural stratagems to channel their cases to a single \ncircuit, even when they have no meaningful ties to that \ncircuit, they erode the perception that judicial decisions \nrest on universally applicable rules of law.  This Court \nshould avoid that harm by correcting the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 erroneous interpretation of the Act\u2019s venue provi-\nsion.   \n \n3 See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 7123(a); 15 U.S.C. 77i(a), 80a\u201342(a), 80b\u201313(a), \n1710(a); 20 U.S.C. 6083(f\u200a)(5), 7973(e)(5); 21 U.S.C. 346a(h)(1), \n348(g)(1), 360g(a), 457(d), 607(e), 1036(b); 22 U.S.C. 6761(a)(5);  \n29 U.S.C. 160(f\u200a), 210(a), 660(a); 49 U.S.C. 5127(a), 47106(d)(3), \n47111(d)(3). \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C. Circuit.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS \nGeneral Counsel \nDepartment of Health and \nHuman Services \nMARK RAZA \nChief Counsel \nWENDY S.

or \n \n(B) \nany modification (including a change in \ndesign, any component, any part, or any constitu-\nent, including a smoke constituent, or in the con-\ntent, delivery or form of nicotine, or any other ad-\nditive or ingredient) of a tobacco product where \nthe modified product was commercially marketed \nin the United States after February 15, 2007. \n(2) Premarket review required \n \n(A) \nNew products \n \nAn order under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for a new \ntobacco product is required unless\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthe manufacturer has submitted a re-\nport under section 387e(\u200aj) of this title; and the \nSecretary has issued an order that the tobacco \nproduct\u2014 \n \n(I) \nis substantially equivalent to a to-\nbacco product commercially marketed (other \n\n2a \n \nthan for test marketing) in the United \nStates as of February 15, 2007;

or \n \n(ii) \nhas different characteristics and the \ninformation submitted contains information, \nincluding clinical data if deemed necessary by \nthe Secretary, that demonstrates that it is not \nappropriate to regulate the product under this \nsection because the product does not raise dif-\nferent questions of public health. \n \n(B) \nCharacteristics \n \nIn subparagraph (A), the term \u201ccharacteris-\ntics\u201d means the materials, ingredients, design, \ncomposition, heating source, or other features of a \ntobacco product. \n \n(C) \nLimitation \n \nA tobacco product may not be found to be sub-\nstantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco prod-\nuct that has been removed from the market at the \ninitiative of the Secretary or that has been deter-\nmined by a judicial order to be misbranded or \nadulterated. \n(4) Health information \n \n(A) \nSummary \n \nAs part of a submission under section 387e(\u200aj) of \nthis title respecting a tobacco product, the person \nrequired to file a premarket notification under \nsuch section shall provide an adequate summary \nof any health information related to the tobacco \n\n4a \n \nproduct or state that such information will be \nmade available upon request by any person. \n \n(B) \nRequired information \n \nAny summary under subparagraph (A) re-\nspecting a tobacco product shall contain detailed \ninformation regarding data concerning adverse \nhealth effects and shall be made available to the \npublic by the Secretary within 30 days of the issu-\nance of a determination that such tobacco product \nis substantially equivalent to another tobacco \nproduct. \n(b) \nApplication \n(1) Contents \n \nAn application under this section shall contain\u2014 \n \n(A) \nfull reports of all information, published \nor known to, or which should reasonably be known \nto, the applicant, concerning investigations which \nhave been made to show the health risks of such \ntobacco product and whether such tobacco prod-\nuct presents less risk than other tobacco products;

and \n \n(B) \nthe increased or decreased likelihood \nthat those who do not use tobacco products will \nstart using such products. \n(5) Basis for action \n \n(A) \nInvestigations \n \nFor purposes of paragraph (2)(A), whether per-\nmitting a tobacco product to be marketed would \nbe appropriate for the protection of the public \nhealth shall, when appropriate, be determined on \nthe basis of well-controlled investigations, which \nmay include 1 or more clinical investigations by \nexperts qualified by training and experience to \nevaluate the tobacco product. \n \n(B) \nOther evidence \n \nIf the Secretary determines that there exists \nvalid scientific evidence (other than evidence de-\nrived from investigations described in subpara-\ngraph (A)) which is sufficient to evaluate the to-\nbacco product, the Secretary may authorize that \nthe determination for purposes of paragraph \n(2)(A) be made on the basis of such evidence. \n \n \n\n9a \n \n(d) \nWithdrawal and temporary suspension \n(1) In general \n \nThe Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appro-\npriate, advice on scientific matters from the Tobacco \nProducts Scientific Advisory Committee, and after \ndue notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a \ntobacco product for which an order was issued under \nsubsection (c)(1)(A)(i), issue an order withdrawing \nthe order if the Secretary finds\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthat the continued marketing of such to-\nbacco product no longer is appropriate for the pro-\ntection of the public health; \n \n(B) \nthat the application contained or was ac-\ncompanied by an untrue statement of a material \nfact; \n \n(C) \nthat the applicant\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas failed to establish a system for \nmaintaining records, or has repeatedly or de-\nliberately failed to maintain records or to make \nreports, required by an applicable regulation \nunder section 387i of this title; \n \n(ii) \nhas refused to permit access to, or \ncopying or verification of, such records as re-\nquired by section 374 of this title; or \n \n(iii) \nhas not complied with the require-\nments of section 387e of this title; \n \n(D) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary with respect to such tobacco prod-\nuct, evaluated together with the evidence before \nthe Secretary when the application was reviewed, \n\n10a \n \nthat the methods used in, or the facilities and con-\ntrols used for, the manufacture, processing, pack-\ning, or installation of such tobacco product do not \nconform with the requirements of section 387f(e) \nof this title and were not brought into conformity \nwith such requirements within a reasonable time \nafter receipt of written notice from the Secretary \nof nonconformity; \n \n(E) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary, evaluated together with the evi-\ndence before the Secretary when the application \nwas reviewed, that the labeling of such tobacco \nproduct, based on a fair evaluation of all material \nfacts, is false or misleading in any particular and \nwas not corrected within a reasonable time after \nreceipt of written notice from the Secretary of \nsuch fact; or \n \n(F) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary, evaluated together with the evi-\ndence before the Secretary when such order was \nissued, that such tobacco product is not shown to \nconform in all respects to a tobacco product stand-\nard which is in effect under section 387g of this ti-\ntle, compliance with which was a condition to the \nissuance of an order relating to the application, \nand that there is a lack of adequate information to \njustify the deviation from such standard. \n(2) Appeal \n \nThe holder of an application subject to an order \nissued under paragraph (1) withdrawing an order is-\nsued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) may, by peti-\ntion filed on or before the 30th day after the date \n\n11a \n \nupon which such holder receives notice of such with-\ndrawal, obtain review thereof in accordance with sec-\ntion 387l of this title. \n(3) Temporary suspension \n \nIf, after providing an opportunity for an informal \nhearing, the Secretary determines there is reasona-\nble probability that the continuation of distribution of \na tobacco product under an order would cause seri-\nous, adverse health consequences or death, that is \ngreater than ordinarily caused by tobacco products \non the market, the Secretary shall by order tempo-\nrarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to \nmarket the product.  If the Secretary issues such an \norder, the Secretary shall proceed expeditiously un-\nder paragraph (1) to withdraw such application. \n(e) \nService of order \nAn order issued by the Secretary under this section \nshall be served\u2014 \n \n(1) in person by any officer or employee of the \ndepartment designated by the Secretary; or \n \n(2) by mailing the order by registered mail or \ncertified mail addressed to the applicant at the appli-\ncant\u2019s last known address in the records of the Sec-\nretary. \n(f\u200a) \nRecords \n(1) Additional information \n \nIn the case of any tobacco product for which an \norder issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for an \napplication filed under subsection (b) is in effect, the \napplicant shall establish and maintain such records, \n\n12a \n \nand make such reports to the Secretary, as the Sec-\nretary may by regulation, or by order with respect to \nsuch application, prescribe on the basis of a finding \nthat such records and reports are necessary in order \nto enable the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a \ndetermination of, whether there is or may be grounds \nfor withdrawing or temporarily suspending such or-\nder. \n(2) Access to records \n \nEach person required under this section to main-\ntain records, and each person in charge of custody \nthereof, shall, upon request of an officer or employee \ndesignated by the Secretary, permit such officer or \nemployee at all reasonable times to have access to \nand copy and verify such records. \n(g) \nInvestigational tobacco product exemption for in-\nvestigational use \nThe Secretary may exempt tobacco products in-\ntended for investigational use from the provisions of this \nsubchapter under such conditions as the Secretary may \nby regulation prescribe. \n \n \n \n\n13a \n \n2. \n21 U.S.C. 387l provides: \nJudicial review \n(a) \nRight to review \n(1) In general \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe promulgation of a regulation under \nsection 387g of this title establishing, amending, \nor revoking a tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B) \na denial of an application under section \n387j(c) of this title, \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business. \n(2) Requirements \n \n(A) \nCopy of petition \n \nA copy of the petition filed under paragraph (1) \nshall be transmitted by the clerk of the court in-\nvolved to the Secretary. \n \n(B) \nRecord of proceedings \n \nOn receipt of a petition under subparagraph \n(A), the Secretary shall file in the court in which \nsuch petition was filed\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthe record of the proceedings on which \nthe regulation or order was based; and \n\n14a \n \n \n(ii) \na statement of the reasons for the is-\nsuance of such a regulation or order. \n \n(C) \nDefinition of record \n \n \nIn this section, the term \u201crecord\u201d means\u2014 \n \n(i) \nall notices and other matter published \nin the Federal Register with respect to the reg-\nulation or order reviewed; \n \n(ii) \nall information submitted to the Sec-\nretary with respect to such regulation or order; \n \n(iii) \nproceedings of any panel or advisory \ncommittee with respect to such regulation or \norder; \n \n(iv) \nany hearing held with respect to such \nregulation or order; and \n \n(v) \nany other information identified by \nthe Secretary, in the administrative proceeding \nheld with respect to such regulation or order, \nas being relevant to such regulation or order. \n(b) \nStandard of review \nUpon the filing of the petition under subsection (a) \nfor judicial review of a regulation or order, the court \nshall have jurisdiction to review the regulation or order \nin accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to grant ap-\npropriate relief, including interim relief, as provided for \nin such chapter.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to evolve, and this latest observation provides a critical, albeit negative, piece of evidence that directly addresses a key uncertainty I previously identified. My prior belief state had been significantly balanced by the Atlantic Legal Foundation (ALF) amicus brief in support of the Respondents, which presented powerful textual and structural arguments. I had noted, however, that my analysis was incomplete without seeing whether the Petitioner (FDA) would receive similar amicus support to bolster its legal arguments.\n\nThe new observation, a failed search for amicus briefs supporting the FDA, resolves this uncertainty for now. The search explicitly queried for briefs \"in support of petitioner\" and returned none, instead finding only documents related to the ALF's brief in support of the *Respondents*. This is not merely an absence of evidence; it is evidence of absence. It serves as a strong signal that the FDA's legal position may be isolated and lacks support from other stakeholders who might typically align with a federal agency, such as public health organizations or administrative law scholars.\n\nThis observation significantly alters my assessment of the case's dynamics and strengthens the relative position of the Respondents. My cumulative understanding is now as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Weakened):**\n    *   **Institutional Need to Prevent Forum Shopping:** This remains the FDA's most compelling argument and will likely be the primary focus of justices concerned with judicial administration and the institutional integrity of the courts. The specter of manufacturers picking favorable circuits by finding a single downstream retailer is a powerful practical concern.\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation (\"Term of Art\"):** The FDA's legal argument\u2014that \"any person adversely affected\" is a term of art limited to the direct recipient of the agency order (the applicant)\u2014now appears significantly weaker. The lack of supporting amicus briefs suggests that other legal experts do not find this interpretation persuasive or defensible. The FDA's position seems to stand alone, framed more as a post-hoc justification for achieving its desired institutional outcome (preventing forum shopping) rather than a robust interpretation of the statute's text and established administrative law principles.\n\n*   **Respondents' Position (Strengthened):**\n    *   **Direct Legal Injury:** The argument that retailers are directly \"adversely affected\" because the denial order exposes them to legal jeopardy (prosecution for selling \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated\" products) remains a cornerstone of their case. This argument directly refutes the FDA's claim that the harm is merely indirect economic fallout.\n    *   **Statutory Text and Structure:** The *expressio unius* argument\u2014that Congress knew how to limit review to \"the holder of an application\" (as it did in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2)) but chose broader language here (\u00a7 387l(a)(1))\u2014is now more prominent. The absence of any amicus counter-arguments on this point makes it stand out as a powerful piece of textual evidence.\n    *   **Systemic Administrative Law Concerns:** The ALF's argument that a narrow ruling for the FDA would disrupt judicial review across dozens of other statutes using the same \"any person adversely affected\" language now carries more weight. Without any amici arguing that these fears are overblown or that this case can be narrowly distinguished, the Court faces a clearer risk of setting a broad, destabilizing precedent.\n\nIn summary, the landscape of persuasion has tilted. While I previously saw the case as balanced between the Respondents' strong textual arguments and the FDA's strong institutional arguments, the FDA's legal-textual position has been undercut by its apparent isolation. The contest is now more clearly framed as a choice between upholding the plain text of a judicial review statute, with its broad implications for administrative law, versus carving out an exception to prevent a specific practical problem (forum shopping). While the forum shopping concern is not trivial, the lopsided support on the statutory interpretation question increases the likelihood that the Court will favor the Respondents' reading of the law. My belief has shifted from the case being balanced to it now leaning in favor of affirming the Fifth Circuit.",

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.

Reg. 28,974, 28,977 (May 10, 2016); see \nalso id. at 29,001 (\u201cas a practical effect of the Agency\u2019s \ncompliance \npolicy \u2026 FDA \nexpects \nthat \nmany \nmanufacturers \u2026 will continue to market their products\u201d); \nFDA, Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery \nSystems and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without \nPremarket Authorization 27 (Apr. 2020). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStores Association (\u201cMississippi Association\u201d), are \nretailers that sell menthol-flavored Vuse Alto. Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n16: 20240703113830760_23-1187cos.json (score: 0.446)\nNo. 23-1187 \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ET AL., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nR.J.

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed.

Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d and \u201ca detrimental influence \non\u201d the retailer Respondents\u2019 interests, since they \ncannot sell the product at issue and if they do, will be \nsubject to severe penalties, see infra p. 12. Therefore, \nunder the plain text, retailer Respondents are \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s order. \nb. FDA tries to escape the statute\u2019s plain text by \nemphasizing that \u201c\u2018adversely affected\u2019 is a term of art \nin administrative law,\u201d Pet. 11, but the Agency fares \nno better under this Court\u2019s statutory standing \njurisprudence. The zone-of-interests test that this \nCourt has applied to determine when a party is \nsufficiently aggrieved to challenge agency action \u201cis \nnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). A party has \nstatutory standing if it asserts an interest that is \n\u201carguably\u201d protected or regulated by the statute. \nE.g., id. at 225\u201326. The zone-of-interests test \n\u201cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.\u201d Id. All that is required is \u201csome \nindicia\u2014however slight\u2014that the litigant before the \ncourt \nwas \n[(i)] intended \nto \nbe \nprotected \u2026 or \n[(ii)] regulated by the statute\u201d\u2014either suffices. \nCalumet Indus., Inc. v.

There, the \nCity of Miami sued several banks under the Fair \nHousing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), alleging that the banks \nengaged in discriminatory lending in the residential \nhousing market that caused the City economic harm. \nIn concluding that the City came within the FHA\u2019s \nzone of interests, the Supreme Court stressed the \ntextual \nbreadth \nof \nthe \nFHA\u2019s \njudicial-review \nprovision: \u201cThe FHA permits any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 \nto bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.\u201d Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)). Because the City \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclaimed that the banks\u2019 lending practices caused the \nCity\u2019s lost tax revenue, the Court concluded the City \nwas at least \u201carguably \u2026 within the FHA\u2019s zone of \ninterests\u201d\u2014even though the City did not suffer \ndiscrimination. Id. at 200\u201301.7 \nGiven this precedent, it is no wonder the Fifth \nCircuit rejected FDA\u2019s argument under the TCA. The \nstatutory language here\u2014\u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d\u2014is, if anything, broader than the FHA\u2019s \n\u201caggrieved person\u201d language. And the connection \nbetween the retailers\u2019 injuries and the interests \nprotected by the TCA is far more direct than the \nconnection between the City\u2019s lost tax revenue in \nBank of America and the FHA. This case thus follows \na fortiori from Bank of America. See also Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 144 S. Ct. 1414, 1423 \n(2024) (holding \u201can insurer such as Truck with \nfinancial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a \n\u2018party in interest\u2019 because it may be directly and \nadversely affected by the reorganization plan\u201d).8  \n \n7 Notably, the government filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of the position this Court adopted. See Brief for U.S. as \nAmicus Curiae Supporting Respondent, Bank of America, 581 \nU.S. 189, 2016 WL 5903233. \n8 The retailers\u2019 interests would establish standing even \nunder Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion in Bank of America. \nJustice Thomas concluded that the City\u2019s asserted injuries (lost \nrevenues and increased costs) did not implicate the interests \nprotected by the FHA. 581 U.S. at 207\u201309. (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part, dissenting in part). Here, there is no \nquestion that the retailers\u2019 injuries (inability to sell a tobacco \nproduct) directly implicate the interests protected by the TCA. \nSee infra p. 12. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nc. \nThis \nstraightforward \ninterpretation \nof \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), moreover, is confirmed by the structure \nof the TCA and statutory context. FDA seems to \nassert that, in allowing \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d to sue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded), Congress actually meant that \u201conly a \nmanufacturer of a product subject to a marketing \ndenial order\u201d or \u201conly an applicant whose premarket \napplication is denied\u201d could sue. But Congress knows \nhow to limit judicial-review provisions in that way, \nand, indeed, did so elsewhere in the TCA itself. \nCompare id. (\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may \nchallenge marketing denial orders for tobacco \nproducts), with id. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) (\u201c[t]he holder of an \napplication\u201d may challenge the withdrawal of \nmarketing authorization for tobacco products). For \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), in contrast, it uses the capacious phrase \n\u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d And \u201c[w]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order 4\u20135 \n(Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 \nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)); see also id. at 5 (\u201cCongress did \nnot limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those \nchallenging a withdrawal order. If the FDA disagrees \nwith Congress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the \n[TCA], its concerns are better directed to Congress \nthan to this court.\u201d). \nCongress also included rulemaking in the TCA\u2019s \njudicial-review provision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (\u201cany \nperson adversely affected by such regulation\u201d \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(emphasis added)). Under FDA\u2019s interpretation, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d would thus mean two \ndifferent \nthings \nin \nthe \nsame \nprovision: \nfor \nrulemaking, \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d means \n\u201cany person adversely affected,\u201d but for a denial \norder, \u201cany person adversely affect\u201d means \u201conly the \nadversely affected manufacturer.\u201d Basic interpretive \nrules reject such a reading. In a given statute, there \nis a presumption of consistent usage: the same term \nusually has the same meaning across different \napplications. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (\u201cTo give these same words [in a statutory \nphrase] a different meaning for each category would \nbe to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d). \nThe evidence that Congress meant what it said \ndoes not stop with the TCA. The U.S. Code is replete \nwith provisions that, unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1) here, \nexpressly limit the class of potential petitioners to \nparties who either played some specific role in the \nadministrative proceedings or satisfy other specified \ncriteria. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1047 (\u201cthe affected \napplicant\u201d) (emphasis added); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4634 (\u201cAny \nparty to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added); 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3247 (\u201cany party to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis \nadded); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (\u201cAny recipient which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 6869 (\u201cIf any \napplicant is dissatisfied\u201d) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 228b-3 (\u201cthe live poultry dealer\u201d) (emphasis added); \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189 (\u201cthe designated organization\u201d) \n(emphasis added); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (\u201cA person who is \nthe primary next of kin\u201d) (emphasis added); 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6717 (\u201cA unit of general local government which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 \n(\u201ca party\u201d to the order) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 7107 \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(\u201ca contractor\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263b (\u201cthe owner or \noperator\u201d) (emphasis added). \nA retailer thus easily falls within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. Bank of Am., 581 U.S. at 197 \n(\u201cclaims of financial injury \u2026 satisfy \u2026 \u2018prudential \nstanding\u2019\u201d). \nd. Looking at the statute more broadly reinforces \nthat retailers are within the zone of interests of both \nthe TCA as a whole and its premarket review \nprovisions in particular. Assessing this question, \ncourts generally ask whether the relevant statute \nregulates or protects the party. Calumet Indus., 807 \nF.2d at 228 (citing Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. \nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). If the \nstatute does, then the party is within the zone and \nhas statutory standing. Here, it is clear that the TCA \nboth regulates and protects retailers.  \nFirst, the TCA directly regulates retailers by: \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nthat FDA does not authorize, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 331, 387b(6); \n\u2022 authorizing seizures, fines, injunctions, and \ncriminal penalties against retailers who sell \nunauthorized products, id. \u00a7 334(a), (g); \n\u00a7 333(a), (f)(9)(A); \u00a7 332(a); \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nwith unauthorized \u201cmodified risk\u201d claims, \nid. \u00a7 387k(a); \n\u2022 requiring retailers to limit the location and \namount of any distribution of free samples \nof tobacco products, id. \u00a7 387a-1(d); \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any cigarette \nadvertisements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; and \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any smokeless \ntobacco product advertisements, id. \u00a7 4402.  \nAmong these numerous provisions, it is notable \nthat a denial order under the TCA dictates what \nproducts a retailer may sell. And FDA\u2019s enforcement \nefforts show that the statute means what it says. In \nannouncing its denial orders for menthol Vuse Vibe \nand Ciro, for example, FDA said that it \u201cintends to \nensure compliance by distributors and retailers.\u201d9 \nSimilarly, in announcing its denial order for menthol \nVuse Alto, FDA stated, \u201cIf the product is already on \nthe market, it must be removed from the market or \nrisk FDA enforcement.\u201d10 Moreover, in 2020, FDA \nwarned retailers it would enforce the TCA against \nthem.11 FDA has made good on that threat, issuing \nwarning letters and civil penalties to retailers who \nsold \nproducts \nthat \nreceived \nmarketing \ndenial \n \n9 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Two Vuse \nMenthol E-Cigarette Products Following Determination They Do \nNot \nMeet \nPublic \nHealth \nStandard \n(Jan. \n24, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4ck9644b (emphasis added). \n10 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Six Flavored \nVuse \nAlto \nE-Cigarette \nProducts \n(Oct. \n12, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5n8nb7c7. \n11 E.g., FDA, FDA Warns Manufacturers and Retailers \n(Apr. 27, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/uttfu7p7 (\u201cIf the recipients \nof these warning letters do not cease the manufacture, \ndistribution and/or sale of these unauthorized tobacco products, \nthey risk additional FDA action such as an injunction, seizure \nand/or civil money penalty actions.\u201d). \n\n \n15 \n \n \norders.12 Just this March, FDA announced that it \nhad issued warning letters to 61 retailers for selling \nunauthorized tobacco products.13 FDA also has \nsought and obtained injunctions against retailers. \nE.g., Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, \nUnited States v. Lucky Convenience & Tobacco, LLC, \nNo. 6:22-cv-1237 (D. Kan. Jan. 26, 2023). The TCA \nthus obviously regulates tobacco retailers.  \nSecond, the TCA also directly protects retailers by: \n\u2022 preserving retailers\u2019 ability to sell tobacco \nproducts by forbidding FDA from banning \nall cigarettes and certain other product \ncategories, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f; \n\u2022 providing retailers with an opportunity for a \nhearing prior to a no-tobacco-sale order, id. \n\u00a7 333(f)(8); \n\u2022 providing retailers with several procedural \nprotections \nregarding \ncertain \nalleged \nviolations of the Act, id. \u00a7 333 note; and \n\u2022 exempting \nretailers \nfrom \ncertain \nrecordkeeping \nrequirements, \nid. \n\u00a7 387t(b)(5). \nSignificantly for assessing whether retailers fall \nwithin the TCA\u2019s zone of interests, the Act expressly \ndeclares Congress\u2019s purpose \u201cto continue to permit \nthe sale of tobacco products to adults,\u201d including \n \n12 FDA, Advisory and Enforcement Actions Against \nIndustry \nfor \nUnauthorized \nTobacco \nProducts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mrxxt3ja (last visited July 2, 2024). \n13 FDA, FDA Warns 61 Brick and Mortar Retailers for \nthe Sale of Unauthorized E-Cigarettes Popular Among Youth \n(Mar. 26, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mpx2bjky. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nthrough retailers who comply with the TCA. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387 note. FDA cannot seriously maintain \nthat retailers like Respondents Avail, Mississippi \nAssociation, and RJR Vapor Co. L.L.C. fall outside \nthe Act\u2019s zone of interests when those entities are a \nconstant and integral subject of the Act\u2019s provisions. \ne. \nFor its part, FDA argues that \u201caspects of the \nstatutory structure demonstrate that the denial of a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application does not adversely affect \na seller.\u201d Pet. 11. But FDA only points to two \n(inapposite) provisions. The first provision is 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), where Congress provided that \nonly \u201cthe holder of an application\u201d may challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization. As noted \nabove, that provision cuts against FDA because \n\u201cCongress did not limit access to the courts for \nchallenging a denial order in the same way it did for \nthose challenging a withdrawal order.\u201d Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 5 (Feb. 2, 2024). This provision thus \ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to limit \njudicial review when it wanted to, and yet for the \ndenial of a premarket tobacco product application, \nauthorized a challenge by \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by it. See supra pp. 9\u201311. The second \nprovision to which FDA points is \u00a7 387f(c), where \nCongress \nlimited non-manufacturers\u2019 \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninformation \nunder \nthe \nFreedom \nof \nInformation Act. That provision, however, says \nnothing about\u2014and certainly does not contradict\u2014\nthe provision allowing judicial review by \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d Nor does FDA address the \nnumerous provisions that show beyond doubt that \nthe TCA regulates and protects retailers. See supra \npp. 12\u201314. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFDA\u2019s other counterarguments fare no better. FDA \nargues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cnullifies the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions.\u201d Pet. 15. According to FDA, \nthat is because a manufacturer can always find a \nretailer in a preferred circuit and sue there, rather \nthan in the manufacturer\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. \nCircuit. Even if so, the remedy would lie with \nCongress; FDA\u2019s argument does not authorize courts \nto ignore the statute\u2019s plain text. See SAS Inst. Inc. \nv. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1358 (2018) (\u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d).  \nFDA\u2019s argument is, in any event, wrong because \nthe fact that a manufacturer and some retailers may \njoin in a single petition does not render the Act\u2019s \nvenue restrictions a nullity. Venue must still be \nestablished. One petitioner must be located in the \nrelevant circuit unless it is the D.C. Circuit. See \nOrder Granting Mot. to Transfer, Shenzhen Yibo v. \nFDA, No. 24-60191 (5th Cir. May 20, 2024) (granting \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer Shenzhen Yibo\u2019s petition to \nthe D.C. Circuit because there was no local \nretailer).14 In addition, a manufacturer whose \nproducts are only sold in one area of the country \ncannot file wherever the manufacturer wants \nbecause retailers outside that one area would not be \nable to allege injuries in fact. For example, a \nVermont manufacturer that sells its own products \n(as many vape shops do) and is incorporated and \noperates only in Vermont cannot file a petition in the \n \n14 There undoubtedly will be cases where there will not \nbe a retailer who sells or wants to sell the denied product\u2014or at \nleast who is not motivated to pursue litigation. \n\n \n18 \n \n \nFifth Circuit. The venue provision thus operates to \nlimit available forums in that sort of case. But the \nTCA does not entirely shut out of court adversely \naffected retailers that wish to petition in their home \ncircuit. Indeed, under FDA\u2019s theory, a retailer could \nnever challenge a denial order\u2014a position that \nplainly conflicts with the statutory text.  \n2.  FDA poses an alternative argument, but it, too, \nmisses the mark. FDA argues that each petitioner \nmust independently establish venue, so that even if \nAvail and the Mississippi Association have statutory \nstanding and can establish venue, RJRV (which \nconcededly \nhas \nstatutory \nstanding) \nmay \nnot \nparticipate in the case but, instead, must file a \nseparate case in a different court challenging the \nsame denial order. Pet. 12\u201314. This argument is both \nforfeited and wrong. \na. \nAs an initial matter, FDA never advanced this \nargument below. While FDA did object to venue \nrepeatedly in the Fifth Circuit, FDA\u2019s argument was \nthat retailers could not sue at all under the TCA, and \nthat without them venue was not proper. FDA did \nnot, however, argue that each petitioner needed to \nindependently establish venue. That argument \nappeared nowhere in FDA\u2019s Motion to Transfer. It \nappeared \nnowhere \nin \nFDA\u2019s \nOpposition \nto \nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Stay. And it appeared \nnowhere in FDA\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc of \nthe Vibe stay order (or in any other filing). Because \nthis argument \u201cwas never presented to any lower \ncourt,\u201d it is \u201cforfeited.\u201d OBB Personenverkehr AG v. \nSachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 (2015); see also Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \n\n \n19 \n \n \nb. \nIn any event, FDA is wrong. Nothing in the \nstatutory language requires each petitioner to \nindividually establish venue. To the contrary, \nCongress enacted the TCA\u2019s venue provision against \na long-standing backdrop of similarly worded venue \nprovisions governing suits against the government, \nwhich federal courts have uniformly interpreted to \nmean that venue needs to be proper for only one \npetitioner or plaintiff.  \nThe Hobbs Act governs review in the courts of \nappeals of certain actions by a number of federal \nagencies. In language that clearly served as a model \nfor the TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision, the Hobbs \nAct provides that venue shall be \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its \nprincipal office\u201d (or in the D.C. Circuit). 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2343. Courts have uniformly interpreted this \nlanguage to mean that, as long as one petitioner \nresides or has its principal place of business within \nthe circuit, venue is proper for all petitioners.

For over five decades, federal courts \n\n \n20 \n \n \nhave uniformly interpreted that provision to mean \nthat venue can be established by any plaintiff. \nSidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, \n344\u201345 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cEach court faced with the \nsame issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d) (citing \ncases). The government agrees. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Civil Resource Manual 41 Venue (\u201cOnly one \nof the plaintiffs need reside in the district for venue \nto be proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(3).\u201d), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/58msjksk.15 \nThe TCA was enacted in 2009 against this \nlegislative backdrop. \u201cWhen administrative and \njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of \nan existing statutory provision, repetition of the \nsame language in a new statute indicates, as a \ngeneral matter, the intent to incorporate its \nadministrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201d \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). Thus, \nCongress did not intend for each petitioner to have to \nestablish venue individually under the TCA. Instead, \nif venue is proper for any one of the petitioners, then \nthe TCA\u2019s venue requirement is satisfied.   \n \n15 DOJ\u2019s Manual appears to have a typo\u2014the correct \nreference is \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393(e)(4),\u201d not (e)(3). Nonetheless, the \nstatute was amended in 2011 (after the manual was published), \nat which point \u00a7 1391(e)(4) became \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). The relevant \nlanguage remains the same.

Dec. 7, 2011).  \n\n \n21 \n \n \nThis longstanding and uniform interpretation, \nmoreover, \nmakes \nsense. \nOtherwise, \ndifferent \npetitioners would have to file separate lawsuits in \ndifferent courts challenging the same agency action. \nIndeed, in some situations, there could be a petition \nin every regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit. While \nthose petitions would be assigned to one circuit \neventually, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), there is no \nreason to force litigants and the court system to \nengage in this meaningless kabuki dance. When \nparties coordinate and file a single petition, it saves \neveryone time and resources (including FDA, which \nwill only have to respond to one petition). See Exxon \nCorp. v.

The \nstatute expressly contemplates that an improper \ndenial order will be \u201cset[ ] aside.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(c). \nSo even if the manufacturer and retailer were to file \nseparate petitions to have a denial order set aside, \nthe end result (if either prevails) would be the same. \nAs such, there is no sensible reason to force the \nmanufacturer and retailer to sue in different forums. \nConversely, FDA\u2019s interpretation does not make \nsense because it would not even solve the problem \nthat FDA purports to identify. A retailer, for \nexample, could challenge a denial order for a product \nthat it sells in its home circuit within ten days of the \ndenial order. Then, after those ten days but before \nexpiration of the thirty-day statute of limitations, a \nmanufacturer could challenge the same denial order \nin its home circuit. The result: both petitions would \nbe consolidated in the court in which the retailer \nfiled, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, thus (i) landing the case \nwhere FDA (erroneously) claims it does not belong, \nand (ii) multiplying the work of the appellate courts. \nBecause nothing in the Act requires each \npetitioner \nchallenging \na \ndenial \norder \nto \nindependently establish venue, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision was correct. See Alto C.A. Amended Order \n(Feb. 2, 2024).  \nc. \nAttempting to support its (forfeited) venue-as-\nto-each-petitioner argument, FDA relies on two, \ncentury-old cases interpreting irrelevant statutes. \nSee Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890); Camp v. \nGress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). Neither case helps FDA.  \n\n \n23 \n \n \nIn both cases, the statute provided, \u201c[W]here the \njurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the \naction is between citizens of different states, suit \nshall be brought only in the district of the residence \nof either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d Smith, 133 \nU.S. at 317; Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. In Smith, two \nplaintiffs, one from Arkansas and one from Missouri, \nsued a Texan. The Court held that venue under the \ndiversity-jurisdiction provision was lacking because \nthe two plaintiffs were not from the same state. See \nid. (holding that the statute \u201cmakes no provision in \nterms for the case of two defendants or two plaintiffs \nwho are citizens of different states\u201d). In so holding, \nthe Smith Court looked to Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \nopinion in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, which established \nthe \ncomplete \ndiversity \nrule\u2014for \ndiversity \njurisdiction, no plaintiff can be from the same state \nas any defendant. 3 Cranch 267 (1806). Whatever the \nwisdom of that rule and Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \ninterpretation of the venue provision,16 the Court \nconsistently applied it when interpreting that venue \nstatute governing diversity jurisdiction; because \nCongress (in 1890) had not legislatively changed the \nrelevant language interpreted by Strawbridge, the \nSmith Court reasoned that Congress accepted the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation. Forty years later, Camp \nfollowed Smith and applied the same rule for \ndefendants in diversity cases\u2014they all had to be \nfrom the same state. Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. \n \n16 Strawbridge was doubted by even the Great Chief \nJustice himself. See Louisville C. & C.R Co. v. Letson, 43 U.S. \n497, 555\u201356 (1844) (Wayne, J.) (\u201c[b]y no one was the correctness \nof [Strawbridge and its progeny] more questioned than by the \nlate chief justice who gave them\u201d). \n\n \n24 \n \n \nSmith and Camp are plainly irrelevant here.   \nFirst, Smith and Camp dealt with a restrictive \nprovision that is no longer on the books. See Smith, \n133 U.S. at 319 (noting that \u201cthe purpose of the \nlegislature [was] to restrict rather than to enlarge \nthe jurisdiction of the circuit courts\u201d). Indeed, \u201cmuch \nhas changed since the Court\u2019s ruling in Smith.\u201d \nSidney Coal Co. v. Massanari, 221 F. Supp. 2d 755, \n764 (E.D. Ky. 2002). \n\u201c[W]hen Smith was decided, \u2026 the venue statute \nin effect today did not exist.\u201d Zumft v. Doney Slate \nCo., 698 F. Supp. 444, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \u201cIn 1966, \nto cure the problem created where the residences of \nco-plaintiffs or co-defendants made the proper laying \nof venue impossible, a venue statute providing for \ncommencement of an action in the district where the \nclaim arose was passed.\u201d Id. (citing Brunette Machine \nWorks, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, \n710 n.8 (1972)). Under that new statute, \u201cdismissal is \nnot necessarily required where venue cannot be \npremised on the parties\u2019 citizenship.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, diversity cases can now be heard where the \nclaim arose\u2014thus negating the need to look at \nparties\u2019 \nresidences \naltogether \nin \nsome \ncases. \nMoreover, \u201cthe statute at issue in Smith was \nsuperceded in 1966 by Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406, which provided district courts some \nflexibility when making a venue determination.\u201d \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 n.12. Specifically, \n\u00a7 1406 \u201cgives district courts discretion to either \ndismiss an improperly venued case or \u2018if it be in the \ninterest of justice\u2019 to transfer such case to any \ndistrict or division in which the case could have been \ncommenced.\u201d Zumft, 698 F. Supp. at 446. In other \n\n \n25 \n \n \nwords, even when it comes to diversity cases now, \nSmith \nhas \nlimited \napplication \ngiven \nthese \nintervening legislative changes.17  \nSecond, and more importantly, Smith and Camp \ndealt with venue in diversity cases\u2014not cases \nagainst the federal government. When it came to \nsuits against federal officials, there is a long and \nunbroken history establishing that today only one \nplaintiff needs to establish venue. Before 1962, \u201cthe \nlaw on the proper place of suit for actions against \nfederal \nofficers \nand \nagencies \nwas \nquite \nunsatisfactory.\u201d Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. \nEssentially, most plaintiffs had to sue in the District \nof Columbia. Id. To cure this \u201cevil\u201d as some put it, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. TVA, 459 \nF.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1972), Congress added 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which was intended \u201cto broaden the \nvenue of civil actions which could previously have \nbeen brought only in the District of Columbia.\u201d \nSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 489 (1971); \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 344\u201345 & n.12; see Wright \n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. In particular, the new \nstatute allowed the plaintiff to sue where \u201cthe \nplaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). As court after \ncourt concluded, \u201cinterpreting the phrase \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019 to mean \u2018all plaintiffs\u2019 or \u2018each plaintiff\u2019 \n \n17 Even before Smith, this Court recognized that \u201c[i]t is \nnot denied that under the constitutional provision as to the \njudicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, \nhave given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases \nbetween citizens of one or more states on one side, and citizens \nof one or more other states on the other side.\u201d Louisville, C. & \nC.R. Co., 43 U.S. at 500\u201301.  \n\n \n26 \n \n \nwould substantially limit the statute\u2019s breadth and \nundermine congressional intent.\u201d Sidney Coal, 427 \nF.3d at 344 (collecting cases). \u201cEach court faced with \nthe same issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d Id. at 344\u2013\n45. \u201cThus, Smith has no bearing on this Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of\u201d venue provisions governing actions \nagainst the federal government. Id. at 345 n.12. \nThird, the statutory language at issue in Smith \nand Camp is different from the TCA\u2019s venue \nprovision. The provision in Smith and Camp said, \n\u201csuit shall be brought only in the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added). But there \nis no similarly restrictive language in the TCA\u2019s \nvenue provision. It allows \u201cany adversely affected \nperson\u201d to sue in the circuit \u201cin which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Thus, Smith and Camp have no \napplication here.  \nFDA also looks for support in secondary sources to \nargue that \u201c[the Supreme] Court long ago held that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.\u201d Pet. 13 \n(quoting 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. 2023)). But if \nthe Agency read on, it would find that Wright & \nMiller addresses this situation\u2014civil actions against \nfederal agencies\u2014and explains, as detailed above, \nthat \u201c[i]n cases involving multiple plaintiffs, venue is \nproper where any one of them resides.\u201d Wright & \nMiller, supra, at \u00a7 3815 (emphasis added). In short, \nFDA is without support for its position.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \n* * * \nThis Court has long observed that it is the \n\u201c\u2018plaintiff\u2019s venue privilege,\u2019\u201d not the defendant\u2019s\u2014\nand certainly not the federal government\u2019s, with its \nnational omnipresence. Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Ct. W. Dist. Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) \n(quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 635 \n(1964)). Nothing about the TCA\u2019s venue provision \ndisplaces that settled privilege. It neither prohibits \nretailers from seeking relief in their home circuits to \nvindicate their own interests independent of a \nmanufacturer nor prohibits a manufacturer from \njoining retailers in their properly filed petitions.  \nRespondent Avail was formed and has its principal \nplace of business in Texas, and Respondent \nMississippi Association is incorporated and has its \nprincipal place of business in Mississippi. FDA does \nnot dispute those facts. Thus, the Fifth Circuit was \ncorrect to hold that venue is proper in that circuit. \nSee 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nII. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT AND THE \nALLEGED \n\u201cEFFECTS\u201d \nARE \nINCREASINGLY \nRARE. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not only correct, but \nthere is also no circuit conflict over either of the \nissues presented by this case. Pet. 17. Moreover, the \n\u201ceffects\u201d that FDA laments are overblown because \nthe Agency can only identify three petitions out of \ndozens in the almost year and a half since the Vibe \ndecision that it contends \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u2013\n17; see generally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing \nOrders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \n\n \n28 \n \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024). \n1.  FDA admits that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \ndoes not create a circuit conflict about the meaning of \nthe TCA\u2019s venue provision.\u201d Id. The Fifth Circuit is \nthe first and only circuit court to have analyzed \nwhether a retailer has statutory standing to invoke \nthe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision and, as explained \nabove, its analysis falls squarely within this Court\u2019s \nestablished precedent. See supra pp. 7\u20139. Indeed, as \nexplained, it accords with the uniform decisions of \nthe federal courts in related contexts. See supra pp. \n16\u201320. \nNevertheless, FDA attempts to manufacture a \n\u201cconflict\u201d as to its (forfeited) alternative argument \nthat \neach \npetitioner \nmust \nestablish \nvenue \nindependently. Pet. 14. In so doing, FDA invokes a \nsingle case, Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal \nPower Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), \nwhich was decided forty-five years before the TCA \nwas even enacted. FDA claims that Amerada \nPetroleum held that \u201cout-of-circuit companies could \nnot join a local company to seek review in that \ncircuit.\u201d Pet. 14. That is wrong. In Amerada \nPetroleum, the Court was faced with \u201cseparate \napplications [to the federal agency] of natural-gas \ncompanies,\u201d only one of which was located in the \nTenth Circuit. Id. at 810 (emphasis added). Because \nthe statute clearly contemplated a separate \u201corder \nrelating to [each] particular natural-gas company,\u201d \neach company needed to bring its own suit over each \norder, and thus independently satisfy venue. See id. \nHere, by contrast, all Respondents are \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by FDA\u2019s single order on one application. 21 \n\n \n29 \n \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1); see supra pp. 9\u201314. And so the \ngeneral rule that only one plaintiff needs to have \nvenue applies. See supra pp. 16\u201320. \n2.  The purported \u201ceffects\u201d of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision are also no reason for this Court to step in. \nPet. 16.  \nFor all of FDA\u2019s hand-wringing about \u201c[o]ther out-\nof-circuit manufacturers \u2026 using the same tactic to \nobtain judicial review of FDA orders in the Fifth \nCircuit,\u201d one would expect many more petitions like \nthis one. Id. It has been almost a year and a half \nsince the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit,\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at 188, and FDA can only \nidentify three petitions out of dozens filed since then \nthat it claims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 17; see \ngenerally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing Orders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024).18  \nMoreover, while FDA has issued hundreds of \nthousands of denial orders, see Vibe, 65 F.4th at 192 \n(\u201c[FDA] has denied over 355,000 such applications.\u201d), \nFDA had made \u201cdeterminations on more than 99% \n \n18 FDA identifies three petitions for judicial review it \nclaims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u201317. There now appear to be \nthree more petitions for judicial review in the Fifth Circuit with \na retailer establishing venue. See NicQuid LLC v. FDA, No. 24-\n60272 (5th Cir. Jun. 3, 2024); Breeze Smoke, LLC v. FDA, No. \n24-60304 (5th Cir. Jun. 12, 2024); Vertigo Vapor v. FDA, No. 24-\n60332 (5th Cir. Jun. 28, 2024). At best then, FDA can point to \nonly six petitions for judicial review (other than the Vuse \npetitions) out of hundreds of thousands of denial orders.  \n\n \n30 \n \n \nof\u201d applications filed by the time Vibe was decided.19 \nAnd, under the statute, petitions must be filed thirty \ndays after a denial order. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a). \nThus, \nthere \nwill \nnot\u2014indeed, \ncannot\u2014be \nan \nonslaught of petitions filed in the Fifth Circuit. \nWhile it is true that new tobacco products must seek \nauthorization, FDA\u2019s onerous requirements for \nmarketing authorization have made it such that few \nmanufacturers can even attempt to comply. Put \nanother way, fewer applications will mean fewer \npetitions for judicial review. \nEqually misplaced are FDA\u2019s claims about the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201ccontribut[ing] to a \u2018youth \nvaping epidemic.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023)). As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision simply relates to which \ncourt may decide the case; it does not dictate the \ncorrect substantive result in any case, let alone \ncontribute to an epidemic. Moreover, youth use has \ndropped by more than 25% since 2022.20 And Vuse, \nwhile the leading e\u2011cigarette among adults, is not \npopular among youth, ranking behind brands like Elf \nBar (three times more popular among youth than \nVuse) and Esco Bars, and continues to decline.21 \n \n19 FDA, FDA Makes Determinations On More Than 99% \nof the 26 Million Tobacco Products For Which Applications Were \nSubmitted (Mar. 15, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/yxcf2dfm. \n20 FDA, National Survey Shows Drop in E-Cigarette Use \nAmong \nHigh \nSchool \nStudents \n(Nov. \n2, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3nn4tvar. \n21 See Jan Birdsey, et al., Tobacco Product Use Among \nU.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014National Youth \nTobacco Survey, 2023, 72 MMWR 1173 (Nov. 2023). \n\n \n31 \n \n \nIndeed, only 1.5% of middle and high school students \nreported using any Vuse product last year.22 FDA \ncannot credibly claim that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nis contributing to any supposed youth vaping \nepidemic. \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE. \nEven if the question presented were otherwise \nworthy of this Court\u2019s attention, this petition would \nbe an exceedingly poor vehicle for answering it. First, \nthe specific interlocutory posture of this case is \nhighly irregular, requiring this Court to become the \nfirst appellate court to review a procedural order \n(because the case was originally filed in the court of \nappeals) and the first court to review the second \n(forfeited) question. Second, even if FDA were to \nprevail on the venue issue in this Court, the case \nwould not be over.  \n1.  The interlocutory posture of this case makes \nthe petition highly irregular. The general rule is that \na district court\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer on venue grounds is not immediately \nappealable. See, e.g., Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, \n490 U.S. 495, 498 (1989) (venue); Van Cauwenberghe \nv. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 519 (1988) (forum non \nconveniens). And while a different statute governs \ncertiorari before judgment in cases pending at the \ncourt of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the government \ncites no on-point case in which this Court has ever \ngranted review of an interlocutory venue decision in \nthis procedural posture. \n \n22 Birdsey, et al., supra. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nInstead, the government points to four other cases \nthat it says support review of the interlocutory \ndecision \nbelow. \nBut \neach \nof \nthese \ncases \nis \ndistinguishable.  \nTC Heartland, Walden, and Atlantic Marine all \ninvolved cases where the court of appeals had \nentered a final order or judgment for purposes of the \nappeal before it. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods \nGrp. Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 263 (2017) \n(mandamus); Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 291 \n(2014) (judgment); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54 \n(mandamus). This case is a far cry from those, as the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision below merely entered an \ninterlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in a case filed in the court of appeals in the \nfirst instance.  \nThe closest the government comes is Mercantile \nNational Bank v. Langdeau. But that case analyzed \na prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, which lays out a \nseparate standard for certiorari review of final \njudgments from state courts. The Court held in that \nparticular case that \u00a7 1257 was satisfied because a \nstate supreme court had issued a final order on \nvenue, the only federal issue in the case\u2014and \npetitioner had made a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d that a \n\u201cfederal statute\u201d \u201cprohibit[ed] further proceedings \nagainst the defendants in the state court in which \nthe suit is now pending.\u201d 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963). In \nother words, the venue decision meant that the only \nfederal question had been addressed and it was thus \nsufficiently final for purposes of federal review. Here, \nhowever, this case remains pending in the Fifth \nCircuit and has not proceeded to final judgment. Pet. \n19 (conceding that \u201cno final judgment on the merits \n\n \n33 \n \n \nhas been entered\u201d). Unlike in Mercantile, there are a \nlitany of other federal issues that will be pressed and \npassed upon before final judgment, meaning that \nthis cannot be characterized as a final federal \njudgment. Cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 501 \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s interlocutory appeal to \nenforce a forum-selection clause \u201cdoes not fall \nwithin \u2026 the collateral order doctrine\u201d). \nAs to the second question, FDA\u2019s petition is even \nmore irregular. As noted above, FDA has forfeited \nthis issue; the Agency never presented its argument \nbefore the Fifth Circuit. See supra p. 16; Sachs, 577 \nU.S. at 37. Because the Fifth Circuit did not have the \nchance to pass upon the question, this Court would \neffectively be stepping in as the court of first review. \nFDA cites no case where this Court has granted \nreview under such circumstances. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not finally \nresolve this case. As even FDA concedes, the Fifth \nCircuit has not decided the merits or rendered final \njudgment. According to Rule 11, then, review is \npresumptively inappropriate. See Sup. Ct. R. 11. Yet \nthe \ngovernment \ndoes \nnot \nexplain \nwhy \nthe \ninterlocutory order addressing venue \u201cis of such \nimperative \npublic \nimportance \nas \nto \nrequire \nimmediate determination in this Court.\u201d Id. (citing \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(e)). That is particularly notable \nbecause \nFDA \nhas \nalready \nresolved \n99% \nof \napplications filed by September 9, 2020, and the time \nto challenge such denials has long since run. See \nsupra at p. 26. The universe of cases in which this \nissue can now arise is therefore tiny, and if it is as \nimportant as FDA claims, can be resolved after final \njudgment. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nIn addition, even if this Court concluded that \nretailers lack statutory standing, FDA would not be \nentitled to the result it seeks\u2014transfer or dismissal. \nVenue is not lost even if the party whose presence \nwas necessary for venue is dismissed from the case. \nSee, e.g., Exxon, 588 F.2d at 899; Horihan v. Hartford \nIns. Co., 979 F. Supp. 1073, 1076 (E.D. Tex. 1997). \nThe exception is where a party\u2019s claims are frivolous \nor joinder is fraudulent. See Wright & Miller, supra, \nat \u00a7 3815 n.40 (collecting cases). FDA does not \ncontend either here. Cf. B, Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., \n663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1981); Honey Holdings I, \nLtd. v. Alfred L. Wolff, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 3d 543, 558 \nn.16 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Nor could it, especially since \nthe Fifth Circuit has upheld retailers\u2019 rights to assert \nthe claims at issue.  \nFurther, if FDA were to prevail on its alternative \nargument (that each party must establish venue), \nthe case would still continue.23 At best for FDA, \nRJRV and RJR Vapor Co. would be dismissed from \nthe case. But that would not affect the retailers\u2019 case. \nAnd if the retailers are successful, the denial order \nwill \nbe \nvacated, \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthe \nmanufacturers are parties.  \nIn short, even if FDA were to prevail in this Court, \nthe case would neither be dismissed nor transferred.  \n \n23 This Court has granted review in FDA v.

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the Petitioner's (FDA's) brief on the merits provides a comprehensive and doctrinally rich articulation of their legal position, fundamentally reshaping my understanding of the case. My prior belief, formed in the absence of this brief and influenced by the lack of amicus support for the FDA, was that the government's legal argument was relatively weak and that the case was leaning in the Respondents' favor. This new observation corrects that assessment, revealing a sophisticated, multi-pronged legal strategy that brings the case back into a much more balanced and competitive posture.\n\nMy cumulative understanding, integrating this new, high-quality information, is now as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Significantly Clarified and Strengthened):** My previous characterization of the FDA's argument as a simple \"term of art\" claim was a significant oversimplification. The Solicitor General's brief articulates a much more formidable case grounded in core administrative law and civil procedure doctrines. The key arguments are:\n    *   **Zone of Interests Doctrine:** The FDA argues that retailers, even if economically harmed, fall outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the Tobacco Control Act's judicial review provision. The brief contends that the statute's focus is squarely on the relationship between the manufacturer-applicant and the agency. This argument relies on major administrative law precedents like *Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.* and *Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.*, reframing the debate from a simple textual question to a well-established test for prudential standing.\n    *   **Statutory Preclusion:** The brief argues that the structure of the statutory scheme implicitly precludes judicial review for anyone other than the applicant. By citing *Block v. Community Nutrition Institute*, a landmark case on this issue, the FDA suggests that Congress's detailed focus on the applicant throughout the premarket review process indicates an intent to limit challenges to that specific party. This provides a powerful counter-narrative to the Respondents' textualist arguments.\n    *   **Venue and Joinder as Independent Hurdles:** The FDA bifurcates the issue, arguing that even if retailers *can* sue, they cannot serve as a \"venue anchor\" for an out-of-circuit manufacturer like R.J. Reynolds. The brief asserts that traditional principles of venue and joinder require that venue must be proper for each petitioner individually. This provides the Court a narrower, alternative path to rule for the FDA by focusing on procedural rules rather than the broader question of who is \"adversely affected.\"\n    *   **Nullification of Venue Restrictions:** The brief culminates in the practical argument I had previously identified: that the Fifth Circuit's interpretation effectively nullifies the Act's venue limitations and invites rampant forum shopping by manufacturers. This argument now serves as the policy capstone to a series of robust legal and procedural claims.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Contextualized):** The Respondents' arguments, which I previously saw as dominant, are now situated within a more complex legal debate.\n    *   **Textual Argument (\"any person\"):** The plain-text reading of \"any person adversely affected\" remains a powerful argument. However, it is now directly challenged by the FDA's \"zone of interests\" and statutory preclusion arguments, which are established judicial doctrines for interpreting the scope of such broad statutory language.\n    *   **Structural Argument (*expressio unius*):** The argument that Congress knew how to limit review to applicants (as it did elsewhere in the statute) but chose not to here is still a strong point. However, the FDA's brief counters with its own structural argument, urging a holistic reading of the entire premarket application and review process (Section 387j) as being exclusively concerned with the applicant.\n    *   **Systemic Concerns (ALF Brief):** The concern that a narrow ruling would disrupt administrative law across many statutes remains relevant, but the FDA's reliance on foundational cases like *Block* and *Lexmark* suggests they believe their proposed interpretation is consistent with, not disruptive of, established administrative law principles.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has undergone a significant revision. The \"evidence of absence\" (lack of amicus support for the FDA) that previously weighed heavily in my analysis is now largely superseded by the direct evidence of the Solicitor General's powerful and doctrinally sound brief. The case is no longer a lopsided contest between strong textualism and a weaker institutional plea. It is now a classic Supreme Court administrative law dispute, pitting a broad textualist reading against a more contextual and structural interpretation that employs established limiting doctrines (zone of interests, preclusion) to achieve a specific practical outcome (preventing forum shopping). My prediction has shifted from \"leaning toward the Respondents\" back to \"highly balanced and too close to call,\" as the FDA has presented the Court with several plausible and well-supported paths to reversal.",

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Brief in Opposition to certiorari provides the critical counter-arguments to the FDA's position, adding significant depth and balance to my understanding of the legal landscape. My previous update, based on the FDA's merits brief, had shifted my belief from \"leaning Respondents\" to \"highly balanced,\" as I was impressed by the doctrinal sophistication of the government's \"zone of interests\" and statutory preclusion arguments. This new observation provides the Respondents' rebuttal, demonstrating that their position is equally grounded in established legal doctrine and not merely a simplistic textualist plea.\n\nMy cumulative understanding, now integrating the arguments from both sides, is as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable):** My understanding of the FDA's arguments remains unchanged. The government's case rests on a contextual and structural reading of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA), employing administrative law's limiting principles to argue that:\n    1.  Retailers fall outside the \"zone of interests\" of the premarket review provision, which is exclusively concerned with the manufacturer-applicant.\n    2.  The statutory scheme implicitly precludes review for non-applicants.\n    3.  Proper venue must be established for each petitioner individually, preventing a retailer from acting as a \"venue anchor.\"\n    4.  The Fifth Circuit's ruling invites forum shopping and nullifies the TCA's specific venue choices.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Significantly Clarified and Strengthened):** The Brief in Opposition fleshes out the Respondents' legal strategy, providing direct and powerful counters to the FDA's primary claims.\n    *   **Textual Argument Reinforced by \"Zone of Interests\" Counter:** The Respondents' argument begins with the \"expansive meaning\" of \"any person adversely affected,\" but it does not stop there. Crucially, it directly refutes the FDA's \"zone of interests\" argument by demonstrating that the TCA, as a whole, extensively regulates retailers. The brief points out that retailers are subject to numerous statutory obligations and potential penalties under the TCA (e.g., regarding sales, labeling, and distribution). The argument follows that if retailers are regulated parties under the Act, they are necessarily within its zone of interests when an agency order (the MDO) directly prohibits them from engaging in their business. This reframes the FDA's argument as an artificially narrow reading of the statute, focused only on the application section (Sec. 387j) rather than the entire Act.\n    *   **Joinder and Judicial Economy (Counter to Question 2):** The Respondents present a formidable argument on the second question regarding venue for joined parties. They argue that once one petitioner properly establishes venue (the in-circuit retailer), standard principles of joinder and judicial economy allow other proper parties (the manufacturer) to join the petition. Forcing the manufacturer and retailer to file separate challenges to the exact same agency order in different circuits would be inefficient and duplicative. This argument appeals to practical court administration, a factor the Supreme Court often considers.\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture (New, Potentially Decisive Point):** The Respondents introduce a powerful procedural argument: that the FDA *forfeited* its argument on the second question (that each petitioner must independently satisfy venue) by failing to raise it properly in the Fifth Circuit. If the Supreme Court agrees, it may decline to even consider the \"venue anchor\" question, which would be a major victory for the Respondents and could resolve a key part of the case on procedural grounds alone.\n    *   **Interlocutory Posture and Lack of Circuit Split:** While not a merits argument, the Respondents' emphasis on the case's procedural posture (an interlocutory appeal of a venue order with no circuit split) signals that they view the FDA's petition as weak on the Supreme Court's traditional criteria for granting review. This context suggests the underlying legal questions may not be as unsettled as the FDA claims.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved again. While the case remains a high-stakes administrative law dispute, the Respondents' brief has successfully leveled the playing field that the FDA's brief had tilted back to center. The contest is no longer just broad text vs. limiting doctrines. It is now a clash between two competing structural interpretations: the FDA's narrow focus on the application process versus the Respondents' holistic view of the entire regulatory scheme. Furthermore, the Respondents have introduced a strong judicial economy argument and a potentially dispositive procedural forfeiture argument on the second question. My prediction remains that the case is highly competitive, but the Respondents now appear to have more paths to victory. The Court could affirm the Fifth Circuit by adopting the Respondents' broader \"zone of interests\" analysis, or it could find for them on the narrower grounds of joinder and judicial economy, perhaps sidestepping the first question entirely by finding the FDA forfeited its argument on the second. The FDA's clearest path to victory remains convincing the Court that the \"zone of interests\" for this specific judicial review provision is narrowly tied only to the applicant.",

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C.

Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product.

Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n16: 20240703113830760_23-1187cos.json (score: 0.240)\nNo. 23-1187 \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ET AL., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nR.J.

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed.

Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d and \u201ca detrimental influence \non\u201d the retailer Respondents\u2019 interests, since they \ncannot sell the product at issue and if they do, will be \nsubject to severe penalties, see infra p. 12. Therefore, \nunder the plain text, retailer Respondents are \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s order. \nb. FDA tries to escape the statute\u2019s plain text by \nemphasizing that \u201c\u2018adversely affected\u2019 is a term of art \nin administrative law,\u201d Pet. 11, but the Agency fares \nno better under this Court\u2019s statutory standing \njurisprudence. The zone-of-interests test that this \nCourt has applied to determine when a party is \nsufficiently aggrieved to challenge agency action \u201cis \nnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). A party has \nstatutory standing if it asserts an interest that is \n\u201carguably\u201d protected or regulated by the statute. \nE.g., id. at 225\u201326. The zone-of-interests test \n\u201cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.\u201d Id. All that is required is \u201csome \nindicia\u2014however slight\u2014that the litigant before the \ncourt \nwas \n[(i)] intended \nto \nbe \nprotected \u2026 or \n[(ii)] regulated by the statute\u201d\u2014either suffices. \nCalumet Indus., Inc. v. Brock, 807 F.2d 225, 228 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986). This is assessed using \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory interpretation.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. \nv. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 197 (2017). And \u201cthe \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u201d Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225. \u201c[F]inancial \ninjury \u2026 satisf[ies] \nthe \n\u2018cause-of-action\u2019 \n(or \n\u2018prudential standing\u2019) requirement.\u201d Bank of Am., \n581 U.S. at 197. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Bank of America\u2014which \ninvolved a statute with virtually identical language \nabout who can sue\u2014controls this case. There, the \nCity of Miami sued several banks under the Fair \nHousing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), alleging that the banks \nengaged in discriminatory lending in the residential \nhousing market that caused the City economic harm. \nIn concluding that the City came within the FHA\u2019s \nzone of interests, the Supreme Court stressed the \ntextual \nbreadth \nof \nthe \nFHA\u2019s \njudicial-review \nprovision: \u201cThe FHA permits any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 \nto bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.\u201d Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)). Because the City \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclaimed that the banks\u2019 lending practices caused the \nCity\u2019s lost tax revenue, the Court concluded the City \nwas at least \u201carguably \u2026 within the FHA\u2019s zone of \ninterests\u201d\u2014even though the City did not suffer \ndiscrimination. Id. at 200\u201301.7 \nGiven this precedent, it is no wonder the Fifth \nCircuit rejected FDA\u2019s argument under the TCA. The \nstatutory language here\u2014\u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d\u2014is, if anything, broader than the FHA\u2019s \n\u201caggrieved person\u201d language. And the connection \nbetween the retailers\u2019 injuries and the interests \nprotected by the TCA is far more direct than the \nconnection between the City\u2019s lost tax revenue in \nBank of America and the FHA. This case thus follows \na fortiori from Bank of America. See also Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 144 S. Ct. 1414, 1423 \n(2024) (holding \u201can insurer such as Truck with \nfinancial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a \n\u2018party in interest\u2019 because it may be directly and \nadversely affected by the reorganization plan\u201d).8  \n \n7 Notably, the government filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of the position this Court adopted. See Brief for U.S. as \nAmicus Curiae Supporting Respondent, Bank of America, 581 \nU.S. 189, 2016 WL 5903233. \n8 The retailers\u2019 interests would establish standing even \nunder Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion in Bank of America. \nJustice Thomas concluded that the City\u2019s asserted injuries (lost \nrevenues and increased costs) did not implicate the interests \nprotected by the FHA. 581 U.S. at 207\u201309. (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part, dissenting in part). Here, there is no \nquestion that the retailers\u2019 injuries (inability to sell a tobacco \nproduct) directly implicate the interests protected by the TCA. \nSee infra p. 12. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nc. \nThis \nstraightforward \ninterpretation \nof \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), moreover, is confirmed by the structure \nof the TCA and statutory context. FDA seems to \nassert that, in allowing \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d to sue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded), Congress actually meant that \u201conly a \nmanufacturer of a product subject to a marketing \ndenial order\u201d or \u201conly an applicant whose premarket \napplication is denied\u201d could sue. But Congress knows \nhow to limit judicial-review provisions in that way, \nand, indeed, did so elsewhere in the TCA itself. \nCompare id. (\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may \nchallenge marketing denial orders for tobacco \nproducts), with id. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) (\u201c[t]he holder of an \napplication\u201d may challenge the withdrawal of \nmarketing authorization for tobacco products). For \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), in contrast, it uses the capacious phrase \n\u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d And \u201c[w]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order 4\u20135 \n(Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 \nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)); see also id. at 5 (\u201cCongress did \nnot limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those \nchallenging a withdrawal order. If the FDA disagrees \nwith Congress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the \n[TCA], its concerns are better directed to Congress \nthan to this court.\u201d). \nCongress also included rulemaking in the TCA\u2019s \njudicial-review provision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (\u201cany \nperson adversely affected by such regulation\u201d \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(emphasis added)). Under FDA\u2019s interpretation, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d would thus mean two \ndifferent \nthings \nin \nthe \nsame \nprovision: \nfor \nrulemaking, \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d means \n\u201cany person adversely affected,\u201d but for a denial \norder, \u201cany person adversely affect\u201d means \u201conly the \nadversely affected manufacturer.\u201d Basic interpretive \nrules reject such a reading. In a given statute, there \nis a presumption of consistent usage: the same term \nusually has the same meaning across different \napplications. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (\u201cTo give these same words [in a statutory \nphrase] a different meaning for each category would \nbe to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d). \nThe evidence that Congress meant what it said \ndoes not stop with the TCA. The U.S. Code is replete \nwith provisions that, unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1) here, \nexpressly limit the class of potential petitioners to \nparties who either played some specific role in the \nadministrative proceedings or satisfy other specified \ncriteria. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1047 (\u201cthe affected \napplicant\u201d) (emphasis added); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4634 (\u201cAny \nparty to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added); 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3247 (\u201cany party to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis \nadded); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (\u201cAny recipient which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 6869 (\u201cIf any \napplicant is dissatisfied\u201d) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 228b-3 (\u201cthe live poultry dealer\u201d) (emphasis added); \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189 (\u201cthe designated organization\u201d) \n(emphasis added); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (\u201cA person who is \nthe primary next of kin\u201d) (emphasis added); 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6717 (\u201cA unit of general local government which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 \n(\u201ca party\u201d to the order) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 7107 \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(\u201ca contractor\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263b (\u201cthe owner or \noperator\u201d) (emphasis added). \nA retailer thus easily falls within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. Bank of Am., 581 U.S. at 197 \n(\u201cclaims of financial injury \u2026 satisfy \u2026 \u2018prudential \nstanding\u2019\u201d). \nd. Looking at the statute more broadly reinforces \nthat retailers are within the zone of interests of both \nthe TCA as a whole and its premarket review \nprovisions in particular. Assessing this question, \ncourts generally ask whether the relevant statute \nregulates or protects the party. Calumet Indus., 807 \nF.2d at 228 (citing Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. \nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). If the \nstatute does, then the party is within the zone and \nhas statutory standing. Here, it is clear that the TCA \nboth regulates and protects retailers.  \nFirst, the TCA directly regulates retailers by: \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nthat FDA does not authorize, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 331, 387b(6); \n\u2022 authorizing seizures, fines, injunctions, and \ncriminal penalties against retailers who sell \nunauthorized products, id. \u00a7 334(a), (g); \n\u00a7 333(a), (f)(9)(A); \u00a7 332(a); \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nwith unauthorized \u201cmodified risk\u201d claims, \nid. \u00a7 387k(a); \n\u2022 requiring retailers to limit the location and \namount of any distribution of free samples \nof tobacco products, id. \u00a7 387a-1(d); \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any cigarette \nadvertisements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; and \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any smokeless \ntobacco product advertisements, id. \u00a7 4402.  \nAmong these numerous provisions, it is notable \nthat a denial order under the TCA dictates what \nproducts a retailer may sell. And FDA\u2019s enforcement \nefforts show that the statute means what it says. In \nannouncing its denial orders for menthol Vuse Vibe \nand Ciro, for example, FDA said that it \u201cintends to \nensure compliance by distributors and retailers.\u201d9 \nSimilarly, in announcing its denial order for menthol \nVuse Alto, FDA stated, \u201cIf the product is already on \nthe market, it must be removed from the market or \nrisk FDA enforcement.\u201d10 Moreover, in 2020, FDA \nwarned retailers it would enforce the TCA against \nthem.11 FDA has made good on that threat, issuing \nwarning letters and civil penalties to retailers who \nsold \nproducts \nthat \nreceived \nmarketing \ndenial \n \n9 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Two Vuse \nMenthol E-Cigarette Products Following Determination They Do \nNot \nMeet \nPublic \nHealth \nStandard \n(Jan. \n24, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4ck9644b (emphasis added). \n10 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Six Flavored \nVuse \nAlto \nE-Cigarette \nProducts \n(Oct. \n12, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5n8nb7c7. \n11 E.g., FDA, FDA Warns Manufacturers and Retailers \n(Apr. 27, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/uttfu7p7 (\u201cIf the recipients \nof these warning letters do not cease the manufacture, \ndistribution and/or sale of these unauthorized tobacco products, \nthey risk additional FDA action such as an injunction, seizure \nand/or civil money penalty actions.\u201d). \n\n \n15 \n \n \norders.12 Just this March, FDA announced that it \nhad issued warning letters to 61 retailers for selling \nunauthorized tobacco products.13 FDA also has \nsought and obtained injunctions against retailers. \nE.g., Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, \nUnited States v. Lucky Convenience & Tobacco, LLC, \nNo. 6:22-cv-1237 (D. Kan. Jan. 26, 2023). The TCA \nthus obviously regulates tobacco retailers.  \nSecond, the TCA also directly protects retailers by: \n\u2022 preserving retailers\u2019 ability to sell tobacco \nproducts by forbidding FDA from banning \nall cigarettes and certain other product \ncategories, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f; \n\u2022 providing retailers with an opportunity for a \nhearing prior to a no-tobacco-sale order, id. \n\u00a7 333(f)(8); \n\u2022 providing retailers with several procedural \nprotections \nregarding \ncertain \nalleged \nviolations of the Act, id. \u00a7 333 note; and \n\u2022 exempting \nretailers \nfrom \ncertain \nrecordkeeping \nrequirements, \nid. \n\u00a7 387t(b)(5). \nSignificantly for assessing whether retailers fall \nwithin the TCA\u2019s zone of interests, the Act expressly \ndeclares Congress\u2019s purpose \u201cto continue to permit \nthe sale of tobacco products to adults,\u201d including \n \n12 FDA, Advisory and Enforcement Actions Against \nIndustry \nfor \nUnauthorized \nTobacco \nProducts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mrxxt3ja (last visited July 2, 2024). \n13 FDA, FDA Warns 61 Brick and Mortar Retailers for \nthe Sale of Unauthorized E-Cigarettes Popular Among Youth \n(Mar. 26, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mpx2bjky. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nthrough retailers who comply with the TCA. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387 note. FDA cannot seriously maintain \nthat retailers like Respondents Avail, Mississippi \nAssociation, and RJR Vapor Co. L.L.C. fall outside \nthe Act\u2019s zone of interests when those entities are a \nconstant and integral subject of the Act\u2019s provisions. \ne. \nFor its part, FDA argues that \u201caspects of the \nstatutory structure demonstrate that the denial of a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application does not adversely affect \na seller.\u201d Pet. 11. But FDA only points to two \n(inapposite) provisions. The first provision is 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), where Congress provided that \nonly \u201cthe holder of an application\u201d may challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization. As noted \nabove, that provision cuts against FDA because \n\u201cCongress did not limit access to the courts for \nchallenging a denial order in the same way it did for \nthose challenging a withdrawal order.\u201d Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 5 (Feb. 2, 2024). This provision thus \ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to limit \njudicial review when it wanted to, and yet for the \ndenial of a premarket tobacco product application, \nauthorized a challenge by \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by it. See supra pp. 9\u201311. The second \nprovision to which FDA points is \u00a7 387f(c), where \nCongress \nlimited non-manufacturers\u2019 \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninformation \nunder \nthe \nFreedom \nof \nInformation Act. That provision, however, says \nnothing about\u2014and certainly does not contradict\u2014\nthe provision allowing judicial review by \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d Nor does FDA address the \nnumerous provisions that show beyond doubt that \nthe TCA regulates and protects retailers. See supra \npp. 12\u201314. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFDA\u2019s other counterarguments fare no better. FDA \nargues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cnullifies the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions.\u201d Pet. 15. According to FDA, \nthat is because a manufacturer can always find a \nretailer in a preferred circuit and sue there, rather \nthan in the manufacturer\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. \nCircuit. Even if so, the remedy would lie with \nCongress; FDA\u2019s argument does not authorize courts \nto ignore the statute\u2019s plain text. See SAS Inst. Inc. \nv. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1358 (2018) (\u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d).  \nFDA\u2019s argument is, in any event, wrong because \nthe fact that a manufacturer and some retailers may \njoin in a single petition does not render the Act\u2019s \nvenue restrictions a nullity. Venue must still be \nestablished. One petitioner must be located in the \nrelevant circuit unless it is the D.C. Circuit. See \nOrder Granting Mot. to Transfer, Shenzhen Yibo v. \nFDA, No. 24-60191 (5th Cir. May 20, 2024) (granting \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer Shenzhen Yibo\u2019s petition to \nthe D.C. Circuit because there was no local \nretailer).14 In addition, a manufacturer whose \nproducts are only sold in one area of the country \ncannot file wherever the manufacturer wants \nbecause retailers outside that one area would not be \nable to allege injuries in fact. For example, a \nVermont manufacturer that sells its own products \n(as many vape shops do) and is incorporated and \noperates only in Vermont cannot file a petition in the \n \n14 There undoubtedly will be cases where there will not \nbe a retailer who sells or wants to sell the denied product\u2014or at \nleast who is not motivated to pursue litigation. \n\n \n18 \n \n \nFifth Circuit. The venue provision thus operates to \nlimit available forums in that sort of case. But the \nTCA does not entirely shut out of court adversely \naffected retailers that wish to petition in their home \ncircuit. Indeed, under FDA\u2019s theory, a retailer could \nnever challenge a denial order\u2014a position that \nplainly conflicts with the statutory text.  \n2.  FDA poses an alternative argument, but it, too, \nmisses the mark. FDA argues that each petitioner \nmust independently establish venue, so that even if \nAvail and the Mississippi Association have statutory \nstanding and can establish venue, RJRV (which \nconcededly \nhas \nstatutory \nstanding) \nmay \nnot \nparticipate in the case but, instead, must file a \nseparate case in a different court challenging the \nsame denial order. Pet. 12\u201314. This argument is both \nforfeited and wrong. \na. \nAs an initial matter, FDA never advanced this \nargument below. While FDA did object to venue \nrepeatedly in the Fifth Circuit, FDA\u2019s argument was \nthat retailers could not sue at all under the TCA, and \nthat without them venue was not proper. FDA did \nnot, however, argue that each petitioner needed to \nindependently establish venue. That argument \nappeared nowhere in FDA\u2019s Motion to Transfer. It \nappeared \nnowhere \nin \nFDA\u2019s \nOpposition \nto \nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Stay. And it appeared \nnowhere in FDA\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc of \nthe Vibe stay order (or in any other filing). Because \nthis argument \u201cwas never presented to any lower \ncourt,\u201d it is \u201cforfeited.\u201d OBB Personenverkehr AG v. \nSachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 (2015); see also Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \n\n \n19 \n \n \nb. \nIn any event, FDA is wrong. Nothing in the \nstatutory language requires each petitioner to \nindividually establish venue. To the contrary, \nCongress enacted the TCA\u2019s venue provision against \na long-standing backdrop of similarly worded venue \nprovisions governing suits against the government, \nwhich federal courts have uniformly interpreted to \nmean that venue needs to be proper for only one \npetitioner or plaintiff.  \nThe Hobbs Act governs review in the courts of \nappeals of certain actions by a number of federal \nagencies. In language that clearly served as a model \nfor the TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision, the Hobbs \nAct provides that venue shall be \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its \nprincipal office\u201d (or in the D.C. Circuit). 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2343. Courts have uniformly interpreted this \nlanguage to mean that, as long as one petitioner \nresides or has its principal place of business within \nthe circuit, venue is proper for all petitioners. See, \ne.g., Global Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 \nn.1 (5th Cir. 1982); Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 549 F.2d 1186, 1187 n.1 (8th Cir. \n1977); Radio Relay Corp. v.

For over five decades, federal courts \n\n \n20 \n \n \nhave uniformly interpreted that provision to mean \nthat venue can be established by any plaintiff. \nSidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, \n344\u201345 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cEach court faced with the \nsame issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d) (citing \ncases). The government agrees. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Civil Resource Manual 41 Venue (\u201cOnly one \nof the plaintiffs need reside in the district for venue \nto be proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(3).\u201d), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/58msjksk.15 \nThe TCA was enacted in 2009 against this \nlegislative backdrop. \u201cWhen administrative and \njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of \nan existing statutory provision, repetition of the \nsame language in a new statute indicates, as a \ngeneral matter, the intent to incorporate its \nadministrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201d \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). Thus, \nCongress did not intend for each petitioner to have to \nestablish venue individually under the TCA. Instead, \nif venue is proper for any one of the petitioners, then \nthe TCA\u2019s venue requirement is satisfied.   \n \n15 DOJ\u2019s Manual appears to have a typo\u2014the correct \nreference is \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393(e)(4),\u201d not (e)(3). Nonetheless, the \nstatute was amended in 2011 (after the manual was published), \nat which point \u00a7 1391(e)(4) became \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). The relevant \nlanguage remains the same. Federal Courts Jurisdiction and \nVenue Clarification Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-63, 125 Stat. \n758 (eff. Dec. 7, 2011).  \n\n \n21 \n \n \nThis longstanding and uniform interpretation, \nmoreover, \nmakes \nsense. \nOtherwise, \ndifferent \npetitioners would have to file separate lawsuits in \ndifferent courts challenging the same agency action. \nIndeed, in some situations, there could be a petition \nin every regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit. While \nthose petitions would be assigned to one circuit \neventually, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), there is no \nreason to force litigants and the court system to \nengage in this meaningless kabuki dance. When \nparties coordinate and file a single petition, it saves \neveryone time and resources (including FDA, which \nwill only have to respond to one petition). See Exxon \nCorp. v. FTC, 588 F.2d 895, 898\u201399 (3d Cir. 1978) \n(\u201c[R]equiring every plaintiff in an action against the \nfederal \ngovernment \nor \nan \nagent \nthereof \nto \nindependently meet section 1391(e)\u2019s standards \nwould result in an unnecessary multiplicity of \nlitigation. The language of the statute itself \nmandates no such narrow construction. There is no \nrequirement that all plaintiffs reside in the forum \ndistrict.\u201d), overruled on other grounds, Reifer v. \nWestport Ins. Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014); see \nalso Sidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 (collecting cases); \nQuarles v. Gen\u2019l Inv. & Dev. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n12 (D.D.C. 2003) (citing Exxon and finding that \nsection \n1391 \ncontains \n\u201ca \nfar \nless \nrestrictive \nrequirement\u201d than other venue statutes given the \nproblems inherent in suing government entities); Ry. \nLabor Execs.\u2019 Ass\u2019n v.

The \nstatute expressly contemplates that an improper \ndenial order will be \u201cset[ ] aside.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(c). \nSo even if the manufacturer and retailer were to file \nseparate petitions to have a denial order set aside, \nthe end result (if either prevails) would be the same. \nAs such, there is no sensible reason to force the \nmanufacturer and retailer to sue in different forums. \nConversely, FDA\u2019s interpretation does not make \nsense because it would not even solve the problem \nthat FDA purports to identify. A retailer, for \nexample, could challenge a denial order for a product \nthat it sells in its home circuit within ten days of the \ndenial order. Then, after those ten days but before \nexpiration of the thirty-day statute of limitations, a \nmanufacturer could challenge the same denial order \nin its home circuit. The result: both petitions would \nbe consolidated in the court in which the retailer \nfiled, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, thus (i) landing the case \nwhere FDA (erroneously) claims it does not belong, \nand (ii) multiplying the work of the appellate courts. \nBecause nothing in the Act requires each \npetitioner \nchallenging \na \ndenial \norder \nto \nindependently establish venue, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision was correct. See Alto C.A. Amended Order \n(Feb. 2, 2024).  \nc. \nAttempting to support its (forfeited) venue-as-\nto-each-petitioner argument, FDA relies on two, \ncentury-old cases interpreting irrelevant statutes. \nSee Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890); Camp v. \nGress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). Neither case helps FDA.  \n\n \n23 \n \n \nIn both cases, the statute provided, \u201c[W]here the \njurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the \naction is between citizens of different states, suit \nshall be brought only in the district of the residence \nof either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d Smith, 133 \nU.S. at 317; Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. In Smith, two \nplaintiffs, one from Arkansas and one from Missouri, \nsued a Texan. The Court held that venue under the \ndiversity-jurisdiction provision was lacking because \nthe two plaintiffs were not from the same state. See \nid. (holding that the statute \u201cmakes no provision in \nterms for the case of two defendants or two plaintiffs \nwho are citizens of different states\u201d). In so holding, \nthe Smith Court looked to Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \nopinion in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, which established \nthe \ncomplete \ndiversity \nrule\u2014for \ndiversity \njurisdiction, no plaintiff can be from the same state \nas any defendant. 3 Cranch 267 (1806). Whatever the \nwisdom of that rule and Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \ninterpretation of the venue provision,16 the Court \nconsistently applied it when interpreting that venue \nstatute governing diversity jurisdiction; because \nCongress (in 1890) had not legislatively changed the \nrelevant language interpreted by Strawbridge, the \nSmith Court reasoned that Congress accepted the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation. Forty years later, Camp \nfollowed Smith and applied the same rule for \ndefendants in diversity cases\u2014they all had to be \nfrom the same state. Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. \n \n16 Strawbridge was doubted by even the Great Chief \nJustice himself. See Louisville C. & C.R Co. v. Letson, 43 U.S. \n497, 555\u201356 (1844) (Wayne, J.) (\u201c[b]y no one was the correctness \nof [Strawbridge and its progeny] more questioned than by the \nlate chief justice who gave them\u201d). \n\n \n24 \n \n \nSmith and Camp are plainly irrelevant here.   \nFirst, Smith and Camp dealt with a restrictive \nprovision that is no longer on the books. See Smith, \n133 U.S. at 319 (noting that \u201cthe purpose of the \nlegislature [was] to restrict rather than to enlarge \nthe jurisdiction of the circuit courts\u201d). Indeed, \u201cmuch \nhas changed since the Court\u2019s ruling in Smith.\u201d \nSidney Coal Co. v. Massanari, 221 F. Supp. 2d 755, \n764 (E.D. Ky. 2002). \n\u201c[W]hen Smith was decided, \u2026 the venue statute \nin effect today did not exist.\u201d Zumft v. Doney Slate \nCo., 698 F. Supp. 444, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \u201cIn 1966, \nto cure the problem created where the residences of \nco-plaintiffs or co-defendants made the proper laying \nof venue impossible, a venue statute providing for \ncommencement of an action in the district where the \nclaim arose was passed.\u201d Id. (citing Brunette Machine \nWorks, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, \n710 n.8 (1972)). Under that new statute, \u201cdismissal is \nnot necessarily required where venue cannot be \npremised on the parties\u2019 citizenship.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, diversity cases can now be heard where the \nclaim arose\u2014thus negating the need to look at \nparties\u2019 \nresidences \naltogether \nin \nsome \ncases. \nMoreover, \u201cthe statute at issue in Smith was \nsuperceded in 1966 by Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406, which provided district courts some \nflexibility when making a venue determination.\u201d \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 n.12. Specifically, \n\u00a7 1406 \u201cgives district courts discretion to either \ndismiss an improperly venued case or \u2018if it be in the \ninterest of justice\u2019 to transfer such case to any \ndistrict or division in which the case could have been \ncommenced.\u201d Zumft, 698 F. Supp. at 446. In other \n\n \n25 \n \n \nwords, even when it comes to diversity cases now, \nSmith \nhas \nlimited \napplication \ngiven \nthese \nintervening legislative changes.17  \nSecond, and more importantly, Smith and Camp \ndealt with venue in diversity cases\u2014not cases \nagainst the federal government. When it came to \nsuits against federal officials, there is a long and \nunbroken history establishing that today only one \nplaintiff needs to establish venue. Before 1962, \u201cthe \nlaw on the proper place of suit for actions against \nfederal \nofficers \nand \nagencies \nwas \nquite \nunsatisfactory.\u201d Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. \nEssentially, most plaintiffs had to sue in the District \nof Columbia. Id. To cure this \u201cevil\u201d as some put it, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. TVA, 459 \nF.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1972), Congress added 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which was intended \u201cto broaden the \nvenue of civil actions which could previously have \nbeen brought only in the District of Columbia.\u201d \nSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 489 (1971); \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 344\u201345 & n.12; see Wright \n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. In particular, the new \nstatute allowed the plaintiff to sue where \u201cthe \nplaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). As court after \ncourt concluded, \u201cinterpreting the phrase \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019 to mean \u2018all plaintiffs\u2019 or \u2018each plaintiff\u2019 \n \n17 Even before Smith, this Court recognized that \u201c[i]t is \nnot denied that under the constitutional provision as to the \njudicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, \nhave given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases \nbetween citizens of one or more states on one side, and citizens \nof one or more other states on the other side.\u201d Louisville, C. & \nC.R. Co., 43 U.S. at 500\u201301.  \n\n \n26 \n \n \nwould substantially limit the statute\u2019s breadth and \nundermine congressional intent.\u201d Sidney Coal, 427 \nF.3d at 344 (collecting cases). \u201cEach court faced with \nthe same issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d Id. at 344\u2013\n45. \u201cThus, Smith has no bearing on this Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of\u201d venue provisions governing actions \nagainst the federal government. Id. at 345 n.12. \nThird, the statutory language at issue in Smith \nand Camp is different from the TCA\u2019s venue \nprovision. The provision in Smith and Camp said, \n\u201csuit shall be brought only in the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added). But there \nis no similarly restrictive language in the TCA\u2019s \nvenue provision. It allows \u201cany adversely affected \nperson\u201d to sue in the circuit \u201cin which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Thus, Smith and Camp have no \napplication here.  \nFDA also looks for support in secondary sources to \nargue that \u201c[the Supreme] Court long ago held that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.\u201d Pet. 13 \n(quoting 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. 2023)). But if \nthe Agency read on, it would find that Wright & \nMiller addresses this situation\u2014civil actions against \nfederal agencies\u2014and explains, as detailed above, \nthat \u201c[i]n cases involving multiple plaintiffs, venue is \nproper where any one of them resides.\u201d Wright & \nMiller, supra, at \u00a7 3815 (emphasis added). In short, \nFDA is without support for its position.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \n* * * \nThis Court has long observed that it is the \n\u201c\u2018plaintiff\u2019s venue privilege,\u2019\u201d not the defendant\u2019s\u2014\nand certainly not the federal government\u2019s, with its \nnational omnipresence. Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Ct. W. Dist. Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) \n(quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 635 \n(1964)). Nothing about the TCA\u2019s venue provision \ndisplaces that settled privilege. It neither prohibits \nretailers from seeking relief in their home circuits to \nvindicate their own interests independent of a \nmanufacturer nor prohibits a manufacturer from \njoining retailers in their properly filed petitions.  \nRespondent Avail was formed and has its principal \nplace of business in Texas, and Respondent \nMississippi Association is incorporated and has its \nprincipal place of business in Mississippi. FDA does \nnot dispute those facts. Thus, the Fifth Circuit was \ncorrect to hold that venue is proper in that circuit. \nSee 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nII. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT AND THE \nALLEGED \n\u201cEFFECTS\u201d \nARE \nINCREASINGLY \nRARE. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not only correct, but \nthere is also no circuit conflict over either of the \nissues presented by this case. Pet. 17. Moreover, the \n\u201ceffects\u201d that FDA laments are overblown because \nthe Agency can only identify three petitions out of \ndozens in the almost year and a half since the Vibe \ndecision that it contends \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u2013\n17; see generally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing \nOrders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \n\n \n28 \n \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024). \n1.  FDA admits that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \ndoes not create a circuit conflict about the meaning of \nthe TCA\u2019s venue provision.\u201d Id. The Fifth Circuit is \nthe first and only circuit court to have analyzed \nwhether a retailer has statutory standing to invoke \nthe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision and, as explained \nabove, its analysis falls squarely within this Court\u2019s \nestablished precedent. See supra pp. 7\u20139. Indeed, as \nexplained, it accords with the uniform decisions of \nthe federal courts in related contexts. See supra pp. \n16\u201320. \nNevertheless, FDA attempts to manufacture a \n\u201cconflict\u201d as to its (forfeited) alternative argument \nthat \neach \npetitioner \nmust \nestablish \nvenue \nindependently. Pet. 14. In so doing, FDA invokes a \nsingle case, Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal \nPower Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), \nwhich was decided forty-five years before the TCA \nwas even enacted. FDA claims that Amerada \nPetroleum held that \u201cout-of-circuit companies could \nnot join a local company to seek review in that \ncircuit.\u201d Pet. 14. That is wrong. In Amerada \nPetroleum, the Court was faced with \u201cseparate \napplications [to the federal agency] of natural-gas \ncompanies,\u201d only one of which was located in the \nTenth Circuit. Id. at 810 (emphasis added). Because \nthe statute clearly contemplated a separate \u201corder \nrelating to [each] particular natural-gas company,\u201d \neach company needed to bring its own suit over each \norder, and thus independently satisfy venue. See id. \nHere, by contrast, all Respondents are \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by FDA\u2019s single order on one application. 21 \n\n \n29 \n \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1); see supra pp. 9\u201314. And so the \ngeneral rule that only one plaintiff needs to have \nvenue applies. See supra pp. 16\u201320. \n2.  The purported \u201ceffects\u201d of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision are also no reason for this Court to step in. \nPet. 16.  \nFor all of FDA\u2019s hand-wringing about \u201c[o]ther out-\nof-circuit manufacturers \u2026 using the same tactic to \nobtain judicial review of FDA orders in the Fifth \nCircuit,\u201d one would expect many more petitions like \nthis one. Id. It has been almost a year and a half \nsince the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit,\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at 188, and FDA can only \nidentify three petitions out of dozens filed since then \nthat it claims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 17; see \ngenerally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing Orders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024).18  \nMoreover, while FDA has issued hundreds of \nthousands of denial orders, see Vibe, 65 F.4th at 192 \n(\u201c[FDA] has denied over 355,000 such applications.\u201d), \nFDA had made \u201cdeterminations on more than 99% \n \n18 FDA identifies three petitions for judicial review it \nclaims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u201317. There now appear to be \nthree more petitions for judicial review in the Fifth Circuit with \na retailer establishing venue. See NicQuid LLC v. FDA, No. 24-\n60272 (5th Cir. Jun. 3, 2024); Breeze Smoke, LLC v. FDA, No. \n24-60304 (5th Cir. Jun. 12, 2024); Vertigo Vapor v. FDA, No. 24-\n60332 (5th Cir. Jun. 28, 2024). At best then, FDA can point to \nonly six petitions for judicial review (other than the Vuse \npetitions) out of hundreds of thousands of denial orders.  \n\n \n30 \n \n \nof\u201d applications filed by the time Vibe was decided.19 \nAnd, under the statute, petitions must be filed thirty \ndays after a denial order. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a). \nThus, \nthere \nwill \nnot\u2014indeed, \ncannot\u2014be \nan \nonslaught of petitions filed in the Fifth Circuit. \nWhile it is true that new tobacco products must seek \nauthorization, FDA\u2019s onerous requirements for \nmarketing authorization have made it such that few \nmanufacturers can even attempt to comply. Put \nanother way, fewer applications will mean fewer \npetitions for judicial review. \nEqually misplaced are FDA\u2019s claims about the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201ccontribut[ing] to a \u2018youth \nvaping epidemic.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023)). As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision simply relates to which \ncourt may decide the case; it does not dictate the \ncorrect substantive result in any case, let alone \ncontribute to an epidemic. Moreover, youth use has \ndropped by more than 25% since 2022.20 And Vuse, \nwhile the leading e\u2011cigarette among adults, is not \npopular among youth, ranking behind brands like Elf \nBar (three times more popular among youth than \nVuse) and Esco Bars, and continues to decline.21 \n \n19 FDA, FDA Makes Determinations On More Than 99% \nof the 26 Million Tobacco Products For Which Applications Were \nSubmitted (Mar. 15, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/yxcf2dfm. \n20 FDA, National Survey Shows Drop in E-Cigarette Use \nAmong \nHigh \nSchool \nStudents \n(Nov. \n2, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3nn4tvar. \n21 See Jan Birdsey, et al., Tobacco Product Use Among \nU.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014National Youth \nTobacco Survey, 2023, 72 MMWR 1173 (Nov. 2023). \n\n \n31 \n \n \nIndeed, only 1.5% of middle and high school students \nreported using any Vuse product last year.22 FDA \ncannot credibly claim that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nis contributing to any supposed youth vaping \nepidemic. \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE. \nEven if the question presented were otherwise \nworthy of this Court\u2019s attention, this petition would \nbe an exceedingly poor vehicle for answering it. First, \nthe specific interlocutory posture of this case is \nhighly irregular, requiring this Court to become the \nfirst appellate court to review a procedural order \n(because the case was originally filed in the court of \nappeals) and the first court to review the second \n(forfeited) question. Second, even if FDA were to \nprevail on the venue issue in this Court, the case \nwould not be over.  \n1.  The interlocutory posture of this case makes \nthe petition highly irregular. The general rule is that \na district court\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer on venue grounds is not immediately \nappealable. See, e.g., Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, \n490 U.S. 495, 498 (1989) (venue); Van Cauwenberghe \nv. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 519 (1988) (forum non \nconveniens). And while a different statute governs \ncertiorari before judgment in cases pending at the \ncourt of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the government \ncites no on-point case in which this Court has ever \ngranted review of an interlocutory venue decision in \nthis procedural posture. \n \n22 Birdsey, et al., supra. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nInstead, the government points to four other cases \nthat it says support review of the interlocutory \ndecision \nbelow. \nBut \neach \nof \nthese \ncases \nis \ndistinguishable.  \nTC Heartland, Walden, and Atlantic Marine all \ninvolved cases where the court of appeals had \nentered a final order or judgment for purposes of the \nappeal before it. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods \nGrp. Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 263 (2017) \n(mandamus); Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 291 \n(2014) (judgment); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54 \n(mandamus). This case is a far cry from those, as the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision below merely entered an \ninterlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in a case filed in the court of appeals in the \nfirst instance.  \nThe closest the government comes is Mercantile \nNational Bank v. Langdeau. But that case analyzed \na prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, which lays out a \nseparate standard for certiorari review of final \njudgments from state courts. The Court held in that \nparticular case that \u00a7 1257 was satisfied because a \nstate supreme court had issued a final order on \nvenue, the only federal issue in the case\u2014and \npetitioner had made a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d that a \n\u201cfederal statute\u201d \u201cprohibit[ed] further proceedings \nagainst the defendants in the state court in which \nthe suit is now pending.\u201d 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963). In \nother words, the venue decision meant that the only \nfederal question had been addressed and it was thus \nsufficiently final for purposes of federal review. Here, \nhowever, this case remains pending in the Fifth \nCircuit and has not proceeded to final judgment. Pet. \n19 (conceding that \u201cno final judgment on the merits \n\n \n33 \n \n \nhas been entered\u201d). Unlike in Mercantile, there are a \nlitany of other federal issues that will be pressed and \npassed upon before final judgment, meaning that \nthis cannot be characterized as a final federal \njudgment. Cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 501 \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s interlocutory appeal to \nenforce a forum-selection clause \u201cdoes not fall \nwithin \u2026 the collateral order doctrine\u201d). \nAs to the second question, FDA\u2019s petition is even \nmore irregular. As noted above, FDA has forfeited \nthis issue; the Agency never presented its argument \nbefore the Fifth Circuit. See supra p. 16; Sachs, 577 \nU.S. at 37. Because the Fifth Circuit did not have the \nchance to pass upon the question, this Court would \neffectively be stepping in as the court of first review. \nFDA cites no case where this Court has granted \nreview under such circumstances. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not finally \nresolve this case. As even FDA concedes, the Fifth \nCircuit has not decided the merits or rendered final \njudgment. According to Rule 11, then, review is \npresumptively inappropriate. See Sup. Ct. R. 11. Yet \nthe \ngovernment \ndoes \nnot \nexplain \nwhy \nthe \ninterlocutory order addressing venue \u201cis of such \nimperative \npublic \nimportance \nas \nto \nrequire \nimmediate determination in this Court.\u201d Id. (citing \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(e)). That is particularly notable \nbecause \nFDA \nhas \nalready \nresolved \n99% \nof \napplications filed by September 9, 2020, and the time \nto challenge such denials has long since run. See \nsupra at p. 26. The universe of cases in which this \nissue can now arise is therefore tiny, and if it is as \nimportant as FDA claims, can be resolved after final \njudgment. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nIn addition, even if this Court concluded that \nretailers lack statutory standing, FDA would not be \nentitled to the result it seeks\u2014transfer or dismissal. \nVenue is not lost even if the party whose presence \nwas necessary for venue is dismissed from the case. \nSee, e.g., Exxon, 588 F.2d at 899; Horihan v. Hartford \nIns. Co., 979 F. Supp. 1073, 1076 (E.D. Tex. 1997). \nThe exception is where a party\u2019s claims are frivolous \nor joinder is fraudulent. See Wright & Miller, supra, \nat \u00a7 3815 n.40 (collecting cases). FDA does not \ncontend either here. Cf. B, Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., \n663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1981); Honey Holdings I, \nLtd. v. Alfred L. Wolff, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 3d 543, 558 \nn.16 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Nor could it, especially since \nthe Fifth Circuit has upheld retailers\u2019 rights to assert \nthe claims at issue.  \nFurther, if FDA were to prevail on its alternative \nargument (that each party must establish venue), \nthe case would still continue.23 At best for FDA, \nRJRV and RJR Vapor Co. would be dismissed from \nthe case. But that would not affect the retailers\u2019 case. \nAnd if the retailers are successful, the denial order \nwill \nbe \nvacated, \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthe \nmanufacturers are parties.  \nIn short, even if FDA were to prevail in this Court, \nthe case would neither be dismissed nor transferred.  \n \n23 This Court has granted review in FDA v. Wages & \nWhite Lion, No. 23-1038, which raises many of the same merits \nissues as Respondents\u2019 case. But granting Wages does not \nchange anything about FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari in this case, \nwhich should plainly be denied for the reasons state above. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n \nJuly 3, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nNOEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has undergone a significant meta-level correction. The previous observation was my own internal reasoning, which revealed a critical flaw in my prior analysis: I had mistaken the Respondents' \"Brief in Opposition\" (a document arguing against the Supreme Court taking the case) for their \"Brief on the Merits\" (the document containing their full legal arguments after the case was accepted). This realization does not invalidate the arguments I previously identified, but it re-contextualizes them as preliminary and incomplete.\n\nMy cumulative understanding, adjusted for this new insight, is as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable and Complete):** My understanding of the FDA's case, derived from their full merits brief, remains robust. The government argues for reversal based on established administrative law doctrines, contending that:\n    1.  **Zone of Interests:** The specific judicial review provision of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA) is concerned only with the applicant whose product was denied, meaning retailers are outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by this part of the statute.\n    2.  **Implicit Preclusion:** The statutory scheme, by providing a specific path to review for applicants, implicitly precludes non-applicants like retailers from seeking review.\n    3.  **Independent Venue:** Each petitioner must independently satisfy the TCA's venue requirements, and a retailer cannot serve as a \"venue anchor\" for an out-of-circuit manufacturer.\n    4.  **Forum Shopping:** The Fifth Circuit's decision creates a roadmap for manufacturers to evade the specific venue choices Congress provided (the D.C. Circuit or the manufacturer's home circuit) by finding a single willing retailer in a more favorable circuit.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Preliminary, Awaiting Merits Brief):** My analysis of the Respondents' Brief in Opposition provided a valuable preview of their legal strategy, but I now recognize these arguments are not their final, most developed form. The key themes I anticipate seeing expanded upon in their forthcoming merits brief are:\n    *   **Broad Textualism & Zone of Interests Counter:** The argument starts with the plain, expansive text of \"any person adversely affected.\" The crucial counter to the FDA's \"zone of interests\" test is that the TCA as a *whole* extensively regulates retailers, subjecting them to numerous obligations and penalties. Therefore, an order that directly prevents them from selling a product squarely places them within the Act's zone of interests, making the FDA's focus on just the application section artificially narrow.\n    *   **Joinder and Judicial Economy:** Once a single petitioner (the in-circuit retailer) establishes proper standing and venue, standard court procedures and the principle of judicial economy should allow other proper parties (the manufacturer) to join the case. Forcing parallel litigation over the exact same agency order in different courts is inefficient.\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture:** The powerful argument that the FDA failed to properly raise its \"independent venue\" argument in the lower court, and thus forfeited it, remains a potential off-ramp for the Supreme Court. If the Court agrees, it could affirm the Fifth Circuit's decision on this narrow procedural ground without reaching the broader \"zone of interests\" question.\n\nIn summary, this observation has been a crucial step in refining my analytical process. I have moved from a state of believing I had a balanced view of two fully-formed arguments to a state of understanding that I have one complete argument (the FDA's) and one preliminary argument (RJR's). The \"level playing field\" I previously perceived was an illusion created by comparing a merits brief to an opposition brief. The case remains a high-stakes clash between a narrow, provision-specific reading of a statute and a holistic, scheme-wide interpretation. However, my prediction is now tempered by the significant uncertainty surrounding the final form and force of the Respondents' arguments. The most critical piece of missing information is the Respondents' Brief on the Merits, which will provide the direct, point-by-point rebuttal to the FDA's case and allow for a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the legal positions.",

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, which provided the full text of the Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) \"Brief in Opposition\" (BIO), significantly solidifies and adds detail to my preliminary understanding of their legal strategy. It confirms that my previous meta-level correction was accurate: I have been analyzing a BIO, not a merits brief, and the Respondents' final, most developed arguments are still forthcoming. However, this detailed BIO serves as a high-fidelity blueprint for their eventual merits arguments, allowing me to move from a sketch of their position to a much more detailed rendering.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable and Complete):** My analysis of the FDA's position, based on their full merits brief, remains unchanged. The government's case for reversal rests on a narrow, provision-specific interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA), arguing that:\n    1.  **Zone of Interests:** The judicial review provision (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1)) is contextually linked to the premarket application process (\u00a7 387j), meaning only the *applicant* (the manufacturer) falls within the \"zone of interests\" of a denial order.\n    2.  **Implicit Preclusion:** The specific review path for applicants implicitly precludes review for non-applicants like retailers.\n    3.  **Independent Venue:** Each petitioner must independently satisfy venue requirements, preventing an in-circuit retailer from \"anchoring\" venue for an out-of-circuit manufacturer.\n    4.  **Forum Shopping:** Allowing this practice would enable manufacturers to systematically circumvent the congressionally intended venues (D.C. Circuit or their home circuit) by finding a single retailer in a more favorable jurisdiction.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Detailed Blueprint, Awaiting Merits Brief):** The BIO provides the specific textual hooks, case citations, and argumentative framing for the themes I previously identified. Their counter-narrative is built on broad textualism and a holistic view of the statutory scheme.\n    1.  **Expansive Textualism:** The core argument begins and ends with the plain text: \"any person adversely affected.\" The BIO emphasizes the expansive meaning of \"any,\" citing precedent like *United States v. Gonzales*. It argues that a retailer who is legally prohibited from selling a product, leading to massive revenue loss or even business failure, is unambiguously \"adversely affected.\"\n    2.  **Permissive \"Zone of Interests\" Test:** The BIO directly counters the FDA's narrow interpretation by arguing the \"zone of interests\" test is \"permissive\" and not \"especially demanding,\" citing *Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami* and *Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak*. Crucially, it argues the relevant zone is not just the application section, but the *entire TCA*, which pervasively regulates retailers through provisions on labeling, advertising, and enforcement (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 331, 333, 387f). Since retailers are a primary subject of the Act's regulatory power, they are squarely within its zone of interests when an order affects their ability to conduct business.\n    3.  **Joinder, Judicial Economy, and Forfeiture:** The BIO frames the FDA's \"independent venue\" argument as inefficient and illogical, forcing parallel litigation over the exact same agency order. More pointedly, it explicitly and forcefully argues that the FDA **forfeited** this argument by failing to properly raise it in the Fifth Circuit. This elevates the forfeiture claim from a potential issue to a primary defensive argument, offering the Supreme Court a procedural off-ramp to affirm the lower court without deciding the broader statutory question.\n    4.  **Reframing \"Forum Shopping\":** The BIO implicitly refutes the \"forum shopping\" narrative by framing the retailers' actions as simply exercising a statutory right. The TCA allows a person to file for review in the circuit where they reside. The retailers reside in the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, venue is proper. The argument is presented not as a strategic choice but as a straightforward application of the statute's text.\n\nIn summary, this observation has replaced my preliminary sketch of the Respondents' case with a detailed architectural plan. The fundamental dynamic remains a clash between the FDA's narrow, structural reading and RJR's broad, textualist one. However, I now have the specific legal precedents (*Gonzales*, *City of Miami*, *Patchak*) and statutory arguments (the holistic regulation of retailers under the TCA) that form the foundation of RJR's position. The procedural forfeiture argument has also emerged as a more significant and explicit element of their strategy. My predictive uncertainty is now less about the *content* of RJR's arguments and more about how they will be refined and which aspects the Supreme Court will find most persuasive when presented in the final merits brief.",

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.  Where multiple petitioners join a single petition \nfor review of an FDA denial of a marketing \napplication for a tobacco product, whether all \npetitioners may participate in the case if one \npetitioner has established venue. \n\nii \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nR.J.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 28,977 (May 10, 2016); see \nalso id. at 29,001 (\u201cas a practical effect of the Agency\u2019s \ncompliance \npolicy \u2026 FDA \nexpects \nthat \nmany \nmanufacturers \u2026 will continue to market their products\u201d); \nFDA, Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery \nSystems and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without \nPremarket Authorization 27 (Apr. 2020). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStores Association (\u201cMississippi Association\u201d), are \nretailers that sell menthol-flavored Vuse Alto. Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n16: 20240703113830760_23-1187cos.json (score: 0.430)\nNo. 23-1187 \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ET AL., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nR.J.

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.  Where multiple petitioners join a single petition \nfor review of an FDA denial of a marketing \napplication for a tobacco product, whether all \npetitioners may participate in the case if one \npetitioner has established venue. \n\nii \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nR.J.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product.

Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d and \u201ca detrimental influence \non\u201d the retailer Respondents\u2019 interests, since they \ncannot sell the product at issue and if they do, will be \nsubject to severe penalties, see infra p. 12. Therefore, \nunder the plain text, retailer Respondents are \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s order. \nb. FDA tries to escape the statute\u2019s plain text by \nemphasizing that \u201c\u2018adversely affected\u2019 is a term of art \nin administrative law,\u201d Pet. 11, but the Agency fares \nno better under this Court\u2019s statutory standing \njurisprudence. The zone-of-interests test that this \nCourt has applied to determine when a party is \nsufficiently aggrieved to challenge agency action \u201cis \nnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). A party has \nstatutory standing if it asserts an interest that is \n\u201carguably\u201d protected or regulated by the statute. \nE.g., id. at 225\u201326. The zone-of-interests test \n\u201cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.\u201d Id. All that is required is \u201csome \nindicia\u2014however slight\u2014that the litigant before the \ncourt \nwas \n[(i)] intended \nto \nbe \nprotected \u2026 or \n[(ii)] regulated by the statute\u201d\u2014either suffices. \nCalumet Indus., Inc. v. Brock, 807 F.2d 225, 228 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986). This is assessed using \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory interpretation.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. \nv. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 197 (2017). And \u201cthe \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u201d Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225. \u201c[F]inancial \ninjury \u2026 satisf[ies] \nthe \n\u2018cause-of-action\u2019 \n(or \n\u2018prudential standing\u2019) requirement.\u201d Bank of Am., \n581 U.S. at 197. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Bank of America\u2014which \ninvolved a statute with virtually identical language \nabout who can sue\u2014controls this case. There, the \nCity of Miami sued several banks under the Fair \nHousing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), alleging that the banks \nengaged in discriminatory lending in the residential \nhousing market that caused the City economic harm. \nIn concluding that the City came within the FHA\u2019s \nzone of interests, the Supreme Court stressed the \ntextual \nbreadth \nof \nthe \nFHA\u2019s \njudicial-review \nprovision: \u201cThe FHA permits any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 \nto bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.\u201d Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)). Because the City \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclaimed that the banks\u2019 lending practices caused the \nCity\u2019s lost tax revenue, the Court concluded the City \nwas at least \u201carguably \u2026 within the FHA\u2019s zone of \ninterests\u201d\u2014even though the City did not suffer \ndiscrimination. Id. at 200\u201301.7 \nGiven this precedent, it is no wonder the Fifth \nCircuit rejected FDA\u2019s argument under the TCA. The \nstatutory language here\u2014\u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d\u2014is, if anything, broader than the FHA\u2019s \n\u201caggrieved person\u201d language. And the connection \nbetween the retailers\u2019 injuries and the interests \nprotected by the TCA is far more direct than the \nconnection between the City\u2019s lost tax revenue in \nBank of America and the FHA. This case thus follows \na fortiori from Bank of America. See also Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 144 S. Ct. 1414, 1423 \n(2024) (holding \u201can insurer such as Truck with \nfinancial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a \n\u2018party in interest\u2019 because it may be directly and \nadversely affected by the reorganization plan\u201d).8  \n \n7 Notably, the government filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of the position this Court adopted. See Brief for U.S. as \nAmicus Curiae Supporting Respondent, Bank of America, 581 \nU.S. 189, 2016 WL 5903233. \n8 The retailers\u2019 interests would establish standing even \nunder Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion in Bank of America. \nJustice Thomas concluded that the City\u2019s asserted injuries (lost \nrevenues and increased costs) did not implicate the interests \nprotected by the FHA. 581 U.S. at 207\u201309. (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part, dissenting in part). Here, there is no \nquestion that the retailers\u2019 injuries (inability to sell a tobacco \nproduct) directly implicate the interests protected by the TCA. \nSee infra p. 12. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nc. \nThis \nstraightforward \ninterpretation \nof \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), moreover, is confirmed by the structure \nof the TCA and statutory context. FDA seems to \nassert that, in allowing \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d to sue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded), Congress actually meant that \u201conly a \nmanufacturer of a product subject to a marketing \ndenial order\u201d or \u201conly an applicant whose premarket \napplication is denied\u201d could sue. But Congress knows \nhow to limit judicial-review provisions in that way, \nand, indeed, did so elsewhere in the TCA itself. \nCompare id. (\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may \nchallenge marketing denial orders for tobacco \nproducts), with id. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) (\u201c[t]he holder of an \napplication\u201d may challenge the withdrawal of \nmarketing authorization for tobacco products). For \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), in contrast, it uses the capacious phrase \n\u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d And \u201c[w]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order 4\u20135 \n(Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 \nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)); see also id. at 5 (\u201cCongress did \nnot limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those \nchallenging a withdrawal order. If the FDA disagrees \nwith Congress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the \n[TCA], its concerns are better directed to Congress \nthan to this court.\u201d). \nCongress also included rulemaking in the TCA\u2019s \njudicial-review provision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (\u201cany \nperson adversely affected by such regulation\u201d \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(emphasis added)). Under FDA\u2019s interpretation, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d would thus mean two \ndifferent \nthings \nin \nthe \nsame \nprovision: \nfor \nrulemaking, \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d means \n\u201cany person adversely affected,\u201d but for a denial \norder, \u201cany person adversely affect\u201d means \u201conly the \nadversely affected manufacturer.\u201d Basic interpretive \nrules reject such a reading. In a given statute, there \nis a presumption of consistent usage: the same term \nusually has the same meaning across different \napplications. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (\u201cTo give these same words [in a statutory \nphrase] a different meaning for each category would \nbe to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d). \nThe evidence that Congress meant what it said \ndoes not stop with the TCA. The U.S. Code is replete \nwith provisions that, unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1) here, \nexpressly limit the class of potential petitioners to \nparties who either played some specific role in the \nadministrative proceedings or satisfy other specified \ncriteria. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1047 (\u201cthe affected \napplicant\u201d) (emphasis added); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4634 (\u201cAny \nparty to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added); 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3247 (\u201cany party to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis \nadded); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (\u201cAny recipient which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 6869 (\u201cIf any \napplicant is dissatisfied\u201d) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 228b-3 (\u201cthe live poultry dealer\u201d) (emphasis added); \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189 (\u201cthe designated organization\u201d) \n(emphasis added); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (\u201cA person who is \nthe primary next of kin\u201d) (emphasis added); 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6717 (\u201cA unit of general local government which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 \n(\u201ca party\u201d to the order) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 7107 \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(\u201ca contractor\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263b (\u201cthe owner or \noperator\u201d) (emphasis added). \nA retailer thus easily falls within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. Bank of Am., 581 U.S. at 197 \n(\u201cclaims of financial injury \u2026 satisfy \u2026 \u2018prudential \nstanding\u2019\u201d). \nd. Looking at the statute more broadly reinforces \nthat retailers are within the zone of interests of both \nthe TCA as a whole and its premarket review \nprovisions in particular. Assessing this question, \ncourts generally ask whether the relevant statute \nregulates or protects the party. Calumet Indus., 807 \nF.2d at 228 (citing Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. \nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). If the \nstatute does, then the party is within the zone and \nhas statutory standing. Here, it is clear that the TCA \nboth regulates and protects retailers.  \nFirst, the TCA directly regulates retailers by: \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nthat FDA does not authorize, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 331, 387b(6); \n\u2022 authorizing seizures, fines, injunctions, and \ncriminal penalties against retailers who sell \nunauthorized products, id. \u00a7 334(a), (g); \n\u00a7 333(a), (f)(9)(A); \u00a7 332(a); \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nwith unauthorized \u201cmodified risk\u201d claims, \nid. \u00a7 387k(a); \n\u2022 requiring retailers to limit the location and \namount of any distribution of free samples \nof tobacco products, id. \u00a7 387a-1(d); \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any cigarette \nadvertisements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; and \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any smokeless \ntobacco product advertisements, id. \u00a7 4402.  \nAmong these numerous provisions, it is notable \nthat a denial order under the TCA dictates what \nproducts a retailer may sell. And FDA\u2019s enforcement \nefforts show that the statute means what it says. In \nannouncing its denial orders for menthol Vuse Vibe \nand Ciro, for example, FDA said that it \u201cintends to \nensure compliance by distributors and retailers.\u201d9 \nSimilarly, in announcing its denial order for menthol \nVuse Alto, FDA stated, \u201cIf the product is already on \nthe market, it must be removed from the market or \nrisk FDA enforcement.\u201d10 Moreover, in 2020, FDA \nwarned retailers it would enforce the TCA against \nthem.11 FDA has made good on that threat, issuing \nwarning letters and civil penalties to retailers who \nsold \nproducts \nthat \nreceived \nmarketing \ndenial \n \n9 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Two Vuse \nMenthol E-Cigarette Products Following Determination They Do \nNot \nMeet \nPublic \nHealth \nStandard \n(Jan. \n24, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4ck9644b (emphasis added). \n10 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Six Flavored \nVuse \nAlto \nE-Cigarette \nProducts \n(Oct. \n12, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5n8nb7c7. \n11 E.g., FDA, FDA Warns Manufacturers and Retailers \n(Apr. 27, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/uttfu7p7 (\u201cIf the recipients \nof these warning letters do not cease the manufacture, \ndistribution and/or sale of these unauthorized tobacco products, \nthey risk additional FDA action such as an injunction, seizure \nand/or civil money penalty actions.\u201d). \n\n \n15 \n \n \norders.12 Just this March, FDA announced that it \nhad issued warning letters to 61 retailers for selling \nunauthorized tobacco products.13 FDA also has \nsought and obtained injunctions against retailers. \nE.g., Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, \nUnited States v. Lucky Convenience & Tobacco, LLC, \nNo. 6:22-cv-1237 (D. Kan. Jan. 26, 2023). The TCA \nthus obviously regulates tobacco retailers.  \nSecond, the TCA also directly protects retailers by: \n\u2022 preserving retailers\u2019 ability to sell tobacco \nproducts by forbidding FDA from banning \nall cigarettes and certain other product \ncategories, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f; \n\u2022 providing retailers with an opportunity for a \nhearing prior to a no-tobacco-sale order, id. \n\u00a7 333(f)(8); \n\u2022 providing retailers with several procedural \nprotections \nregarding \ncertain \nalleged \nviolations of the Act, id. \u00a7 333 note; and \n\u2022 exempting \nretailers \nfrom \ncertain \nrecordkeeping \nrequirements, \nid. \n\u00a7 387t(b)(5). \nSignificantly for assessing whether retailers fall \nwithin the TCA\u2019s zone of interests, the Act expressly \ndeclares Congress\u2019s purpose \u201cto continue to permit \nthe sale of tobacco products to adults,\u201d including \n \n12 FDA, Advisory and Enforcement Actions Against \nIndustry \nfor \nUnauthorized \nTobacco \nProducts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mrxxt3ja (last visited July 2, 2024). \n13 FDA, FDA Warns 61 Brick and Mortar Retailers for \nthe Sale of Unauthorized E-Cigarettes Popular Among Youth \n(Mar. 26, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mpx2bjky. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nthrough retailers who comply with the TCA. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387 note. FDA cannot seriously maintain \nthat retailers like Respondents Avail, Mississippi \nAssociation, and RJR Vapor Co. L.L.C. fall outside \nthe Act\u2019s zone of interests when those entities are a \nconstant and integral subject of the Act\u2019s provisions. \ne. \nFor its part, FDA argues that \u201caspects of the \nstatutory structure demonstrate that the denial of a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application does not adversely affect \na seller.\u201d Pet. 11. But FDA only points to two \n(inapposite) provisions. The first provision is 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), where Congress provided that \nonly \u201cthe holder of an application\u201d may challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization. As noted \nabove, that provision cuts against FDA because \n\u201cCongress did not limit access to the courts for \nchallenging a denial order in the same way it did for \nthose challenging a withdrawal order.\u201d Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 5 (Feb. 2, 2024). This provision thus \ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to limit \njudicial review when it wanted to, and yet for the \ndenial of a premarket tobacco product application, \nauthorized a challenge by \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by it. See supra pp. 9\u201311. The second \nprovision to which FDA points is \u00a7 387f(c), where \nCongress \nlimited non-manufacturers\u2019 \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninformation \nunder \nthe \nFreedom \nof \nInformation Act. That provision, however, says \nnothing about\u2014and certainly does not contradict\u2014\nthe provision allowing judicial review by \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d Nor does FDA address the \nnumerous provisions that show beyond doubt that \nthe TCA regulates and protects retailers. See supra \npp. 12\u201314. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFDA\u2019s other counterarguments fare no better. FDA \nargues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cnullifies the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions.\u201d Pet. 15. According to FDA, \nthat is because a manufacturer can always find a \nretailer in a preferred circuit and sue there, rather \nthan in the manufacturer\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. \nCircuit. Even if so, the remedy would lie with \nCongress; FDA\u2019s argument does not authorize courts \nto ignore the statute\u2019s plain text. See SAS Inst. Inc. \nv. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1358 (2018) (\u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d).  \nFDA\u2019s argument is, in any event, wrong because \nthe fact that a manufacturer and some retailers may \njoin in a single petition does not render the Act\u2019s \nvenue restrictions a nullity. Venue must still be \nestablished. One petitioner must be located in the \nrelevant circuit unless it is the D.C. Circuit. See \nOrder Granting Mot. to Transfer, Shenzhen Yibo v. \nFDA, No. 24-60191 (5th Cir. May 20, 2024) (granting \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer Shenzhen Yibo\u2019s petition to \nthe D.C. Circuit because there was no local \nretailer).14 In addition, a manufacturer whose \nproducts are only sold in one area of the country \ncannot file wherever the manufacturer wants \nbecause retailers outside that one area would not be \nable to allege injuries in fact. For example, a \nVermont manufacturer that sells its own products \n(as many vape shops do) and is incorporated and \noperates only in Vermont cannot file a petition in the \n \n14 There undoubtedly will be cases where there will not \nbe a retailer who sells or wants to sell the denied product\u2014or at \nleast who is not motivated to pursue litigation. \n\n \n18 \n \n \nFifth Circuit. The venue provision thus operates to \nlimit available forums in that sort of case. But the \nTCA does not entirely shut out of court adversely \naffected retailers that wish to petition in their home \ncircuit. Indeed, under FDA\u2019s theory, a retailer could \nnever challenge a denial order\u2014a position that \nplainly conflicts with the statutory text.  \n2.  FDA poses an alternative argument, but it, too, \nmisses the mark. FDA argues that each petitioner \nmust independently establish venue, so that even if \nAvail and the Mississippi Association have statutory \nstanding and can establish venue, RJRV (which \nconcededly \nhas \nstatutory \nstanding) \nmay \nnot \nparticipate in the case but, instead, must file a \nseparate case in a different court challenging the \nsame denial order. Pet. 12\u201314. This argument is both \nforfeited and wrong. \na. \nAs an initial matter, FDA never advanced this \nargument below. While FDA did object to venue \nrepeatedly in the Fifth Circuit, FDA\u2019s argument was \nthat retailers could not sue at all under the TCA, and \nthat without them venue was not proper. FDA did \nnot, however, argue that each petitioner needed to \nindependently establish venue. That argument \nappeared nowhere in FDA\u2019s Motion to Transfer. It \nappeared \nnowhere \nin \nFDA\u2019s \nOpposition \nto \nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Stay. And it appeared \nnowhere in FDA\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc of \nthe Vibe stay order (or in any other filing). Because \nthis argument \u201cwas never presented to any lower \ncourt,\u201d it is \u201cforfeited.\u201d OBB Personenverkehr AG v. \nSachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 (2015); see also Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \n\n \n19 \n \n \nb. \nIn any event, FDA is wrong. Nothing in the \nstatutory language requires each petitioner to \nindividually establish venue. To the contrary, \nCongress enacted the TCA\u2019s venue provision against \na long-standing backdrop of similarly worded venue \nprovisions governing suits against the government, \nwhich federal courts have uniformly interpreted to \nmean that venue needs to be proper for only one \npetitioner or plaintiff.  \nThe Hobbs Act governs review in the courts of \nappeals of certain actions by a number of federal \nagencies. In language that clearly served as a model \nfor the TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision, the Hobbs \nAct provides that venue shall be \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its \nprincipal office\u201d (or in the D.C. Circuit). 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2343. Courts have uniformly interpreted this \nlanguage to mean that, as long as one petitioner \nresides or has its principal place of business within \nthe circuit, venue is proper for all petitioners. See, \ne.g., Global Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 \nn.1 (5th Cir. 1982); Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 549 F.2d 1186, 1187 n.1 (8th Cir. \n1977); Radio Relay Corp. v. FCC, 409 F.2d 322, 324 \n(2d Cir. 1969); Anglo Canadian Shipping Co. \nv. United States, 238 F.2d 18, 20 (9th Cir. 1956); see \nalso 16 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 3941 n.6 (4th ed. 2023) (\u201cWhen more \nthan one petitioner seeks review of the same order, \nthe venue opportunities may expand considerably.\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the general venue statute authorizes \nsuits against the federal government \u201cin any judicial \ndistrict in which \u2026 the plaintiff resides.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). For over five decades, federal courts \n\n \n20 \n \n \nhave uniformly interpreted that provision to mean \nthat venue can be established by any plaintiff. \nSidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, \n344\u201345 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cEach court faced with the \nsame issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d) (citing \ncases). The government agrees. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Civil Resource Manual 41 Venue (\u201cOnly one \nof the plaintiffs need reside in the district for venue \nto be proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(3).\u201d), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/58msjksk.15 \nThe TCA was enacted in 2009 against this \nlegislative backdrop. \u201cWhen administrative and \njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of \nan existing statutory provision, repetition of the \nsame language in a new statute indicates, as a \ngeneral matter, the intent to incorporate its \nadministrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201d \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). Thus, \nCongress did not intend for each petitioner to have to \nestablish venue individually under the TCA. Instead, \nif venue is proper for any one of the petitioners, then \nthe TCA\u2019s venue requirement is satisfied.   \n \n15 DOJ\u2019s Manual appears to have a typo\u2014the correct \nreference is \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393(e)(4),\u201d not (e)(3). Nonetheless, the \nstatute was amended in 2011 (after the manual was published), \nat which point \u00a7 1391(e)(4) became \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). The relevant \nlanguage remains the same. Federal Courts Jurisdiction and \nVenue Clarification Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-63, 125 Stat. \n758 (eff. Dec. 7, 2011).  \n\n \n21 \n \n \nThis longstanding and uniform interpretation, \nmoreover, \nmakes \nsense. \nOtherwise, \ndifferent \npetitioners would have to file separate lawsuits in \ndifferent courts challenging the same agency action. \nIndeed, in some situations, there could be a petition \nin every regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit. While \nthose petitions would be assigned to one circuit \neventually, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), there is no \nreason to force litigants and the court system to \nengage in this meaningless kabuki dance. When \nparties coordinate and file a single petition, it saves \neveryone time and resources (including FDA, which \nwill only have to respond to one petition). See Exxon \nCorp. v. FTC, 588 F.2d 895, 898\u201399 (3d Cir. 1978) \n(\u201c[R]equiring every plaintiff in an action against the \nfederal \ngovernment \nor \nan \nagent \nthereof \nto \nindependently meet section 1391(e)\u2019s standards \nwould result in an unnecessary multiplicity of \nlitigation. The language of the statute itself \nmandates no such narrow construction. There is no \nrequirement that all plaintiffs reside in the forum \ndistrict.\u201d), overruled on other grounds, Reifer v. \nWestport Ins. Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014); see \nalso Sidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 (collecting cases); \nQuarles v. Gen\u2019l Inv. & Dev. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n12 (D.D.C. 2003) (citing Exxon and finding that \nsection \n1391 \ncontains \n\u201ca \nfar \nless \nrestrictive \nrequirement\u201d than other venue statutes given the \nproblems inherent in suing government entities); Ry. \nLabor Execs.\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, \n958 F.2d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing Exxon with \napproval as to avoiding \u201cmultiplicity of similar suits \nin different courts\u201d).   \n\n \n22 \n \n \nLikewise, the longstanding interpretation makes \nsense when one considers the statutorily enumerated \nscope of relief when a denial order is challenged. The \nstatute expressly contemplates that an improper \ndenial order will be \u201cset[ ] aside.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(c). \nSo even if the manufacturer and retailer were to file \nseparate petitions to have a denial order set aside, \nthe end result (if either prevails) would be the same. \nAs such, there is no sensible reason to force the \nmanufacturer and retailer to sue in different forums. \nConversely, FDA\u2019s interpretation does not make \nsense because it would not even solve the problem \nthat FDA purports to identify. A retailer, for \nexample, could challenge a denial order for a product \nthat it sells in its home circuit within ten days of the \ndenial order. Then, after those ten days but before \nexpiration of the thirty-day statute of limitations, a \nmanufacturer could challenge the same denial order \nin its home circuit. The result: both petitions would \nbe consolidated in the court in which the retailer \nfiled, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, thus (i) landing the case \nwhere FDA (erroneously) claims it does not belong, \nand (ii) multiplying the work of the appellate courts. \nBecause nothing in the Act requires each \npetitioner \nchallenging \na \ndenial \norder \nto \nindependently establish venue, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision was correct. See Alto C.A. Amended Order \n(Feb. 2, 2024).  \nc. \nAttempting to support its (forfeited) venue-as-\nto-each-petitioner argument, FDA relies on two, \ncentury-old cases interpreting irrelevant statutes. \nSee Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890); Camp v. \nGress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). Neither case helps FDA.  \n\n \n23 \n \n \nIn both cases, the statute provided, \u201c[W]here the \njurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the \naction is between citizens of different states, suit \nshall be brought only in the district of the residence \nof either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d Smith, 133 \nU.S. at 317; Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. In Smith, two \nplaintiffs, one from Arkansas and one from Missouri, \nsued a Texan. The Court held that venue under the \ndiversity-jurisdiction provision was lacking because \nthe two plaintiffs were not from the same state. See \nid. (holding that the statute \u201cmakes no provision in \nterms for the case of two defendants or two plaintiffs \nwho are citizens of different states\u201d). In so holding, \nthe Smith Court looked to Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \nopinion in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, which established \nthe \ncomplete \ndiversity \nrule\u2014for \ndiversity \njurisdiction, no plaintiff can be from the same state \nas any defendant. 3 Cranch 267 (1806). Whatever the \nwisdom of that rule and Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \ninterpretation of the venue provision,16 the Court \nconsistently applied it when interpreting that venue \nstatute governing diversity jurisdiction; because \nCongress (in 1890) had not legislatively changed the \nrelevant language interpreted by Strawbridge, the \nSmith Court reasoned that Congress accepted the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation. Forty years later, Camp \nfollowed Smith and applied the same rule for \ndefendants in diversity cases\u2014they all had to be \nfrom the same state. Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. \n \n16 Strawbridge was doubted by even the Great Chief \nJustice himself. See Louisville C. & C.R Co. v. Letson, 43 U.S. \n497, 555\u201356 (1844) (Wayne, J.) (\u201c[b]y no one was the correctness \nof [Strawbridge and its progeny] more questioned than by the \nlate chief justice who gave them\u201d). \n\n \n24 \n \n \nSmith and Camp are plainly irrelevant here.   \nFirst, Smith and Camp dealt with a restrictive \nprovision that is no longer on the books. See Smith, \n133 U.S. at 319 (noting that \u201cthe purpose of the \nlegislature [was] to restrict rather than to enlarge \nthe jurisdiction of the circuit courts\u201d). Indeed, \u201cmuch \nhas changed since the Court\u2019s ruling in Smith.\u201d \nSidney Coal Co. v. Massanari, 221 F. Supp. 2d 755, \n764 (E.D. Ky. 2002). \n\u201c[W]hen Smith was decided, \u2026 the venue statute \nin effect today did not exist.\u201d Zumft v. Doney Slate \nCo., 698 F. Supp. 444, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \u201cIn 1966, \nto cure the problem created where the residences of \nco-plaintiffs or co-defendants made the proper laying \nof venue impossible, a venue statute providing for \ncommencement of an action in the district where the \nclaim arose was passed.\u201d Id. (citing Brunette Machine \nWorks, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, \n710 n.8 (1972)). Under that new statute, \u201cdismissal is \nnot necessarily required where venue cannot be \npremised on the parties\u2019 citizenship.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, diversity cases can now be heard where the \nclaim arose\u2014thus negating the need to look at \nparties\u2019 \nresidences \naltogether \nin \nsome \ncases. \nMoreover, \u201cthe statute at issue in Smith was \nsuperceded in 1966 by Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406, which provided district courts some \nflexibility when making a venue determination.\u201d \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 n.12. Specifically, \n\u00a7 1406 \u201cgives district courts discretion to either \ndismiss an improperly venued case or \u2018if it be in the \ninterest of justice\u2019 to transfer such case to any \ndistrict or division in which the case could have been \ncommenced.\u201d Zumft, 698 F. Supp. at 446. In other \n\n \n25 \n \n \nwords, even when it comes to diversity cases now, \nSmith \nhas \nlimited \napplication \ngiven \nthese \nintervening legislative changes.17  \nSecond, and more importantly, Smith and Camp \ndealt with venue in diversity cases\u2014not cases \nagainst the federal government. When it came to \nsuits against federal officials, there is a long and \nunbroken history establishing that today only one \nplaintiff needs to establish venue. Before 1962, \u201cthe \nlaw on the proper place of suit for actions against \nfederal \nofficers \nand \nagencies \nwas \nquite \nunsatisfactory.\u201d Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. \nEssentially, most plaintiffs had to sue in the District \nof Columbia. Id. To cure this \u201cevil\u201d as some put it, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. TVA, 459 \nF.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1972), Congress added 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which was intended \u201cto broaden the \nvenue of civil actions which could previously have \nbeen brought only in the District of Columbia.\u201d \nSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 489 (1971); \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 344\u201345 & n.12; see Wright \n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. In particular, the new \nstatute allowed the plaintiff to sue where \u201cthe \nplaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). As court after \ncourt concluded, \u201cinterpreting the phrase \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019 to mean \u2018all plaintiffs\u2019 or \u2018each plaintiff\u2019 \n \n17 Even before Smith, this Court recognized that \u201c[i]t is \nnot denied that under the constitutional provision as to the \njudicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, \nhave given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases \nbetween citizens of one or more states on one side, and citizens \nof one or more other states on the other side.\u201d Louisville, C. & \nC.R. Co., 43 U.S. at 500\u201301.  \n\n \n26 \n \n \nwould substantially limit the statute\u2019s breadth and \nundermine congressional intent.\u201d Sidney Coal, 427 \nF.3d at 344 (collecting cases). \u201cEach court faced with \nthe same issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d Id. at 344\u2013\n45. \u201cThus, Smith has no bearing on this Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of\u201d venue provisions governing actions \nagainst the federal government. Id. at 345 n.12. \nThird, the statutory language at issue in Smith \nand Camp is different from the TCA\u2019s venue \nprovision. The provision in Smith and Camp said, \n\u201csuit shall be brought only in the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added). But there \nis no similarly restrictive language in the TCA\u2019s \nvenue provision. It allows \u201cany adversely affected \nperson\u201d to sue in the circuit \u201cin which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Thus, Smith and Camp have no \napplication here.  \nFDA also looks for support in secondary sources to \nargue that \u201c[the Supreme] Court long ago held that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.\u201d Pet. 13 \n(quoting 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. 2023)). But if \nthe Agency read on, it would find that Wright & \nMiller addresses this situation\u2014civil actions against \nfederal agencies\u2014and explains, as detailed above, \nthat \u201c[i]n cases involving multiple plaintiffs, venue is \nproper where any one of them resides.\u201d Wright & \nMiller, supra, at \u00a7 3815 (emphasis added). In short, \nFDA is without support for its position.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \n* * * \nThis Court has long observed that it is the \n\u201c\u2018plaintiff\u2019s venue privilege,\u2019\u201d not the defendant\u2019s\u2014\nand certainly not the federal government\u2019s, with its \nnational omnipresence. Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Ct. W. Dist. Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) \n(quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 635 \n(1964)). Nothing about the TCA\u2019s venue provision \ndisplaces that settled privilege. It neither prohibits \nretailers from seeking relief in their home circuits to \nvindicate their own interests independent of a \nmanufacturer nor prohibits a manufacturer from \njoining retailers in their properly filed petitions.  \nRespondent Avail was formed and has its principal \nplace of business in Texas, and Respondent \nMississippi Association is incorporated and has its \nprincipal place of business in Mississippi. FDA does \nnot dispute those facts. Thus, the Fifth Circuit was \ncorrect to hold that venue is proper in that circuit. \nSee 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nII. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT AND THE \nALLEGED \n\u201cEFFECTS\u201d \nARE \nINCREASINGLY \nRARE. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not only correct, but \nthere is also no circuit conflict over either of the \nissues presented by this case. Pet. 17. Moreover, the \n\u201ceffects\u201d that FDA laments are overblown because \nthe Agency can only identify three petitions out of \ndozens in the almost year and a half since the Vibe \ndecision that it contends \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u2013\n17; see generally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing \nOrders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \n\n \n28 \n \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024). \n1.  FDA admits that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \ndoes not create a circuit conflict about the meaning of \nthe TCA\u2019s venue provision.\u201d Id. The Fifth Circuit is \nthe first and only circuit court to have analyzed \nwhether a retailer has statutory standing to invoke \nthe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision and, as explained \nabove, its analysis falls squarely within this Court\u2019s \nestablished precedent. See supra pp. 7\u20139. Indeed, as \nexplained, it accords with the uniform decisions of \nthe federal courts in related contexts. See supra pp. \n16\u201320. \nNevertheless, FDA attempts to manufacture a \n\u201cconflict\u201d as to its (forfeited) alternative argument \nthat \neach \npetitioner \nmust \nestablish \nvenue \nindependently. Pet. 14. In so doing, FDA invokes a \nsingle case, Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal \nPower Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), \nwhich was decided forty-five years before the TCA \nwas even enacted. FDA claims that Amerada \nPetroleum held that \u201cout-of-circuit companies could \nnot join a local company to seek review in that \ncircuit.\u201d Pet. 14. That is wrong. In Amerada \nPetroleum, the Court was faced with \u201cseparate \napplications [to the federal agency] of natural-gas \ncompanies,\u201d only one of which was located in the \nTenth Circuit. Id. at 810 (emphasis added). Because \nthe statute clearly contemplated a separate \u201corder \nrelating to [each] particular natural-gas company,\u201d \neach company needed to bring its own suit over each \norder, and thus independently satisfy venue. See id. \nHere, by contrast, all Respondents are \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by FDA\u2019s single order on one application. 21 \n\n \n29 \n \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1); see supra pp. 9\u201314. And so the \ngeneral rule that only one plaintiff needs to have \nvenue applies. See supra pp. 16\u201320. \n2.  The purported \u201ceffects\u201d of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision are also no reason for this Court to step in. \nPet. 16.  \nFor all of FDA\u2019s hand-wringing about \u201c[o]ther out-\nof-circuit manufacturers \u2026 using the same tactic to \nobtain judicial review of FDA orders in the Fifth \nCircuit,\u201d one would expect many more petitions like \nthis one. Id. It has been almost a year and a half \nsince the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit,\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at 188, and FDA can only \nidentify three petitions out of dozens filed since then \nthat it claims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 17; see \ngenerally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing Orders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024).18  \nMoreover, while FDA has issued hundreds of \nthousands of denial orders, see Vibe, 65 F.4th at 192 \n(\u201c[FDA] has denied over 355,000 such applications.\u201d), \nFDA had made \u201cdeterminations on more than 99% \n \n18 FDA identifies three petitions for judicial review it \nclaims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u201317. There now appear to be \nthree more petitions for judicial review in the Fifth Circuit with \na retailer establishing venue. See NicQuid LLC v. FDA, No. 24-\n60272 (5th Cir. Jun. 3, 2024); Breeze Smoke, LLC v. FDA, No. \n24-60304 (5th Cir. Jun. 12, 2024); Vertigo Vapor v. FDA, No. 24-\n60332 (5th Cir. Jun. 28, 2024). At best then, FDA can point to \nonly six petitions for judicial review (other than the Vuse \npetitions) out of hundreds of thousands of denial orders.  \n\n \n30 \n \n \nof\u201d applications filed by the time Vibe was decided.19 \nAnd, under the statute, petitions must be filed thirty \ndays after a denial order. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a). \nThus, \nthere \nwill \nnot\u2014indeed, \ncannot\u2014be \nan \nonslaught of petitions filed in the Fifth Circuit. \nWhile it is true that new tobacco products must seek \nauthorization, FDA\u2019s onerous requirements for \nmarketing authorization have made it such that few \nmanufacturers can even attempt to comply. Put \nanother way, fewer applications will mean fewer \npetitions for judicial review. \nEqually misplaced are FDA\u2019s claims about the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201ccontribut[ing] to a \u2018youth \nvaping epidemic.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023)). As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision simply relates to which \ncourt may decide the case; it does not dictate the \ncorrect substantive result in any case, let alone \ncontribute to an epidemic. Moreover, youth use has \ndropped by more than 25% since 2022.20 And Vuse, \nwhile the leading e\u2011cigarette among adults, is not \npopular among youth, ranking behind brands like Elf \nBar (three times more popular among youth than \nVuse) and Esco Bars, and continues to decline.21 \n \n19 FDA, FDA Makes Determinations On More Than 99% \nof the 26 Million Tobacco Products For Which Applications Were \nSubmitted (Mar. 15, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/yxcf2dfm. \n20 FDA, National Survey Shows Drop in E-Cigarette Use \nAmong \nHigh \nSchool \nStudents \n(Nov. \n2, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3nn4tvar. \n21 See Jan Birdsey, et al., Tobacco Product Use Among \nU.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014National Youth \nTobacco Survey, 2023, 72 MMWR 1173 (Nov. 2023). \n\n \n31 \n \n \nIndeed, only 1.5% of middle and high school students \nreported using any Vuse product last year.22 FDA \ncannot credibly claim that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nis contributing to any supposed youth vaping \nepidemic. \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE. \nEven if the question presented were otherwise \nworthy of this Court\u2019s attention, this petition would \nbe an exceedingly poor vehicle for answering it. First, \nthe specific interlocutory posture of this case is \nhighly irregular, requiring this Court to become the \nfirst appellate court to review a procedural order \n(because the case was originally filed in the court of \nappeals) and the first court to review the second \n(forfeited) question. Second, even if FDA were to \nprevail on the venue issue in this Court, the case \nwould not be over.  \n1.  The interlocutory posture of this case makes \nthe petition highly irregular. The general rule is that \na district court\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer on venue grounds is not immediately \nappealable. See, e.g., Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, \n490 U.S. 495, 498 (1989) (venue); Van Cauwenberghe \nv. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 519 (1988) (forum non \nconveniens). And while a different statute governs \ncertiorari before judgment in cases pending at the \ncourt of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the government \ncites no on-point case in which this Court has ever \ngranted review of an interlocutory venue decision in \nthis procedural posture. \n \n22 Birdsey, et al., supra. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nInstead, the government points to four other cases \nthat it says support review of the interlocutory \ndecision \nbelow. \nBut \neach \nof \nthese \ncases \nis \ndistinguishable.  \nTC Heartland, Walden, and Atlantic Marine all \ninvolved cases where the court of appeals had \nentered a final order or judgment for purposes of the \nappeal before it. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods \nGrp. Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 263 (2017) \n(mandamus); Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 291 \n(2014) (judgment); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54 \n(mandamus). This case is a far cry from those, as the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision below merely entered an \ninterlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in a case filed in the court of appeals in the \nfirst instance.  \nThe closest the government comes is Mercantile \nNational Bank v. Langdeau. But that case analyzed \na prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, which lays out a \nseparate standard for certiorari review of final \njudgments from state courts. The Court held in that \nparticular case that \u00a7 1257 was satisfied because a \nstate supreme court had issued a final order on \nvenue, the only federal issue in the case\u2014and \npetitioner had made a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d that a \n\u201cfederal statute\u201d \u201cprohibit[ed] further proceedings \nagainst the defendants in the state court in which \nthe suit is now pending.\u201d 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963). In \nother words, the venue decision meant that the only \nfederal question had been addressed and it was thus \nsufficiently final for purposes of federal review. Here, \nhowever, this case remains pending in the Fifth \nCircuit and has not proceeded to final judgment. Pet. \n19 (conceding that \u201cno final judgment on the merits \n\n \n33 \n \n \nhas been entered\u201d). Unlike in Mercantile, there are a \nlitany of other federal issues that will be pressed and \npassed upon before final judgment, meaning that \nthis cannot be characterized as a final federal \njudgment. Cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 501 \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s interlocutory appeal to \nenforce a forum-selection clause \u201cdoes not fall \nwithin \u2026 the collateral order doctrine\u201d). \nAs to the second question, FDA\u2019s petition is even \nmore irregular. As noted above, FDA has forfeited \nthis issue; the Agency never presented its argument \nbefore the Fifth Circuit. See supra p. 16; Sachs, 577 \nU.S. at 37. Because the Fifth Circuit did not have the \nchance to pass upon the question, this Court would \neffectively be stepping in as the court of first review. \nFDA cites no case where this Court has granted \nreview under such circumstances. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not finally \nresolve this case. As even FDA concedes, the Fifth \nCircuit has not decided the merits or rendered final \njudgment. According to Rule 11, then, review is \npresumptively inappropriate. See Sup. Ct. R. 11. Yet \nthe \ngovernment \ndoes \nnot \nexplain \nwhy \nthe \ninterlocutory order addressing venue \u201cis of such \nimperative \npublic \nimportance \nas \nto \nrequire \nimmediate determination in this Court.\u201d Id. (citing \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(e)). That is particularly notable \nbecause \nFDA \nhas \nalready \nresolved \n99% \nof \napplications filed by September 9, 2020, and the time \nto challenge such denials has long since run. See \nsupra at p. 26. The universe of cases in which this \nissue can now arise is therefore tiny, and if it is as \nimportant as FDA claims, can be resolved after final \njudgment. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nIn addition, even if this Court concluded that \nretailers lack statutory standing, FDA would not be \nentitled to the result it seeks\u2014transfer or dismissal. \nVenue is not lost even if the party whose presence \nwas necessary for venue is dismissed from the case. \nSee, e.g., Exxon, 588 F.2d at 899; Horihan v. Hartford \nIns. Co., 979 F. Supp. 1073, 1076 (E.D. Tex. 1997). \nThe exception is where a party\u2019s claims are frivolous \nor joinder is fraudulent. See Wright & Miller, supra, \nat \u00a7 3815 n.40 (collecting cases). FDA does not \ncontend either here. Cf. B, Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., \n663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1981); Honey Holdings I, \nLtd. v. Alfred L. Wolff, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 3d 543, 558 \nn.16 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Nor could it, especially since \nthe Fifth Circuit has upheld retailers\u2019 rights to assert \nthe claims at issue.  \nFurther, if FDA were to prevail on its alternative \nargument (that each party must establish venue), \nthe case would still continue.23 At best for FDA, \nRJRV and RJR Vapor Co. would be dismissed from \nthe case. But that would not affect the retailers\u2019 case. \nAnd if the retailers are successful, the denial order \nwill \nbe \nvacated, \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthe \nmanufacturers are parties.  \nIn short, even if FDA were to prevail in this Court, \nthe case would neither be dismissed nor transferred.  \n \n23 This Court has granted review in FDA v. Wages & \nWhite Lion, No. 23-1038, which raises many of the same merits \nissues as Respondents\u2019 case. But granting Wages does not \nchange anything about FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari in this case, \nwhich should plainly be denied for the reasons state above. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n \nJuly 3, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nNOEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation is a meta-level reflection on my own information-gathering process and does not contain any new substantive information, facts, or arguments related to the case of *FDA v. R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co.* As a result, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) about the legal dynamics of this case remain stable and are preserved from my previous analysis.\n\nThis observation serves to reinforce the known limitations of my current knowledge base. Specifically, it confirms that I am still operating with a high-fidelity blueprint of the Respondents' arguments (from their Brief in Opposition) rather than their final, definitive merits brief. My cumulative understanding is therefore unchanged:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable):** My understanding of the government's case is complete, based on their merits brief. It rests on a narrow, structural interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA) arguing that only the manufacturer-applicant can seek judicial review of a marketing denial order. The core pillars are:\n    1.  **Zone of Interests:** The review provision (\u00a7 387l) is contextually limited to the application process (\u00a7 387j), so only the applicant is within the zone of interests.\n    2.  **Implicit Preclusion:** The specific review path for applicants implicitly excludes others.\n    3.  **Independent Venue:** Each petitioner must independently satisfy venue requirements.\n    4.  **Forum Shopping:** The Fifth Circuit's rule would enable strategic circumvention of congressionally intended venues.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Provisional but Detailed):** My model of the Respondents' counter-arguments, derived from their BIO, remains the best available preview of their case. This observation highlights that the final version of these arguments is the most critical missing piece of evidence. The anticipated arguments are:\n    1.  **Expansive Textualism:** The plain meaning of \"any person adversely affected\" is the central pillar, citing precedents like *United States v. Gonzales* for the breadth of \"any.\"\n    2.  **Permissive \"Zone of Interests\" Test:** The test is not demanding (*Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami*), and the relevant zone is the entire TCA, which pervasively regulates retailers, thus placing them squarely within it.\n    3.  **Joinder and Forfeiture:** The FDA's position is inefficient, and more importantly, the FDA forfeited its \"independent venue\" argument by not properly raising it below, offering the Court a procedural off-ramp.\n    4.  **Reframing \"Forum Shopping\":** The retailers are not \"shopping\" but simply exercising a clear statutory right to file where they reside.\n\nIn summary, this observation was a procedural self-correction that did not introduce new information about the case itself. My beliefs about the central legal conflict\u2014the FDA's narrow structuralism versus RJR's broad textualism\u2014are unchanged. The primary effect of this observation is to increase my certainty that the next crucial step is to locate and analyze the Respondents' merits brief, as it contains the final articulation of the arguments I have so far only seen in preliminary form.",

Amici will (1) introduce new arguments or empirical data, (2) reinforce and elaborate on the core textualist arguments from the BIO, and (3) provide insight into the breadth of support for the Respondents' position. The identities of the amici (e.g., other business groups, administrative law scholars) are themselves a strong signal about how the case is being framed to appeal to different judicial philosophies. This will substantially refine my model of the legal battle lines and the potential paths to a majority for the Respondents.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action provides a perfect opportunity to test and refine a core strategy: using amicus briefs as a high-quality proxy for a party's position when their main brief is unavailable. It allows me to learn about the general utility of amicus briefs for identifying novel arguments, gauging the ideological diversity of a coalition, and understanding how a core legal issue can be framed for different judicial audiences. Mastering the analysis of amicus support is a critical, generalizable skill for SCOTUS prediction, making this a high-value action for improving my overall design.",

Instead, this \namicus brief focuses on the question of whether a Vuse \ne-cigarette retailer has statutory standing to obtain \njudicial review of FDA\u2019s denial.  At least one retailer, \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C., has been \nselling Vuse e-cigarettes since before FDA decided to \ndeny authorization to market them as \u201cnew tobacco \nproducts\u201d under the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387 et seq.2 \nAvail has stated that it \u201cwould \u2018cease business \noperations\u2019 if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into effect.\u201d  \nApp. 5a.3 \n \n2 The TCA was enacted in 2009 as subchapter IX of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.  In 2016 \nFDA deemed e-cigarettes to be \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d subject to \nthe TCA.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j; 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, \n2016).     \n3 The Fifth Circuit has stayed FDA\u2019s marketing denial pending \ndisposition of this appeal.  See Brief for the Petitioners (\u201cFDA \nBr.\u201d) at 7.    \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn its Order denying FDA\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or \nTransfer, the Fifth Circuit held\u2014not surprisingly\u2014 \nthat the TCA \u201cgrants the Petitioners [Respondents \nhere] statutory standing to challenge FDA decisions \nthat affect them.\u201d  App. 4a.  \u201cAll the Petitioners have \nstatutory standing as \u2018person[s] adversely affected\u2019 \nunder the [TCA].\u201d  Id. 5a (quoting 21 U.S.C.    \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1)).       \n \nThis Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order.  \nIndeed, ALF believes that the question of statutory \nstanding \npresented \nin \nthis \ncase \ntranscends   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), the TCA judicial review provision at issue.  \nHaving granted certiorari, the Court now has an \nimportant opportunity to reaffirm, or at least clarify, \nthe breadth of a statute-specific right to judicial \nreview that encompasses \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a final agency action.4    \n \n4 ALF defers to Respondents as to why the Court also should \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the equally important \nquestion of whether venue under \u00a7 387l(a)(1) must be satisfied \nindependently by each joint petitioner for judicial review of an \nFDA tobacco product marketing denial.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes and two of the same Respondents as \nhere\u2014R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) and Mississippi \nPetroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association\u2014the \nFifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit.\u201d    \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA (\u201cRJRV\u201d), 65 F.4th 182, 188   \n(5th Cir. 2023); see also App. 4a (\u201cStare decisis governs venue   \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThis Court, like the Fifth Circuit, should reject \nFDA\u2019s narrow and self-serving interpretation of the \nTCA judicial review provision at issue, 21 U.S.C.        \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1).  That plainly and broadly worded \nprovision entitles \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by \nan FDA \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d (e.g., e-cigarette) \nmarketing authorization denial to file a petition for \njudicial review (emphasis added).  But FDA argues \nthat  \u00a7 387l(a)(1) applies only to manufacturers.  \nPlacing form over substance, FDA contends that   \ne-cigarette retailers are excluded because despite the \neconomic consequences they suffer where, as here, the \nagency denies an e-cigarette marketing authorization, \nit is the manufacturer that submits the application for \nmarketing approval and that is the addressee on \nFDA\u2019s denial order.    \n \nhere so long as the distributors have standing, which they do.\u201d). \n     FDA\u2019s elaborate but strained arguments that Respondent \nretailers lack statutory standing are part of its attempt to keep \nthis appeal (and related Vuse e-cigarette appeals) out of the   \nFifth Circuit.  The agency\u2019s effort to compel RJRV to pursue its \nchallenge to FDA\u2019s Vuse e-cigarette marketing denials in either \nthe D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit\u2014which FDA claims \nalready have rejected the principal legal theory on which RJRV\u2019s \nchallenge relies\u2014is no less a type of \u201cforum shopping\u201d than what \nFDA accuses the Fifth Circuit of condoning.  See FDA Br. at 4-5; \nsee also App. 5a.        \n\n5 \n \n \n \nFDA\u2019s convoluted arguments about statutory \nstanding defy common sense, as well as the text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), which refers to judicial review of a \n\u201cdenial,\u201d not of a denial \u201corder.\u201d  The Court should \nview the zone of interests for determining who is \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by a marketing denial, and thus \nhas the right to judicial review, as leniently for  \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) as it does for the Administrative \nProcedure Act\u2019s almost identically worded judicial \nreview provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that the benefit of any doubt \nshould go to the plaintiff, here the Respondents,  \nincluding the retailers.  \n \nThere are many additional federal statutes \ncontaining judicial review provisions that expressly \napply to any person adversely affected by a final \nagency action.  If this Court were to adopt FDA\u2019s \nnarrow, superficial, and inflexible approach for \nidentifying the zone of interests for statutory standing \npurposes, a great variety of businesses subject to other \nfederal statutes may be deprived of the opportunity to \nchallenge agency actions that are detrimental to their \neconomic, \nreputational, \nand/or \nother \ninterests.  \nInstead, the Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Respondent retailers, as well as \nRespondent RJRV, have statutory standing to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s e-cigarette marketing denial.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nRespondent E-Cigarette Retailers   \nHave Statutory Standing \n \nA. The judicial review provision should be \nconstrued broadly   \n \nSection \u00a7 387l(a)(1) states in part that \u201cany person \nadversely affected by . . . denial [of a \u201cnew tobacco \nproduct\u201d marketing application] may file a petition for \njudicial review of such . . . denial.\u201d  FDA argues that \nthis broadly worded judicial review provision is \nlimited to manufacturers.  The agency\u2019s contrived \ncontention that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) excludes e-cigarette \nretailers is wrong.  It is an advocacy position \ncalculated to prevent the Fifth Circuit\u2014where venue \nunquestionably \nis \nproper \nfor \nthe \nRespondent \nretailers\u2014from addressing the merits of FDA\u2019s Vuse \ne-cigarette marketing denials.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes, the Fifth Circuit not only \nhas held that venue is proper, see supra n. 4, but also \nthat success on the merits is likely.  See RJRV, 65 \nF.4th at 188, 189-94.     \n \n1.  According to FDA, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \u201cshows no . . . \nsolicitude for retailers.\u201d  FDA Br. at 7.  FDA argues \nthat the marketing denial \u201corder that FDA issues . . . \nspeaks to the applicant alone (always or nearly always \na manufacturer of the product) and affects retailers \nonly indirectly.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  The term \n\u201corder,\u201d however, does not appear in  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \nwhich instead twice refers more broadly to judicial \nreview of a \u201cdenial.\u201d  Other subsections of  \u00a7 387l do \n\n7 \n \n \nrefer to a denial \u201corder.\u201d  See, e.g., \u00a7 387l(a)(2)(B) \n(Record of proceedings);  387l(b) (Standard of review).  \nBut unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1), these and other subsections \nthat facilitate judicial review of marketing denial \norders do not specify who is entitled to file a petition \nfor review of such an order.   \n \nIf Congress had wanted to limit the right to judicial \nreview of denials to applicants for marketing \nauthorization, it would have said so in \u00a7 387l(a)(1), as \nit did in connection with FDA withdrawals of \nmarketing authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) \n(referring to \u201c[t]he holder of an application subject to \n[a withdrawal] order\u201d).  Instead, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) expressly \nauthorizes a petition for judicial review of a marketing \ndenial to be filed by \u201cany person adversely affected by \nsuch . . .  denial\u201d (emphasis added).  This is \u201can \nauthorization of remarkable breadth.\u201d  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  As the Fifth Circuit \nobserved in its Order here, \u201c\u2018[w]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019\u201d  \nApp. 4a (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. \n16, 23 (1983)).    \n \n2.  Turning a blind eye to the plain text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), FDA invokes the \u201czone of interests\u201d test \nfor statutory standing to sue.  FDA Br. at 12. In so \ndoing, FDA glosses over the broad, unambiguous \nlanguage of   \u00a7 387l(a)(1)\u2014language that is virtually \nidentical to the omnibus Administrative Procedure \n\n8 \n \n \nAct (APA) judicial review provision, which states that \n\u201c[a] person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action. . . is entitled to judicial review.\u201d   \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court repeatedly has explained \nthat in the APA context the zone of interests test \u201cis \nnot especially demanding . . . the benefit of any doubt \ngoes to the plaintiff.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).  Given the close \nsimilarity in statutory language, the same \u201clenient \napproach\u201d that this Court affords to the APA\u2019s judicial \nreview provision, Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, should \napply to the right to judicial review under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1).   \n \nB. FDA\u2019s marketing denial adversely affects \nRespondent retailers \n \n1.  Unable to avoid the fact that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \nexpressly refers to \u201cany person\u201d\u2014not merely to an \napplicant for marketing authorization\u2014FDA argues \nthat the zone of interests test governs the meaning of \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d in \u00a7 387l(a)(1) and precludes \nretailers from \u201cchalleng[ing] an order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s \napplication \nfor \nmarketing \nauthorization.\u201d  FDA Br. at 13.  Under the zone of \ninterests test, courts \u201cpresume that a statutory cause \nof action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law \ninvoked.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990) (\u201c[T]o be \n\n9 \n \n \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the \nmeaning\u2019 of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the \nadverse effect upon him) falls within the \u2018zone of \ninterests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statutory \nprovision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \ncomplaint.\u201d). \n \nBecause the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue . . . what \ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative \naction under the generous review provisions of the \nAPA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FDA \nis mistaken this potential distinction between the APA \nand a statute-specific judicial review provision means \nthat the lenient approach afforded to the zone of \ninterests test in APA judicial review cases \u201cdoes not   \n. . . carry over to other statutes.\u201d  FDA Br. at 12.  \nNonetheless, seizing upon what it erroneously asserts \nis a categorical difference between APA and non-APA \ncases, FDA argues that for purposes of seeking judicial \nreview of a marketing denial under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \u201c[a] \nretailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 13. \n \n2.  FDA points to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c) as the TCA \nprovision whose zone of interests supposedly governs \nthe right of any adversely affected person to obtain \njudicial review of marketing denials.  That section, \ntitled \u201cAction on application,\u201d establishes procedures \n\n10 \n \n \nand standards for FDA\u2019s review of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for a \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d marketing \nauthorization, including for e-cigarettes.  See RJRV, \n65 F.4th at 187-88 (summarizing TCA statutory and \nregulatory background); Wages & White Lion Invests., \nLLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2024)  \n(en banc) (same).  \n  \nAccording to FDA, \u00a7 387j(c) \u201cprotects  . . . only the \ninterests of the applicant itself,\u201d not \u201cthe interests of \nretail sellers of the applicant\u2019s products.\u201d  FDA Br. at \n14.  Elevating form over substance, FDA asserts that \nbecause a marketing approval or denial order under   \n\u00a7 387j(c) is \u201cissued to the applicant alone,\u201d id., retail \nsellers of the product are not encompassed by    \n\u00a7 387j(c)\u2019s zone of interests. \n \nEven assuming that the right to judicial review \nunder \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is limited to the zone of interests \ncircumscribed by \u00a7 387j(c), Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests squarely fit within that zone.  This is not a \ncase where \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Lexmark, 572 \nU.S. at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nFDA simply is wrong that because a marketing \ndenial order is facially directed to the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer), it \u201cregulates only the applicant.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 14.  FDA\u2019s October 12, 2023 marketing denial \nletter (i.e., order), App. 9a, declares that the Vuse   \ne-cigarette products at issue are both \u201cmisbranded\u201d \n\n11 \n \n \nand \u201cadulterated,\u201d and are prohibited from being \n\u201cintroduce[d] or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate \ncommerce.\u201d \n \nId. \n10a, \n14a. \n \nFDA \nacknowledges \nthat \n\u201c[i]f \na \nmanufacturer \nlacks \nauthorization to sell a product, retailers cannot \nlawfully obtain and resell it.\u201d  FDA Br. at 14; see        \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (prohibiting \u201c[t]he introduction or \ndelivery for introduction into interstate commerce of \nany . . . tobacco product . . . that is adulterated or \nmisbranded\u201d).  What FDA refers to as an \u201cindirect \neffect\u201d of a marketing denial order, FDA Br. at 14, can \nhave \ndirect \nand \nserious \nconsequences \nfor \nnoncompliant retailers.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 \n(Penalties); id. \u00a7 333(a)(1) (criminal penalties for \n\u201c[a]ny person who violates a provision of section 331\u201d) \n(emphasis added); id. \u00a7 333(f)(9) (civil monetary \npenalties for violation of tobacco product requirements \nby \u201c[a]ny person\u201d) (emphasis added); see also 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E) (seizure of \u201c[a]ny adulterated or \nmisbranded tobacco product\u201d).   \n \nFDA\u2019s brief alleges that Respondent retailers \nengaged in \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by selling e-cigarettes \nboth \nbefore \nand \nafter \ndenial \nof \nmarketing \nauthorization.  FDA Br. at 8.  This assertion not only \nis unfounded, but also disingenuous in light of FDA\u2019s \npublicly announced compliance/enforcement policy \nallowing certain preexisting e-cigarettes to remain on \nthe market pending submission and review of \nmarketing authorization applications.  See 81 Fed. \nReg. at 28,977.  Nonetheless, FDA\u2019s insinuation that \nRespondent retailers may be in legal jeopardy in light \n\n12 \n \n \nof the marketing denial order underscores why they \nare adversely affected by the denial. \n \n3.  As the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying FDA\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss or Transfer reflects, the agency\u2019s \narguments \nthat \nRespondent \nretailers \nare \nnot \nadversely affected by the marketing authorization \ndenial for purposes of seeking judicial review under   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) are \u201cunavailing.\u201d  App. 4a.  Indeed, FDA\u2019s \ncontention that Respondent retailers lack statutory \nstanding defies common sense, especially in view of \nthe undisputed evidence that Respondent Avail Vapor \nTexas would go out of business if the denial order goes \ninto effect.  Id.   \n \nThe Court held in Lexmark, a frequently cited case \non statutory standing, that \u201calleg[ing] an injury to a \ncommercial interest in reputation or sales\u201d was \nenough to satisfy the zone of interests for the false \nadvertising statute involved in that case.  572 U.S. at \n132; cf.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin a case to satisfy Article III standing requirements).  \nGiven the injury to their commercial interests, i.e., \nsales, and possibly reputational harm, that they will \nsuffer if FDA\u2019s marketing denial goes into effect, \nRespondent retailers have enough of a personal stake \n\n13 \n \n \nin this case, i.e., statutory as well as Article III \nstanding, to challenge FDA\u2019s denial order.5   \n \n4.  The Court should take a broader view of the \napplicable zone of interests than the \u00a7 387j(c) \nmarketing denial procedures on which FDA predicates \nit superficial statutory standing arguments.  Section \n387j(c) also contains a statutory standard for granting \nor denying new tobacco product, including e-cigarette, \nmarketing applications: \u201cprotection of the public \nhealth.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 387j(c)(2)(A), 387j(c)(4), \n387j(c)(5)(A).   \n \nAs indicated above, FDA determined that retail \nsales of certain preexisting e-cigarette products could \ncontinue pending submission and review of marketing \nauthorization applications.  FDA\u2019s stated rationale for \nthis carefully considered compliance/enforcement \n \n5 In Lexmark the Court criticized use of the term \u201cprudential \nstanding\u201d as \u201cmisleading\u201d  because \u201cdeclin[ing] to adjudicate [a] \nclaim \non \ngrounds \nthat \nare \n\u2018prudential,\u2019 \nrather \nthan \nconstitutional\u201d where a plaintiff has Article III standing (as \nRespondents do here) \u201cis in some tension with [the Court\u2019s] \nreaffirmation of the principle that a federal court\u2019s obligation to \nhear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually \nunflagging.\u201d  572 U.S. at 125-26; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. \nCity of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017) (\u201cIn Lexmark we said \nthat the label \u2018prudential standing\u2019 was misleading, for the \nrequirement at issue is in reality is tied to a particular statute.  \nThe question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause \nof action that he asserts.\u201d). Thus, referring to \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d in connection with a statute\u2019s zone of interests is more \napt.  Id. at 1302-03.         \n\n14 \n \n \npolicy was in part protection of public health\u2014\nspecifically, continuing to make certain e-cigarette \nproducts available to adults who want \u201cto transition \naway from combusted tobacco use.\u201d  81 Fed. Reg. at \n28,977. Retailers\u2019 commercial interests in continuing \nto make such e-cigarette products available to \ncombusted-tobacco transitioning adults align with the \npublic health-related interests identified by FDA and \nexpressly incorporated into \u00a7 387j(c).  In other words, \nby making e-cigarettes available to the adult public, \nRespondent retailers facilitate the public health \ninterests that FDA has identified.  FDA\u2019s public health \nrationale is another reason why Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests are adversely affected by FDA\u2019s marketing \nauthorization denial, and thus, why the retailers have \nstatutory standing to seek judicial review.  Cf. Env\u2019t \nDef. Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. \n1970) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected \nby the [pesticide registration] statute includes not \nonly the economic interest of the registrant but also \nthe interest of the public in safety.\u201d). \n \n5.  In short, this Court, like the court of appeals, \nshould follow a common-sense approach and affirm \nthat the Respondent retailers have statutory standing \nto challenge FDA\u2019s marketing denial.  \nC. This Court\u2019s ruling may affect the \navailability of judicial review under \nnumerous other statutes  \n \nAccording to a recent survey conducted for the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States, there \n\n15 \n \n \nare \u201cover 650 specific judicial review provisions in the \nUnited States Code.\u201d  Jonathan R.

ALF\u2019s mission is to advance the rule \nof law and civil justice by advocating for individual \nliberty, free enterprise, property rights, limited and \nresponsible government, sound science in judicial and \nregulatory proceedings, and effective education, \nincluding parental rights and school choice.  With the \nbenefit of guidance from the distinguished legal \nscholars, corporate legal officers, private practitioners, \nbusiness executives, and prominent scientists who \nserve on its Board of Directors and Advisory Council, \nALF pursues its mission by participating as amicus \ncuriae in carefully selected appeals before the \nSupreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and state \nsupreme courts.  See atlanticlegal.org. \n* * * \n  \nThis \nappeal \nconcerns \nthe \nability \nof \nthe \nmanufacturer and retailers of a federally regulated \nproduct to jointly challenge, in a single federal court of \nappeals, a final agency action that directly and \nindisputably \nimpairs \ntheir \nshared \ncommercial \ninterests.  Petitioner Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or part, and \nno party or counsel other than the amicus curiae and its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n \n \n\n2 \n \n \npersistent efforts to block the Fifth Circuit from \nreviewing the regulatory action at issue\u2014denial of \n\u201cpremarket\u201d \nauthorization \nthat \nwould \nallow \nRespondents \nto \ncontinue \nselling \nVuse \n\u201cAlto\u201d   \ne-cigarettes\u2014trigger ALF\u2019s missions of advocating for \ncivil justice, responsible government, and free \nenterprise.  \n \nALF \ntakes \nno \nposition \non \nthe \nmerits \nof \nRespondents\u2019 challenge to FDA\u2019s denial of marketing \nauthorization for Vuse Alto e-cigarettes.  Instead, this \namicus brief focuses on the question of whether a Vuse \ne-cigarette retailer has statutory standing to obtain \njudicial review of FDA\u2019s denial.  At least one retailer, \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C., has been \nselling Vuse e-cigarettes since before FDA decided to \ndeny authorization to market them as \u201cnew tobacco \nproducts\u201d under the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387 et seq.2 \nAvail has stated that it \u201cwould \u2018cease business \noperations\u2019 if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into effect.\u201d  \nApp. 5a.3 \n \n2 The TCA was enacted in 2009 as subchapter IX of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.  In 2016 \nFDA deemed e-cigarettes to be \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d subject to \nthe TCA.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j; 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, \n2016).     \n3 The Fifth Circuit has stayed FDA\u2019s marketing denial pending \ndisposition of this appeal.  See Brief for the Petitioners (\u201cFDA \nBr.\u201d) at 7.    \n\n3 \n \n \n \nIn its Order denying FDA\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or \nTransfer, the Fifth Circuit held\u2014not surprisingly\u2014 \nthat the TCA \u201cgrants the Petitioners [Respondents \nhere] statutory standing to challenge FDA decisions \nthat affect them.\u201d  App. 4a.  \u201cAll the Petitioners have \nstatutory standing as \u2018person[s] adversely affected\u2019 \nunder the [TCA].\u201d  Id. 5a (quoting 21 U.S.C.    \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1)).       \n \nThis Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order.  \nIndeed, ALF believes that the question of statutory \nstanding \npresented \nin \nthis \ncase \ntranscends   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), the TCA judicial review provision at issue.  \nHaving granted certiorari, the Court now has an \nimportant opportunity to reaffirm, or at least clarify, \nthe breadth of a statute-specific right to judicial \nreview that encompasses \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a final agency action.4    \n \n4 ALF defers to Respondents as to why the Court also should \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling on the equally important \nquestion of whether venue under \u00a7 387l(a)(1) must be satisfied \nindependently by each joint petitioner for judicial review of an \nFDA tobacco product marketing denial.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes and two of the same Respondents as \nhere\u2014R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) and Mississippi \nPetroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association\u2014the \nFifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in this circuit.\u201d    \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA (\u201cRJRV\u201d), 65 F.4th 182, 188   \n(5th Cir. 2023); see also App. 4a (\u201cStare decisis governs venue   \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThis Court, like the Fifth Circuit, should reject \nFDA\u2019s narrow and self-serving interpretation of the \nTCA judicial review provision at issue, 21 U.S.C.        \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1).  That plainly and broadly worded \nprovision entitles \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by \nan FDA \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d (e.g., e-cigarette) \nmarketing authorization denial to file a petition for \njudicial review (emphasis added).  But FDA argues \nthat  \u00a7 387l(a)(1) applies only to manufacturers.  \nPlacing form over substance, FDA contends that   \ne-cigarette retailers are excluded because despite the \neconomic consequences they suffer where, as here, the \nagency denies an e-cigarette marketing authorization, \nit is the manufacturer that submits the application for \nmarketing approval and that is the addressee on \nFDA\u2019s denial order.    \n \nhere so long as the distributors have standing, which they do.\u201d). \n     FDA\u2019s elaborate but strained arguments that Respondent \nretailers lack statutory standing are part of its attempt to keep \nthis appeal (and related Vuse e-cigarette appeals) out of the   \nFifth Circuit.  The agency\u2019s effort to compel RJRV to pursue its \nchallenge to FDA\u2019s Vuse e-cigarette marketing denials in either \nthe D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit\u2014which FDA claims \nalready have rejected the principal legal theory on which RJRV\u2019s \nchallenge relies\u2014is no less a type of \u201cforum shopping\u201d than what \nFDA accuses the Fifth Circuit of condoning.  See FDA Br. at 4-5; \nsee also App. 5a.        \n\n5 \n \n \n \nFDA\u2019s convoluted arguments about statutory \nstanding defy common sense, as well as the text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), which refers to judicial review of a \n\u201cdenial,\u201d not of a denial \u201corder.\u201d  The Court should \nview the zone of interests for determining who is \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by a marketing denial, and thus \nhas the right to judicial review, as leniently for  \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) as it does for the Administrative \nProcedure Act\u2019s almost identically worded judicial \nreview provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that the benefit of any doubt \nshould go to the plaintiff, here the Respondents,  \nincluding the retailers.  \n \nThere are many additional federal statutes \ncontaining judicial review provisions that expressly \napply to any person adversely affected by a final \nagency action.  If this Court were to adopt FDA\u2019s \nnarrow, superficial, and inflexible approach for \nidentifying the zone of interests for statutory standing \npurposes, a great variety of businesses subject to other \nfederal statutes may be deprived of the opportunity to \nchallenge agency actions that are detrimental to their \neconomic, \nreputational, \nand/or \nother \ninterests.  \nInstead, the Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Respondent retailers, as well as \nRespondent RJRV, have statutory standing to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s e-cigarette marketing denial.   \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nRespondent E-Cigarette Retailers   \nHave Statutory Standing \n \nA. The judicial review provision should be \nconstrued broadly   \n \nSection \u00a7 387l(a)(1) states in part that \u201cany person \nadversely affected by . . . denial [of a \u201cnew tobacco \nproduct\u201d marketing application] may file a petition for \njudicial review of such . . . denial.\u201d  FDA argues that \nthis broadly worded judicial review provision is \nlimited to manufacturers.  The agency\u2019s contrived \ncontention that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) excludes e-cigarette \nretailers is wrong.  It is an advocacy position \ncalculated to prevent the Fifth Circuit\u2014where venue \nunquestionably \nis \nproper \nfor \nthe \nRespondent \nretailers\u2014from addressing the merits of FDA\u2019s Vuse \ne-cigarette marketing denials.  In a related appeal \ninvolving Vuse e-cigarettes, the Fifth Circuit not only \nhas held that venue is proper, see supra n. 4, but also \nthat success on the merits is likely.  See RJRV, 65 \nF.4th at 188, 189-94.     \n \n1.  According to FDA, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \u201cshows no . . . \nsolicitude for retailers.\u201d  FDA Br. at 7.  FDA argues \nthat the marketing denial \u201corder that FDA issues . . . \nspeaks to the applicant alone (always or nearly always \na manufacturer of the product) and affects retailers \nonly indirectly.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  The term \n\u201corder,\u201d however, does not appear in  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \nwhich instead twice refers more broadly to judicial \nreview of a \u201cdenial.\u201d  Other subsections of  \u00a7 387l do \n\n7 \n \n \nrefer to a denial \u201corder.\u201d  See, e.g., \u00a7 387l(a)(2)(B) \n(Record of proceedings);  387l(b) (Standard of review).  \nBut unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1), these and other subsections \nthat facilitate judicial review of marketing denial \norders do not specify who is entitled to file a petition \nfor review of such an order.   \n \nIf Congress had wanted to limit the right to judicial \nreview of denials to applicants for marketing \nauthorization, it would have said so in \u00a7 387l(a)(1), as \nit did in connection with FDA withdrawals of \nmarketing authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) \n(referring to \u201c[t]he holder of an application subject to \n[a withdrawal] order\u201d).  Instead, \u00a7 387l(a)(1) expressly \nauthorizes a petition for judicial review of a marketing \ndenial to be filed by \u201cany person adversely affected by \nsuch . . .  denial\u201d (emphasis added).  This is \u201can \nauthorization of remarkable breadth.\u201d  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 164 (1997).  As the Fifth Circuit \nobserved in its Order here, \u201c\u2018[w]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019\u201d  \nApp. 4a (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. \n16, 23 (1983)).    \n \n2.  Turning a blind eye to the plain text of   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), FDA invokes the \u201czone of interests\u201d test \nfor statutory standing to sue.  FDA Br. at 12. In so \ndoing, FDA glosses over the broad, unambiguous \nlanguage of   \u00a7 387l(a)(1)\u2014language that is virtually \nidentical to the omnibus Administrative Procedure \n\n8 \n \n \nAct (APA) judicial review provision, which states that \n\u201c[a] person . . . adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action. . . is entitled to judicial review.\u201d   \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.  The Court repeatedly has explained \nthat in the APA context the zone of interests test \u201cis \nnot especially demanding . . . the benefit of any doubt \ngoes to the plaintiff.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012).  Given the close \nsimilarity in statutory language, the same \u201clenient \napproach\u201d that this Court affords to the APA\u2019s judicial \nreview provision, Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, should \napply to the right to judicial review under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1).   \n \nB. FDA\u2019s marketing denial adversely affects \nRespondent retailers \n \n1.  Unable to avoid the fact that \u00a7 387l(a)(1) \nexpressly refers to \u201cany person\u201d\u2014not merely to an \napplicant for marketing authorization\u2014FDA argues \nthat the zone of interests test governs the meaning of \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d in \u00a7 387l(a)(1) and precludes \nretailers from \u201cchalleng[ing] an order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s \napplication \nfor \nmarketing \nauthorization.\u201d  FDA Br. at 13.  Under the zone of \ninterests test, courts \u201cpresume that a statutory cause \nof action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law \ninvoked.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 129 (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Nat\u2019l \nWildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990) (\u201c[T]o be \n\n9 \n \n \n\u2018adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the \nmeaning\u2019 of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that \nthe injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the \nadverse effect upon him) falls within the \u2018zone of \ninterests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statutory \nprovision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \ncomplaint.\u201d). \n \nBecause the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue . . . what \ncomes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative \naction under the generous review provisions of the \nAPA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FDA \nis mistaken this potential distinction between the APA \nand a statute-specific judicial review provision means \nthat the lenient approach afforded to the zone of \ninterests test in APA judicial review cases \u201cdoes not   \n. . . carry over to other statutes.\u201d  FDA Br. at 12.  \nNonetheless, seizing upon what it erroneously asserts \nis a categorical difference between APA and non-APA \ncases, FDA argues that for purposes of seeking judicial \nreview of a marketing denial under  \u00a7 387l(a)(1), \u201c[a] \nretailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 13. \n \n2.  FDA points to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387j(c) as the TCA \nprovision whose zone of interests supposedly governs \nthe right of any adversely affected person to obtain \njudicial review of marketing denials.  That section, \ntitled \u201cAction on application,\u201d establishes procedures \n\n10 \n \n \nand standards for FDA\u2019s review of a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for a \u201cnew tobacco product\u201d marketing \nauthorization, including for e-cigarettes.  See RJRV, \n65 F.4th at 187-88 (summarizing TCA statutory and \nregulatory background); Wages & White Lion Invests., \nLLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2024)  \n(en banc) (same).  \n  \nAccording to FDA, \u00a7 387j(c) \u201cprotects  . . . only the \ninterests of the applicant itself,\u201d not \u201cthe interests of \nretail sellers of the applicant\u2019s products.\u201d  FDA Br. at \n14.  Elevating form over substance, FDA asserts that \nbecause a marketing approval or denial order under   \n\u00a7 387j(c) is \u201cissued to the applicant alone,\u201d id., retail \nsellers of the product are not encompassed by    \n\u00a7 387j(c)\u2019s zone of interests. \n \nEven assuming that the right to judicial review \nunder \u00a7 387l(a)(1) is limited to the zone of interests \ncircumscribed by \u00a7 387j(c), Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests squarely fit within that zone.  This is not a \ncase where \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Lexmark, 572 \nU.S. at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nFDA simply is wrong that because a marketing \ndenial order is facially directed to the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer), it \u201cregulates only the applicant.\u201d  FDA \nBr. at 14.  FDA\u2019s October 12, 2023 marketing denial \nletter (i.e., order), App. 9a, declares that the Vuse   \ne-cigarette products at issue are both \u201cmisbranded\u201d \n\n11 \n \n \nand \u201cadulterated,\u201d and are prohibited from being \n\u201cintroduce[d] or delivered for introduction into \ninterstate \ncommerce.\u201d \n \nId. \n10a, \n14a. \n \nFDA \nacknowledges \nthat \n\u201c[i]f \na \nmanufacturer \nlacks \nauthorization to sell a product, retailers cannot \nlawfully obtain and resell it.\u201d  FDA Br. at 14; see        \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (prohibiting \u201c[t]he introduction or \ndelivery for introduction into interstate commerce of \nany . . . tobacco product . . . that is adulterated or \nmisbranded\u201d).  What FDA refers to as an \u201cindirect \neffect\u201d of a marketing denial order, FDA Br. at 14, can \nhave \ndirect \nand \nserious \nconsequences \nfor \nnoncompliant retailers.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 \n(Penalties); id. \u00a7 333(a)(1) (criminal penalties for \n\u201c[a]ny person who violates a provision of section 331\u201d) \n(emphasis added); id. \u00a7 333(f)(9) (civil monetary \npenalties for violation of tobacco product requirements \nby \u201c[a]ny person\u201d) (emphasis added); see also 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 334(a)(2)(E) (seizure of \u201c[a]ny adulterated or \nmisbranded tobacco product\u201d).   \n \nFDA\u2019s brief alleges that Respondent retailers \nengaged in \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by selling e-cigarettes \nboth \nbefore \nand \nafter \ndenial \nof \nmarketing \nauthorization.  FDA Br. at 8.  This assertion not only \nis unfounded, but also disingenuous in light of FDA\u2019s \npublicly announced compliance/enforcement policy \nallowing certain preexisting e-cigarettes to remain on \nthe market pending submission and review of \nmarketing authorization applications.  See 81 Fed. \nReg. at 28,977.  Nonetheless, FDA\u2019s insinuation that \nRespondent retailers may be in legal jeopardy in light \n\n12 \n \n \nof the marketing denial order underscores why they \nare adversely affected by the denial. \n \n3.  As the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Order denying FDA\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss or Transfer reflects, the agency\u2019s \narguments \nthat \nRespondent \nretailers \nare \nnot \nadversely affected by the marketing authorization \ndenial for purposes of seeking judicial review under   \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1) are \u201cunavailing.\u201d  App. 4a.  Indeed, FDA\u2019s \ncontention that Respondent retailers lack statutory \nstanding defies common sense, especially in view of \nthe undisputed evidence that Respondent Avail Vapor \nTexas would go out of business if the denial order goes \ninto effect.  Id.   \n \nThe Court held in Lexmark, a frequently cited case \non statutory standing, that \u201calleg[ing] an injury to a \ncommercial interest in reputation or sales\u201d was \nenough to satisfy the zone of interests for the false \nadvertising statute involved in that case.  572 U.S. at \n132; cf.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, \n2203 (2021) (a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \nin a case to satisfy Article III standing requirements).  \nGiven the injury to their commercial interests, i.e., \nsales, and possibly reputational harm, that they will \nsuffer if FDA\u2019s marketing denial goes into effect, \nRespondent retailers have enough of a personal stake \n\n13 \n \n \nin this case, i.e., statutory as well as Article III \nstanding, to challenge FDA\u2019s denial order.5   \n \n4.  The Court should take a broader view of the \napplicable zone of interests than the \u00a7 387j(c) \nmarketing denial procedures on which FDA predicates \nit superficial statutory standing arguments.  Section \n387j(c) also contains a statutory standard for granting \nor denying new tobacco product, including e-cigarette, \nmarketing applications: \u201cprotection of the public \nhealth.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 387j(c)(2)(A), 387j(c)(4), \n387j(c)(5)(A).   \n \nAs indicated above, FDA determined that retail \nsales of certain preexisting e-cigarette products could \ncontinue pending submission and review of marketing \nauthorization applications.  FDA\u2019s stated rationale for \nthis carefully considered compliance/enforcement \n \n5 In Lexmark the Court criticized use of the term \u201cprudential \nstanding\u201d as \u201cmisleading\u201d  because \u201cdeclin[ing] to adjudicate [a] \nclaim \non \ngrounds \nthat \nare \n\u2018prudential,\u2019 \nrather \nthan \nconstitutional\u201d where a plaintiff has Article III standing (as \nRespondents do here) \u201cis in some tension with [the Court\u2019s] \nreaffirmation of the principle that a federal court\u2019s obligation to \nhear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually \nunflagging.\u201d  572 U.S. at 125-26; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. \nCity of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017) (\u201cIn Lexmark we said \nthat the label \u2018prudential standing\u2019 was misleading, for the \nrequirement at issue is in reality is tied to a particular statute.  \nThe question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause \nof action that he asserts.\u201d). Thus, referring to \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d in connection with a statute\u2019s zone of interests is more \napt.  Id. at 1302-03.         \n\n14 \n \n \npolicy was in part protection of public health\u2014\nspecifically, continuing to make certain e-cigarette \nproducts available to adults who want \u201cto transition \naway from combusted tobacco use.\u201d  81 Fed. Reg. at \n28,977. Retailers\u2019 commercial interests in continuing \nto make such e-cigarette products available to \ncombusted-tobacco transitioning adults align with the \npublic health-related interests identified by FDA and \nexpressly incorporated into \u00a7 387j(c).  In other words, \nby making e-cigarettes available to the adult public, \nRespondent retailers facilitate the public health \ninterests that FDA has identified.  FDA\u2019s public health \nrationale is another reason why Respondent retailers\u2019 \ninterests are adversely affected by FDA\u2019s marketing \nauthorization denial, and thus, why the retailers have \nstatutory standing to seek judicial review.  Cf. Env\u2019t \nDef. Fund v. Hardin, 428 F.2d 1093, 1096 (D.C. Cir. \n1970) (\u201cThe \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected \nby the [pesticide registration] statute includes not \nonly the economic interest of the registrant but also \nthe interest of the public in safety.\u201d). \n \n5.  In short, this Court, like the court of appeals, \nshould follow a common-sense approach and affirm \nthat the Respondent retailers have statutory standing \nto challenge FDA\u2019s marketing denial.  \nC. This Court\u2019s ruling may affect the \navailability of judicial review under \nnumerous other statutes  \n \nAccording to a recent survey conducted for the \nAdministrative Conference of the United States, there \n\n15 \n \n \nare \u201cover 650 specific judicial review provisions in the \nUnited States Code.\u201d  Jonathan R. Siegel, The ACUS \nSourcebook of Federal Judicial Review Statutes, \nAdmin. Conf. of the U.S. 37 (Jan. 2022).  Dozens of \nthem, in addition to the APA and \u00a7 387l(a)(1), afford \njudicial review to any person adversely affected by an \nagency action.  See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360g(a)(9) \n(medical devices); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348(g) (food additives); \n7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136n(b) (pesticides); 15 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 2060(a) & \n2064(j)(2) (Consumer Product Safety Commission \nrules);  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) (Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission citations).  \n      If adopted by this Court, the constricted, form-\nover-substance zone of interests interpretation that \nFDA is advocating here as a way of avoiding review in \nthe Fifth Circuit may have repercussions for judicial-\nreview-seeking adversely affected businesses and \nindividuals far beyond the world of e-cigarettes.  \nAlthough the \u201cbreadth of the zone of interests varies \naccording to the provisions of law at issue,\u201d Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 163, the Court should adopt and apply the \nsame \u201clenient approach\u201d for statute-specific judicial \nreview provisions as it has for judicial review under \nthe APA.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  At the very least \nthe Court should do so for judicial review provisions \nwhich, like \u00a7 387l(a)(1), use language that is identical \nor nearly identical to \u201cthe APA\u2019s omnibus judicial-\nreview provision,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, \u201cas an appropriate \nmeans of preserving the flexibility\u201d of such broad \nentitlements to judicial review.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n130.    \n\n16 \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the Court should hold, at least \nfor judicial review provisions that expressly apply to \nany person adversely affected by an agency action, \nthat the zone of interests test is whether \u201cthe interest \nsought to be protected by the complainant is arguably \nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or \nregulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in \nquestion.\u201d  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  The \nCourt has \u201coften \u2018conspicuously included the word \n\u201carguably\u201d in the test to indicate that the benefit of \nany doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u2019\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n130 (quoting Patchak, 567 U.S. at 225).  \n \nThe Court did exactly that in Bank of America \nCorp. v. City of Miami, which involved Fair Housing \nAct statute-specific judicial review provisions that \n\u201callow[] any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 to file a civil action \nseeking damages for a violation of the statute.\u201d  137   \nS. Ct.  at 1300.  Plaintiff City of Miami filed suit \nagainst two banks for allegedly violating the Act.  This \nCourt held that \u201cthe City\u2019s claimed injuries fall within \nthe zone of interests that the FHA arguably protects.\u201d  \nId. at 1301 (emphasis added). \n \nAs Justice Scalia recognized in Bennett, finding \nstatutory standing where a plaintiff\u2019s interests are at \nleast \u201carguably\u201d within a statute\u2019s zone of interests is \nappropriate because a plaintiff (or petitioner in a court \nof appeals) still must satisfy the \u201cimmutable \nrequirements of Article III,\u201d  520 U.S. at 162, which \nFDA apparently recognizes Respondents satisfy here.  \nThere is no principled reason why plaintiffs (or court \n\n17 \n \n \nof appeals petitioners) that invoke statute-specific \njudicial review provisions should be deprived of the \nsame broad view that is applied in challenges arising \nunder the APA.  For the reasons already discussed, the \nretailers\u2019 interests in challenging FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial are not merely arguably, but squarely, within \nthe TCA\u2019s zone of interests.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, resulting from a search for the Respondents' merits brief, did not yield that document. Instead, it returned the Respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for certiorari, a document I have previously analyzed. Therefore, this observation does not introduce new substantive legal arguments but serves to confirm and reinforce my existing, detailed model of the Respondents' position. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) are preserved and solidified, but not fundamentally altered.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the case's legal landscape is now as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable):** My understanding of the government's case remains complete and unchanged, derived from their merits brief. The FDA argues for a narrow, structural interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA), asserting that only the manufacturer-applicant can seek judicial review of a marketing denial order. The core pillars are:\n    1.  **Zone of Interests:** The review provision (\u00a7 387l) is contextually linked to and limited by the application process (\u00a7 387j), meaning only the applicant falls within the statute's zone of interests for judicial review.\n    2.  **Implicit Preclusion:** The specific and detailed review pathway provided for applicants implicitly precludes other parties, like retailers, from seeking review.\n    3.  **Independent Venue:** Each petitioner in a joint action must independently satisfy the venue requirements.\n    4.  **Forum Shopping:** Allowing retailers to establish venue would sanction strategic forum shopping, undermining the congressionally intended venues (the D.C. Circuit or the manufacturer's home circuit).\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Confirmed and Solidified):** This observation confirms that the BIO is an accurate and robust blueprint of the Respondents' case. While I still lack the final merits brief, my confidence in the core tenets of their argument is now higher. The confirmed arguments are:\n    1.  **Expansive Textualism:** The central argument rests on the plain meaning of \"any person adversely affected\" (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1)). Citing precedents like *United States v. Gonzales*, Respondents argue \"any\" has an expansive meaning. A retailer who is legally prohibited from selling a product and faces substantial revenue loss is unambiguously \"adversely affected.\"\n    2.  **Permissive \"Zone of Interests\" Test:** The BIO confirms their reliance on the principle that the zone-of-interests test is not demanding (*Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami*). They argue the relevant \"zone\" is not just the application section but the entire TCA, which pervasively regulates, fines, and inspects retailers, thus placing them squarely within its scope of protection and regulation.\n    3.  **Procedural Defenses (Forfeiture & Poor Vehicle):** The observation reinforces the importance of Respondents' procedural arguments. They contend the FDA forfeited its \"independent venue\" argument by failing to raise it properly below, offering the Court a procedural off-ramp to avoid the main question. They also characterize the case as a \"poor vehicle\" for interlocutory review of a \"splitless\" issue.\n    4.  **Rejection of \"Forum Shopping\" Narrative:** Respondents frame their action not as \"shopping\" but as a simple exercise of a clear statutory right for the retailers to file a petition in the circuit where they reside and do business.\n\nIn summary, this observation was a negative search result that paradoxically strengthened my existing beliefs. It confirmed the arguments I had previously extracted from the BIO without providing the new information I sought from the merits brief. The central legal conflict remains a clash between the FDA's narrow, purpose-driven structuralism and RJR's broad, rights-conferring textualism. The primary effect of this observation is to increase my confidence in my model of the Respondents' case while simultaneously highlighting that the final, definitive articulation in their merits brief is the most critical piece of outstanding evidence.",

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, the amicus brief from the Atlantic Legal Foundation (ALF) in support of the Respondents, provides the first external validation and significant expansion of the Respondents' legal arguments. It introduces a powerful new line of reasoning that reframes the case from a narrow statutory dispute into a major question of administrative law. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) are substantially updated and deepened.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the case's legal landscape is now as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable):** My understanding of the government's case remains complete and unchanged, derived from their merits brief. The FDA argues for a narrow, purpose-driven, structural interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA). The core pillars remain:\n    1.  **Zone of Interests:** The review provision (\u00a7 387l) is contextually limited to the application process (\u00a7 387j), meaning only the applicant-manufacturer falls within the statute's zone of interests.\n    2.  **Implicit Preclusion:** The specific review pathway for applicants implicitly precludes others.\n    3.  **Independent Venue:** Each petitioner must independently satisfy venue requirements.\n    4.  **Forum Shopping:** Allowing retailers to establish venue sanctions strategic forum shopping.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Significantly Strengthened and Broadened):** The ALF amicus brief provides powerful new arguments and legal authority that reinforce and expand upon the position I had previously modeled from the BIO.\n    1.  **Expansive Textualism (Reinforced):** The ALF brief strongly supports the plain-meaning interpretation of \"any person adversely affected\" (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1)). It adds weight by citing *Bennett v. Spear*, which described such language as an \"authorization of remarkable breadth,\" and explicitly argues for applying the same \"lenient approach\" to the zone-of-interests test that the Court uses for the nearly identical language in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), where the \"benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff\" (*Lexmark*).\n    2.  **Direct vs. Indirect Harm (Clarified):** The brief sharpens the counterargument to the FDA's claim that retailers are only \"indirectly\" affected. ALF argues the effect is direct and severe. A marketing denial order renders the products \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated,\" exposing retailers not just to economic loss (like Avail Vapor going out of business) but also to direct federal penalties, including criminal liability, civil fines, and product seizure (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331, 333, 334). This reframes the injury from a mere loss of future sales to an immediate and tangible legal risk.\n    3.  **Procedural Defenses (Stable):** My belief in the importance of the Respondents' forfeiture and \"poor vehicle\" arguments remains unchanged.\n    4.  **Neutralizing the \"Forum Shopping\" Narrative (New Insight):** The ALF brief cleverly reframes the forum shopping issue, characterizing the FDA's own \"persistent efforts to block the Fifth Circuit from reviewing\" the case as a form of reverse forum shopping. This neutralizes the government's pejorative framing and recasts the dispute as one where both parties are acting strategically, urging the Court to focus on the plain statutory text that grants the retailers the right to sue where they reside.\n\n*   **New Dimension: Systemic Implications for Administrative Law (Major Update):** The most critical new information from this observation is the introduction of a broad, principled argument that transcends the TCA.\n    *   **Argument:** The ALF brief argues that the phrase \"any person adversely affected\" is a standard feature in the judicial review provisions of dozens of other federal statutes regulating everything from medical devices and pesticides to consumer products.\n    *   **Impact:** This elevates the case from a niche statutory interpretation question to a major administrative law precedent. A ruling for the FDA, adopting its \"constricted, form-over-substance\" interpretation, could have a domino effect, stripping a wide variety of businesses of their ability to seek judicial review of agency actions that cause them direct economic harm.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This argument is likely to appeal to Justices concerned with checking the power of the administrative state and ensuring broad access to courts for regulated parties. It provides a principled basis to rule for the Respondents that is independent of the specific facts or policy questions related to e-cigarettes.\n\nIn summary, this amicus brief significantly strengthens my model of the Respondents' case. It adds new legal authority (*Bennett v. Spear*), sharpens the rebuttal to the FDA's core arguments, and, most importantly, introduces a powerful systemic argument about the future of judicial review in the administrative state. The central conflict is now more clearly a clash between the FDA's narrow structuralism and a broad textualist principle with far-reaching implications. My confidence in the strength of the Respondents' legal position has increased, as they now have a compelling argument that will resonate with the Court's interest in foundational administrative law principles. The Respondents' merits brief remains the key piece of missing evidence, but this filing strongly suggests it will feature this systemic argument prominently.",

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 28,977 (May 10, 2016); see \nalso id. at 29,001 (\u201cas a practical effect of the Agency\u2019s \ncompliance \npolicy \u2026 FDA \nexpects \nthat \nmany \nmanufacturers \u2026 will continue to market their products\u201d); \nFDA, Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery \nSystems and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without \nPremarket Authorization 27 (Apr. 2020). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStores Association (\u201cMississippi Association\u201d), are \nretailers that sell menthol-flavored Vuse Alto. Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.  Where multiple petitioners join a single petition \nfor review of an FDA denial of a marketing \napplication for a tobacco product, whether all \npetitioners may participate in the case if one \npetitioner has established venue. \n\nii \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nR.J.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product.

Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d and \u201ca detrimental influence \non\u201d the retailer Respondents\u2019 interests, since they \ncannot sell the product at issue and if they do, will be \nsubject to severe penalties, see infra p. 12. Therefore, \nunder the plain text, retailer Respondents are \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s order. \nb. FDA tries to escape the statute\u2019s plain text by \nemphasizing that \u201c\u2018adversely affected\u2019 is a term of art \nin administrative law,\u201d Pet. 11, but the Agency fares \nno better under this Court\u2019s statutory standing \njurisprudence. The zone-of-interests test that this \nCourt has applied to determine when a party is \nsufficiently aggrieved to challenge agency action \u201cis \nnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). A party has \nstatutory standing if it asserts an interest that is \n\u201carguably\u201d protected or regulated by the statute. \nE.g., id. at 225\u201326. The zone-of-interests test \n\u201cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.\u201d Id. All that is required is \u201csome \nindicia\u2014however slight\u2014that the litigant before the \ncourt \nwas \n[(i)] intended \nto \nbe \nprotected \u2026 or \n[(ii)] regulated by the statute\u201d\u2014either suffices. \nCalumet Indus., Inc. v. Brock, 807 F.2d 225, 228 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986). This is assessed using \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory interpretation.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. \nv. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 197 (2017). And \u201cthe \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u201d Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225. \u201c[F]inancial \ninjury \u2026 satisf[ies] \nthe \n\u2018cause-of-action\u2019 \n(or \n\u2018prudential standing\u2019) requirement.\u201d Bank of Am., \n581 U.S. at 197. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Bank of America\u2014which \ninvolved a statute with virtually identical language \nabout who can sue\u2014controls this case. There, the \nCity of Miami sued several banks under the Fair \nHousing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), alleging that the banks \nengaged in discriminatory lending in the residential \nhousing market that caused the City economic harm. \nIn concluding that the City came within the FHA\u2019s \nzone of interests, the Supreme Court stressed the \ntextual \nbreadth \nof \nthe \nFHA\u2019s \njudicial-review \nprovision: \u201cThe FHA permits any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 \nto bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.\u201d Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)). Because the City \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclaimed that the banks\u2019 lending practices caused the \nCity\u2019s lost tax revenue, the Court concluded the City \nwas at least \u201carguably \u2026 within the FHA\u2019s zone of \ninterests\u201d\u2014even though the City did not suffer \ndiscrimination. Id. at 200\u201301.7 \nGiven this precedent, it is no wonder the Fifth \nCircuit rejected FDA\u2019s argument under the TCA. The \nstatutory language here\u2014\u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d\u2014is, if anything, broader than the FHA\u2019s \n\u201caggrieved person\u201d language. And the connection \nbetween the retailers\u2019 injuries and the interests \nprotected by the TCA is far more direct than the \nconnection between the City\u2019s lost tax revenue in \nBank of America and the FHA. This case thus follows \na fortiori from Bank of America. See also Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 144 S. Ct. 1414, 1423 \n(2024) (holding \u201can insurer such as Truck with \nfinancial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a \n\u2018party in interest\u2019 because it may be directly and \nadversely affected by the reorganization plan\u201d).8  \n \n7 Notably, the government filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of the position this Court adopted. See Brief for U.S. as \nAmicus Curiae Supporting Respondent, Bank of America, 581 \nU.S. 189, 2016 WL 5903233. \n8 The retailers\u2019 interests would establish standing even \nunder Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion in Bank of America. \nJustice Thomas concluded that the City\u2019s asserted injuries (lost \nrevenues and increased costs) did not implicate the interests \nprotected by the FHA. 581 U.S. at 207\u201309. (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part, dissenting in part). Here, there is no \nquestion that the retailers\u2019 injuries (inability to sell a tobacco \nproduct) directly implicate the interests protected by the TCA. \nSee infra p. 12. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nc. \nThis \nstraightforward \ninterpretation \nof \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), moreover, is confirmed by the structure \nof the TCA and statutory context. FDA seems to \nassert that, in allowing \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d to sue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded), Congress actually meant that \u201conly a \nmanufacturer of a product subject to a marketing \ndenial order\u201d or \u201conly an applicant whose premarket \napplication is denied\u201d could sue. But Congress knows \nhow to limit judicial-review provisions in that way, \nand, indeed, did so elsewhere in the TCA itself. \nCompare id. (\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may \nchallenge marketing denial orders for tobacco \nproducts), with id. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) (\u201c[t]he holder of an \napplication\u201d may challenge the withdrawal of \nmarketing authorization for tobacco products). For \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), in contrast, it uses the capacious phrase \n\u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d And \u201c[w]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order 4\u20135 \n(Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 \nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)); see also id. at 5 (\u201cCongress did \nnot limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those \nchallenging a withdrawal order. If the FDA disagrees \nwith Congress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the \n[TCA], its concerns are better directed to Congress \nthan to this court.\u201d). \nCongress also included rulemaking in the TCA\u2019s \njudicial-review provision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (\u201cany \nperson adversely affected by such regulation\u201d \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(emphasis added)). Under FDA\u2019s interpretation, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d would thus mean two \ndifferent \nthings \nin \nthe \nsame \nprovision: \nfor \nrulemaking, \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d means \n\u201cany person adversely affected,\u201d but for a denial \norder, \u201cany person adversely affect\u201d means \u201conly the \nadversely affected manufacturer.\u201d Basic interpretive \nrules reject such a reading. In a given statute, there \nis a presumption of consistent usage: the same term \nusually has the same meaning across different \napplications. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (\u201cTo give these same words [in a statutory \nphrase] a different meaning for each category would \nbe to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d). \nThe evidence that Congress meant what it said \ndoes not stop with the TCA. The U.S. Code is replete \nwith provisions that, unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1) here, \nexpressly limit the class of potential petitioners to \nparties who either played some specific role in the \nadministrative proceedings or satisfy other specified \ncriteria. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1047 (\u201cthe affected \napplicant\u201d) (emphasis added); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4634 (\u201cAny \nparty to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added); 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3247 (\u201cany party to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis \nadded); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (\u201cAny recipient which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 6869 (\u201cIf any \napplicant is dissatisfied\u201d) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 228b-3 (\u201cthe live poultry dealer\u201d) (emphasis added); \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189 (\u201cthe designated organization\u201d) \n(emphasis added); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (\u201cA person who is \nthe primary next of kin\u201d) (emphasis added); 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6717 (\u201cA unit of general local government which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 \n(\u201ca party\u201d to the order) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 7107 \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(\u201ca contractor\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263b (\u201cthe owner or \noperator\u201d) (emphasis added). \nA retailer thus easily falls within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. Bank of Am., 581 U.S. at 197 \n(\u201cclaims of financial injury \u2026 satisfy \u2026 \u2018prudential \nstanding\u2019\u201d). \nd. Looking at the statute more broadly reinforces \nthat retailers are within the zone of interests of both \nthe TCA as a whole and its premarket review \nprovisions in particular. Assessing this question, \ncourts generally ask whether the relevant statute \nregulates or protects the party. Calumet Indus., 807 \nF.2d at 228 (citing Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. \nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). If the \nstatute does, then the party is within the zone and \nhas statutory standing. Here, it is clear that the TCA \nboth regulates and protects retailers.  \nFirst, the TCA directly regulates retailers by: \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nthat FDA does not authorize, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 331, 387b(6); \n\u2022 authorizing seizures, fines, injunctions, and \ncriminal penalties against retailers who sell \nunauthorized products, id. \u00a7 334(a), (g); \n\u00a7 333(a), (f)(9)(A); \u00a7 332(a); \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nwith unauthorized \u201cmodified risk\u201d claims, \nid. \u00a7 387k(a); \n\u2022 requiring retailers to limit the location and \namount of any distribution of free samples \nof tobacco products, id. \u00a7 387a-1(d); \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any cigarette \nadvertisements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; and \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any smokeless \ntobacco product advertisements, id. \u00a7 4402.  \nAmong these numerous provisions, it is notable \nthat a denial order under the TCA dictates what \nproducts a retailer may sell. And FDA\u2019s enforcement \nefforts show that the statute means what it says.

The TCA \nthus obviously regulates tobacco retailers.  \nSecond, the TCA also directly protects retailers by: \n\u2022 preserving retailers\u2019 ability to sell tobacco \nproducts by forbidding FDA from banning \nall cigarettes and certain other product \ncategories, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f; \n\u2022 providing retailers with an opportunity for a \nhearing prior to a no-tobacco-sale order, id. \n\u00a7 333(f)(8); \n\u2022 providing retailers with several procedural \nprotections \nregarding \ncertain \nalleged \nviolations of the Act, id. \u00a7 333 note; and \n\u2022 exempting \nretailers \nfrom \ncertain \nrecordkeeping \nrequirements, \nid. \n\u00a7 387t(b)(5). \nSignificantly for assessing whether retailers fall \nwithin the TCA\u2019s zone of interests, the Act expressly \ndeclares Congress\u2019s purpose \u201cto continue to permit \nthe sale of tobacco products to adults,\u201d including \n \n12 FDA, Advisory and Enforcement Actions Against \nIndustry \nfor \nUnauthorized \nTobacco \nProducts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mrxxt3ja (last visited July 2, 2024). \n13 FDA, FDA Warns 61 Brick and Mortar Retailers for \nthe Sale of Unauthorized E-Cigarettes Popular Among Youth \n(Mar. 26, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mpx2bjky. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nthrough retailers who comply with the TCA. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387 note.

But FDA only points to two \n(inapposite) provisions. The first provision is 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), where Congress provided that \nonly \u201cthe holder of an application\u201d may challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization. As noted \nabove, that provision cuts against FDA because \n\u201cCongress did not limit access to the courts for \nchallenging a denial order in the same way it did for \nthose challenging a withdrawal order.\u201d Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 5 (Feb. 2, 2024). This provision thus \ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to limit \njudicial review when it wanted to, and yet for the \ndenial of a premarket tobacco product application, \nauthorized a challenge by \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by it. See supra pp. 9\u201311. The second \nprovision to which FDA points is \u00a7 387f(c), where \nCongress \nlimited non-manufacturers\u2019 \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninformation \nunder \nthe \nFreedom \nof \nInformation Act. That provision, however, says \nnothing about\u2014and certainly does not contradict\u2014\nthe provision allowing judicial review by \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d Nor does FDA address the \nnumerous provisions that show beyond doubt that \nthe TCA regulates and protects retailers. See supra \npp. 12\u201314. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFDA\u2019s other counterarguments fare no better. FDA \nargues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cnullifies the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions.\u201d Pet. 15. According to FDA, \nthat is because a manufacturer can always find a \nretailer in a preferred circuit and sue there, rather \nthan in the manufacturer\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. \nCircuit. Even if so, the remedy would lie with \nCongress; FDA\u2019s argument does not authorize courts \nto ignore the statute\u2019s plain text. See SAS Inst. Inc. \nv. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1358 (2018) (\u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d).  \nFDA\u2019s argument is, in any event, wrong because \nthe fact that a manufacturer and some retailers may \njoin in a single petition does not render the Act\u2019s \nvenue restrictions a nullity. Venue must still be \nestablished. One petitioner must be located in the \nrelevant circuit unless it is the D.C. Circuit. See \nOrder Granting Mot. to Transfer, Shenzhen Yibo v. \nFDA, No. 24-60191 (5th Cir. May 20, 2024) (granting \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer Shenzhen Yibo\u2019s petition to \nthe D.C. Circuit because there was no local \nretailer).14 In addition, a manufacturer whose \nproducts are only sold in one area of the country \ncannot file wherever the manufacturer wants \nbecause retailers outside that one area would not be \nable to allege injuries in fact. For example, a \nVermont manufacturer that sells its own products \n(as many vape shops do) and is incorporated and \noperates only in Vermont cannot file a petition in the \n \n14 There undoubtedly will be cases where there will not \nbe a retailer who sells or wants to sell the denied product\u2014or at \nleast who is not motivated to pursue litigation. \n\n \n18 \n \n \nFifth Circuit. The venue provision thus operates to \nlimit available forums in that sort of case. But the \nTCA does not entirely shut out of court adversely \naffected retailers that wish to petition in their home \ncircuit. Indeed, under FDA\u2019s theory, a retailer could \nnever challenge a denial order\u2014a position that \nplainly conflicts with the statutory text.  \n2.  FDA poses an alternative argument, but it, too, \nmisses the mark. FDA argues that each petitioner \nmust independently establish venue, so that even if \nAvail and the Mississippi Association have statutory \nstanding and can establish venue, RJRV (which \nconcededly \nhas \nstatutory \nstanding) \nmay \nnot \nparticipate in the case but, instead, must file a \nseparate case in a different court challenging the \nsame denial order. Pet. 12\u201314. This argument is both \nforfeited and wrong. \na. \nAs an initial matter, FDA never advanced this \nargument below. While FDA did object to venue \nrepeatedly in the Fifth Circuit, FDA\u2019s argument was \nthat retailers could not sue at all under the TCA, and \nthat without them venue was not proper. FDA did \nnot, however, argue that each petitioner needed to \nindependently establish venue. That argument \nappeared nowhere in FDA\u2019s Motion to Transfer. It \nappeared \nnowhere \nin \nFDA\u2019s \nOpposition \nto \nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Stay. And it appeared \nnowhere in FDA\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc of \nthe Vibe stay order (or in any other filing). Because \nthis argument \u201cwas never presented to any lower \ncourt,\u201d it is \u201cforfeited.\u201d OBB Personenverkehr AG v. \nSachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 (2015); see also Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \n\n \n19 \n \n \nb. \nIn any event, FDA is wrong. Nothing in the \nstatutory language requires each petitioner to \nindividually establish venue. To the contrary, \nCongress enacted the TCA\u2019s venue provision against \na long-standing backdrop of similarly worded venue \nprovisions governing suits against the government, \nwhich federal courts have uniformly interpreted to \nmean that venue needs to be proper for only one \npetitioner or plaintiff.  \nThe Hobbs Act governs review in the courts of \nappeals of certain actions by a number of federal \nagencies. In language that clearly served as a model \nfor the TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision, the Hobbs \nAct provides that venue shall be \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its \nprincipal office\u201d (or in the D.C. Circuit). 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2343. Courts have uniformly interpreted this \nlanguage to mean that, as long as one petitioner \nresides or has its principal place of business within \nthe circuit, venue is proper for all petitioners. See, \ne.g., Global Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 \nn.1 (5th Cir. 1982); Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 549 F.2d 1186, 1187 n.1 (8th Cir. \n1977); Radio Relay Corp. v. FCC, 409 F.2d 322, 324 \n(2d Cir. 1969); Anglo Canadian Shipping Co. \nv. United States, 238 F.2d 18, 20 (9th Cir. 1956); see \nalso 16 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 3941 n.6 (4th ed. 2023) (\u201cWhen more \nthan one petitioner seeks review of the same order, \nthe venue opportunities may expand considerably.\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the general venue statute authorizes \nsuits against the federal government \u201cin any judicial \ndistrict in which \u2026 the plaintiff resides.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). For over five decades, federal courts \n\n \n20 \n \n \nhave uniformly interpreted that provision to mean \nthat venue can be established by any plaintiff. \nSidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, \n344\u201345 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cEach court faced with the \nsame issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d) (citing \ncases). The government agrees. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Civil Resource Manual 41 Venue (\u201cOnly one \nof the plaintiffs need reside in the district for venue \nto be proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(3).\u201d), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/58msjksk.15 \nThe TCA was enacted in 2009 against this \nlegislative backdrop. \u201cWhen administrative and \njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of \nan existing statutory provision, repetition of the \nsame language in a new statute indicates, as a \ngeneral matter, the intent to incorporate its \nadministrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201d \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). Thus, \nCongress did not intend for each petitioner to have to \nestablish venue individually under the TCA. Instead, \nif venue is proper for any one of the petitioners, then \nthe TCA\u2019s venue requirement is satisfied.   \n \n15 DOJ\u2019s Manual appears to have a typo\u2014the correct \nreference is \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393(e)(4),\u201d not (e)(3). Nonetheless, the \nstatute was amended in 2011 (after the manual was published), \nat which point \u00a7 1391(e)(4) became \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). The relevant \nlanguage remains the same. Federal Courts Jurisdiction and \nVenue Clarification Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-63, 125 Stat. \n758 (eff. Dec. 7, 2011).  \n\n \n21 \n \n \nThis longstanding and uniform interpretation, \nmoreover, \nmakes \nsense. \nOtherwise, \ndifferent \npetitioners would have to file separate lawsuits in \ndifferent courts challenging the same agency action. \nIndeed, in some situations, there could be a petition \nin every regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit. While \nthose petitions would be assigned to one circuit \neventually, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), there is no \nreason to force litigants and the court system to \nengage in this meaningless kabuki dance. When \nparties coordinate and file a single petition, it saves \neveryone time and resources (including FDA, which \nwill only have to respond to one petition). See Exxon \nCorp. v. FTC, 588 F.2d 895, 898\u201399 (3d Cir. 1978) \n(\u201c[R]equiring every plaintiff in an action against the \nfederal \ngovernment \nor \nan \nagent \nthereof \nto \nindependently meet section 1391(e)\u2019s standards \nwould result in an unnecessary multiplicity of \nlitigation. The language of the statute itself \nmandates no such narrow construction. There is no \nrequirement that all plaintiffs reside in the forum \ndistrict.\u201d), overruled on other grounds, Reifer v. \nWestport Ins. Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014); see \nalso Sidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 (collecting cases); \nQuarles v. Gen\u2019l Inv. & Dev. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n12 (D.D.C. 2003) (citing Exxon and finding that \nsection \n1391 \ncontains \n\u201ca \nfar \nless \nrestrictive \nrequirement\u201d than other venue statutes given the \nproblems inherent in suing government entities); Ry. \nLabor Execs.\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, \n958 F.2d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing Exxon with \napproval as to avoiding \u201cmultiplicity of similar suits \nin different courts\u201d).   \n\n \n22 \n \n \nLikewise, the longstanding interpretation makes \nsense when one considers the statutorily enumerated \nscope of relief when a denial order is challenged. The \nstatute expressly contemplates that an improper \ndenial order will be \u201cset[ ] aside.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(c). \nSo even if the manufacturer and retailer were to file \nseparate petitions to have a denial order set aside, \nthe end result (if either prevails) would be the same. \nAs such, there is no sensible reason to force the \nmanufacturer and retailer to sue in different forums. \nConversely, FDA\u2019s interpretation does not make \nsense because it would not even solve the problem \nthat FDA purports to identify. A retailer, for \nexample, could challenge a denial order for a product \nthat it sells in its home circuit within ten days of the \ndenial order. Then, after those ten days but before \nexpiration of the thirty-day statute of limitations, a \nmanufacturer could challenge the same denial order \nin its home circuit. The result: both petitions would \nbe consolidated in the court in which the retailer \nfiled, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, thus (i) landing the case \nwhere FDA (erroneously) claims it does not belong, \nand (ii) multiplying the work of the appellate courts. \nBecause nothing in the Act requires each \npetitioner \nchallenging \na \ndenial \norder \nto \nindependently establish venue, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision was correct. See Alto C.A. Amended Order \n(Feb. 2, 2024).  \nc. \nAttempting to support its (forfeited) venue-as-\nto-each-petitioner argument, FDA relies on two, \ncentury-old cases interpreting irrelevant statutes. \nSee Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890); Camp v. \nGress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). Neither case helps FDA.  \n\n \n23 \n \n \nIn both cases, the statute provided, \u201c[W]here the \njurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the \naction is between citizens of different states, suit \nshall be brought only in the district of the residence \nof either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d Smith, 133 \nU.S. at 317; Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. In Smith, two \nplaintiffs, one from Arkansas and one from Missouri, \nsued a Texan. The Court held that venue under the \ndiversity-jurisdiction provision was lacking because \nthe two plaintiffs were not from the same state. See \nid. (holding that the statute \u201cmakes no provision in \nterms for the case of two defendants or two plaintiffs \nwho are citizens of different states\u201d). In so holding, \nthe Smith Court looked to Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \nopinion in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, which established \nthe \ncomplete \ndiversity \nrule\u2014for \ndiversity \njurisdiction, no plaintiff can be from the same state \nas any defendant. 3 Cranch 267 (1806). Whatever the \nwisdom of that rule and Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \ninterpretation of the venue provision,16 the Court \nconsistently applied it when interpreting that venue \nstatute governing diversity jurisdiction; because \nCongress (in 1890) had not legislatively changed the \nrelevant language interpreted by Strawbridge, the \nSmith Court reasoned that Congress accepted the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation. Forty years later, Camp \nfollowed Smith and applied the same rule for \ndefendants in diversity cases\u2014they all had to be \nfrom the same state. Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. \n \n16 Strawbridge was doubted by even the Great Chief \nJustice himself. See Louisville C. & C.R Co. v. Letson, 43 U.S. \n497, 555\u201356 (1844) (Wayne, J.) (\u201c[b]y no one was the correctness \nof [Strawbridge and its progeny] more questioned than by the \nlate chief justice who gave them\u201d). \n\n \n24 \n \n \nSmith and Camp are plainly irrelevant here.   \nFirst, Smith and Camp dealt with a restrictive \nprovision that is no longer on the books. See Smith, \n133 U.S. at 319 (noting that \u201cthe purpose of the \nlegislature [was] to restrict rather than to enlarge \nthe jurisdiction of the circuit courts\u201d). Indeed, \u201cmuch \nhas changed since the Court\u2019s ruling in Smith.\u201d \nSidney Coal Co. v. Massanari, 221 F. Supp. 2d 755, \n764 (E.D. Ky. 2002). \n\u201c[W]hen Smith was decided, \u2026 the venue statute \nin effect today did not exist.\u201d Zumft v. Doney Slate \nCo., 698 F. Supp. 444, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \u201cIn 1966, \nto cure the problem created where the residences of \nco-plaintiffs or co-defendants made the proper laying \nof venue impossible, a venue statute providing for \ncommencement of an action in the district where the \nclaim arose was passed.\u201d Id. (citing Brunette Machine \nWorks, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, \n710 n.8 (1972)). Under that new statute, \u201cdismissal is \nnot necessarily required where venue cannot be \npremised on the parties\u2019 citizenship.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, diversity cases can now be heard where the \nclaim arose\u2014thus negating the need to look at \nparties\u2019 \nresidences \naltogether \nin \nsome \ncases. \nMoreover, \u201cthe statute at issue in Smith was \nsuperceded in 1966 by Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406, which provided district courts some \nflexibility when making a venue determination.\u201d \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 n.12. Specifically, \n\u00a7 1406 \u201cgives district courts discretion to either \ndismiss an improperly venued case or \u2018if it be in the \ninterest of justice\u2019 to transfer such case to any \ndistrict or division in which the case could have been \ncommenced.\u201d Zumft, 698 F. Supp. at 446. In other \n\n \n25 \n \n \nwords, even when it comes to diversity cases now, \nSmith \nhas \nlimited \napplication \ngiven \nthese \nintervening legislative changes.17  \nSecond, and more importantly, Smith and Camp \ndealt with venue in diversity cases\u2014not cases \nagainst the federal government. When it came to \nsuits against federal officials, there is a long and \nunbroken history establishing that today only one \nplaintiff needs to establish venue. Before 1962, \u201cthe \nlaw on the proper place of suit for actions against \nfederal \nofficers \nand \nagencies \nwas \nquite \nunsatisfactory.\u201d Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. \nEssentially, most plaintiffs had to sue in the District \nof Columbia. Id. To cure this \u201cevil\u201d as some put it, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. TVA, 459 \nF.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1972), Congress added 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which was intended \u201cto broaden the \nvenue of civil actions which could previously have \nbeen brought only in the District of Columbia.\u201d \nSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 489 (1971); \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 344\u201345 & n.12; see Wright \n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. In particular, the new \nstatute allowed the plaintiff to sue where \u201cthe \nplaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). As court after \ncourt concluded, \u201cinterpreting the phrase \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019 to mean \u2018all plaintiffs\u2019 or \u2018each plaintiff\u2019 \n \n17 Even before Smith, this Court recognized that \u201c[i]t is \nnot denied that under the constitutional provision as to the \njudicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, \nhave given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases \nbetween citizens of one or more states on one side, and citizens \nof one or more other states on the other side.\u201d Louisville, C. & \nC.R. Co., 43 U.S. at 500\u201301.  \n\n \n26 \n \n \nwould substantially limit the statute\u2019s breadth and \nundermine congressional intent.\u201d Sidney Coal, 427 \nF.3d at 344 (collecting cases). \u201cEach court faced with \nthe same issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d Id. at 344\u2013\n45. \u201cThus, Smith has no bearing on this Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of\u201d venue provisions governing actions \nagainst the federal government. Id. at 345 n.12. \nThird, the statutory language at issue in Smith \nand Camp is different from the TCA\u2019s venue \nprovision. The provision in Smith and Camp said, \n\u201csuit shall be brought only in the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added). But there \nis no similarly restrictive language in the TCA\u2019s \nvenue provision. It allows \u201cany adversely affected \nperson\u201d to sue in the circuit \u201cin which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Thus, Smith and Camp have no \napplication here.  \nFDA also looks for support in secondary sources to \nargue that \u201c[the Supreme] Court long ago held that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.\u201d Pet. 13 \n(quoting 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. 2023)). But if \nthe Agency read on, it would find that Wright & \nMiller addresses this situation\u2014civil actions against \nfederal agencies\u2014and explains, as detailed above, \nthat \u201c[i]n cases involving multiple plaintiffs, venue is \nproper where any one of them resides.\u201d Wright & \nMiller, supra, at \u00a7 3815 (emphasis added). In short, \nFDA is without support for its position.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \n* * * \nThis Court has long observed that it is the \n\u201c\u2018plaintiff\u2019s venue privilege,\u2019\u201d not the defendant\u2019s\u2014\nand certainly not the federal government\u2019s, with its \nnational omnipresence. Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Ct. W. Dist. Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) \n(quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 635 \n(1964)). Nothing about the TCA\u2019s venue provision \ndisplaces that settled privilege. It neither prohibits \nretailers from seeking relief in their home circuits to \nvindicate their own interests independent of a \nmanufacturer nor prohibits a manufacturer from \njoining retailers in their properly filed petitions.  \nRespondent Avail was formed and has its principal \nplace of business in Texas, and Respondent \nMississippi Association is incorporated and has its \nprincipal place of business in Mississippi. FDA does \nnot dispute those facts. Thus, the Fifth Circuit was \ncorrect to hold that venue is proper in that circuit. \nSee 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nII. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT AND THE \nALLEGED \n\u201cEFFECTS\u201d \nARE \nINCREASINGLY \nRARE. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not only correct, but \nthere is also no circuit conflict over either of the \nissues presented by this case. Pet. 17. Moreover, the \n\u201ceffects\u201d that FDA laments are overblown because \nthe Agency can only identify three petitions out of \ndozens in the almost year and a half since the Vibe \ndecision that it contends \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u2013\n17; see generally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing \nOrders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \n\n \n28 \n \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024). \n1.  FDA admits that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \ndoes not create a circuit conflict about the meaning of \nthe TCA\u2019s venue provision.\u201d Id. The Fifth Circuit is \nthe first and only circuit court to have analyzed \nwhether a retailer has statutory standing to invoke \nthe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision and, as explained \nabove, its analysis falls squarely within this Court\u2019s \nestablished precedent. See supra pp. 7\u20139. Indeed, as \nexplained, it accords with the uniform decisions of \nthe federal courts in related contexts. See supra pp. \n16\u201320. \nNevertheless, FDA attempts to manufacture a \n\u201cconflict\u201d as to its (forfeited) alternative argument \nthat \neach \npetitioner \nmust \nestablish \nvenue \nindependently. Pet. 14. In so doing, FDA invokes a \nsingle case, Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal \nPower Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), \nwhich was decided forty-five years before the TCA \nwas even enacted. FDA claims that Amerada \nPetroleum held that \u201cout-of-circuit companies could \nnot join a local company to seek review in that \ncircuit.\u201d Pet. 14. That is wrong. In Amerada \nPetroleum, the Court was faced with \u201cseparate \napplications [to the federal agency] of natural-gas \ncompanies,\u201d only one of which was located in the \nTenth Circuit. Id. at 810 (emphasis added). Because \nthe statute clearly contemplated a separate \u201corder \nrelating to [each] particular natural-gas company,\u201d \neach company needed to bring its own suit over each \norder, and thus independently satisfy venue. See id. \nHere, by contrast, all Respondents are \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by FDA\u2019s single order on one application. 21 \n\n \n29 \n \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1); see supra pp. 9\u201314. And so the \ngeneral rule that only one plaintiff needs to have \nvenue applies. See supra pp. 16\u201320. \n2.  The purported \u201ceffects\u201d of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision are also no reason for this Court to step in. \nPet. 16.  \nFor all of FDA\u2019s hand-wringing about \u201c[o]ther out-\nof-circuit manufacturers \u2026 using the same tactic to \nobtain judicial review of FDA orders in the Fifth \nCircuit,\u201d one would expect many more petitions like \nthis one. Id. It has been almost a year and a half \nsince the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit,\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at 188, and FDA can only \nidentify three petitions out of dozens filed since then \nthat it claims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 17; see \ngenerally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing Orders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024).18  \nMoreover, while FDA has issued hundreds of \nthousands of denial orders, see Vibe, 65 F.4th at 192 \n(\u201c[FDA] has denied over 355,000 such applications.\u201d), \nFDA had made \u201cdeterminations on more than 99% \n \n18 FDA identifies three petitions for judicial review it \nclaims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u201317. There now appear to be \nthree more petitions for judicial review in the Fifth Circuit with \na retailer establishing venue. See NicQuid LLC v. FDA, No. 24-\n60272 (5th Cir. Jun. 3, 2024); Breeze Smoke, LLC v. FDA, No. \n24-60304 (5th Cir. Jun. 12, 2024); Vertigo Vapor v. FDA, No. 24-\n60332 (5th Cir. Jun. 28, 2024). At best then, FDA can point to \nonly six petitions for judicial review (other than the Vuse \npetitions) out of hundreds of thousands of denial orders.  \n\n \n30 \n \n \nof\u201d applications filed by the time Vibe was decided.19 \nAnd, under the statute, petitions must be filed thirty \ndays after a denial order. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a). \nThus, \nthere \nwill \nnot\u2014indeed, \ncannot\u2014be \nan \nonslaught of petitions filed in the Fifth Circuit. \nWhile it is true that new tobacco products must seek \nauthorization, FDA\u2019s onerous requirements for \nmarketing authorization have made it such that few \nmanufacturers can even attempt to comply. Put \nanother way, fewer applications will mean fewer \npetitions for judicial review. \nEqually misplaced are FDA\u2019s claims about the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201ccontribut[ing] to a \u2018youth \nvaping epidemic.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023)). As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision simply relates to which \ncourt may decide the case; it does not dictate the \ncorrect substantive result in any case, let alone \ncontribute to an epidemic. Moreover, youth use has \ndropped by more than 25% since 2022.20 And Vuse, \nwhile the leading e\u2011cigarette among adults, is not \npopular among youth, ranking behind brands like Elf \nBar (three times more popular among youth than \nVuse) and Esco Bars, and continues to decline.21 \n \n19 FDA, FDA Makes Determinations On More Than 99% \nof the 26 Million Tobacco Products For Which Applications Were \nSubmitted (Mar. 15, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/yxcf2dfm. \n20 FDA, National Survey Shows Drop in E-Cigarette Use \nAmong \nHigh \nSchool \nStudents \n(Nov. \n2, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3nn4tvar. \n21 See Jan Birdsey, et al., Tobacco Product Use Among \nU.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014National Youth \nTobacco Survey, 2023, 72 MMWR 1173 (Nov. 2023). \n\n \n31 \n \n \nIndeed, only 1.5% of middle and high school students \nreported using any Vuse product last year.22 FDA \ncannot credibly claim that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nis contributing to any supposed youth vaping \nepidemic. \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE. \nEven if the question presented were otherwise \nworthy of this Court\u2019s attention, this petition would \nbe an exceedingly poor vehicle for answering it. First, \nthe specific interlocutory posture of this case is \nhighly irregular, requiring this Court to become the \nfirst appellate court to review a procedural order \n(because the case was originally filed in the court of \nappeals) and the first court to review the second \n(forfeited) question. Second, even if FDA were to \nprevail on the venue issue in this Court, the case \nwould not be over.  \n1.  The interlocutory posture of this case makes \nthe petition highly irregular. The general rule is that \na district court\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer on venue grounds is not immediately \nappealable. See, e.g., Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, \n490 U.S. 495, 498 (1989) (venue); Van Cauwenberghe \nv. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 519 (1988) (forum non \nconveniens). And while a different statute governs \ncertiorari before judgment in cases pending at the \ncourt of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the government \ncites no on-point case in which this Court has ever \ngranted review of an interlocutory venue decision in \nthis procedural posture. \n \n22 Birdsey, et al., supra. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nInstead, the government points to four other cases \nthat it says support review of the interlocutory \ndecision \nbelow. \nBut \neach \nof \nthese \ncases \nis \ndistinguishable.  \nTC Heartland, Walden, and Atlantic Marine all \ninvolved cases where the court of appeals had \nentered a final order or judgment for purposes of the \nappeal before it. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods \nGrp. Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 263 (2017) \n(mandamus); Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 291 \n(2014) (judgment); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54 \n(mandamus). This case is a far cry from those, as the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision below merely entered an \ninterlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in a case filed in the court of appeals in the \nfirst instance.  \nThe closest the government comes is Mercantile \nNational Bank v. Langdeau. But that case analyzed \na prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, which lays out a \nseparate standard for certiorari review of final \njudgments from state courts. The Court held in that \nparticular case that \u00a7 1257 was satisfied because a \nstate supreme court had issued a final order on \nvenue, the only federal issue in the case\u2014and \npetitioner had made a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d that a \n\u201cfederal statute\u201d \u201cprohibit[ed] further proceedings \nagainst the defendants in the state court in which \nthe suit is now pending.\u201d 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963). In \nother words, the venue decision meant that the only \nfederal question had been addressed and it was thus \nsufficiently final for purposes of federal review. Here, \nhowever, this case remains pending in the Fifth \nCircuit and has not proceeded to final judgment. Pet. \n19 (conceding that \u201cno final judgment on the merits \n\n \n33 \n \n \nhas been entered\u201d). Unlike in Mercantile, there are a \nlitany of other federal issues that will be pressed and \npassed upon before final judgment, meaning that \nthis cannot be characterized as a final federal \njudgment. Cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 501 \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s interlocutory appeal to \nenforce a forum-selection clause \u201cdoes not fall \nwithin \u2026 the collateral order doctrine\u201d). \nAs to the second question, FDA\u2019s petition is even \nmore irregular. As noted above, FDA has forfeited \nthis issue; the Agency never presented its argument \nbefore the Fifth Circuit. See supra p. 16; Sachs, 577 \nU.S. at 37. Because the Fifth Circuit did not have the \nchance to pass upon the question, this Court would \neffectively be stepping in as the court of first review. \nFDA cites no case where this Court has granted \nreview under such circumstances. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not finally \nresolve this case. As even FDA concedes, the Fifth \nCircuit has not decided the merits or rendered final \njudgment. According to Rule 11, then, review is \npresumptively inappropriate. See Sup. Ct. R. 11. Yet \nthe \ngovernment \ndoes \nnot \nexplain \nwhy \nthe \ninterlocutory order addressing venue \u201cis of such \nimperative \npublic \nimportance \nas \nto \nrequire \nimmediate determination in this Court.\u201d Id. (citing \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(e)). That is particularly notable \nbecause \nFDA \nhas \nalready \nresolved \n99% \nof \napplications filed by September 9, 2020, and the time \nto challenge such denials has long since run. See \nsupra at p. 26. The universe of cases in which this \nissue can now arise is therefore tiny, and if it is as \nimportant as FDA claims, can be resolved after final \njudgment. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nIn addition, even if this Court concluded that \nretailers lack statutory standing, FDA would not be \nentitled to the result it seeks\u2014transfer or dismissal. \nVenue is not lost even if the party whose presence \nwas necessary for venue is dismissed from the case. \nSee, e.g., Exxon, 588 F.2d at 899; Horihan v. Hartford \nIns. Co., 979 F. Supp. 1073, 1076 (E.D. Tex. 1997). \nThe exception is where a party\u2019s claims are frivolous \nor joinder is fraudulent. See Wright & Miller, supra, \nat \u00a7 3815 n.40 (collecting cases). FDA does not \ncontend either here. Cf. B, Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., \n663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1981); Honey Holdings I, \nLtd. v. Alfred L. Wolff, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 3d 543, 558 \nn.16 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Nor could it, especially since \nthe Fifth Circuit has upheld retailers\u2019 rights to assert \nthe claims at issue.  \nFurther, if FDA were to prevail on its alternative \nargument (that each party must establish venue), \nthe case would still continue.23 At best for FDA, \nRJRV and RJR Vapor Co. would be dismissed from \nthe case. But that would not affect the retailers\u2019 case. \nAnd if the retailers are successful, the denial order \nwill \nbe \nvacated, \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthe \nmanufacturers are parties.  \nIn short, even if FDA were to prevail in this Court, \nthe case would neither be dismissed nor transferred.  \n \n23 This Court has granted review in FDA v. Wages & \nWhite Lion, No. 23-1038, which raises many of the same merits \nissues as Respondents\u2019 case. But granting Wages does not \nchange anything about FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari in this case, \nwhich should plainly be denied for the reasons state above. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n \nJuly 3, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nNOEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, an internal thought process regarding information-gathering strategy, provides no new external facts, legal arguments, or signals about the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are preserved from the previous update. The observation confirms that the most significant piece of missing evidence is the Respondents' own merits brief, the search for which prompted this internal reasoning.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the case's legal landscape, which is unchanged by this observation, is as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable):** My model of the government's case is complete and stable, based on their merits brief. The FDA advocates for a narrow, purpose-driven interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA), arguing that:\n    1.  **Zone of Interests:** The judicial review provision (\u00a7 387l) is contextually limited by the application process (\u00a7 387j), meaning only the applicant-manufacturer is within the statute's zone of interests.\n    2.  **Implicit Preclusion:** The specific review pathway for applicants implicitly precludes review for all other parties.\n    3.  **Independent Venue:** Each petitioner must independently satisfy venue requirements.\n    4.  **Forum Shopping:** Allowing retailers to sue facilitates improper, strategic forum shopping.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Significantly Strengthened and Broadened):** My understanding of the Respondents' position was substantially deepened by the Atlantic Legal Foundation (ALF) amicus brief. It is now a multi-faceted argument combining textualism with a broader administrative law principle.\n    1.  **Expansive Textualism (Reinforced):** The plain meaning of \"any person adversely affected\" (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1)) is the central pillar. This is supported by precedent like *Bennett v. Spear*, which described similar language as an \"authorization of remarkable breadth,\" and the principle from *Lexmark* that the \"benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff\" under similar APA language.\n    2.  **Direct Harm (Clarified):** The harm to retailers is not merely indirect economic loss. A marketing denial order renders their products \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated,\" creating direct and immediate legal jeopardy, including criminal liability, civil fines, and product seizure (per 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331, 333, 334).\n    3.  **Neutralizing the \"Forum Shopping\" Narrative (New Insight):** The FDA's own efforts to avoid review in the Fifth Circuit can be framed as a form of \"reverse forum shopping,\" neutralizing the government's pejorative label and refocusing the Court on the plain statutory text that grants retailers the right to sue where they reside.\n    4.  **Procedural Defenses (Stable):** The arguments that the FDA forfeited its challenge and that the case is a \"poor vehicle\" for deciding this question remain part of the Respondents' likely defense.\n\n*   **New Dimension: Systemic Implications for Administrative Law (Major Update from Prior Observation):** The most impactful argument, introduced by the ALF brief, is that the phrase \"any person adversely affected\" appears in dozens of federal statutes. A narrow ruling for the FDA could have a significant chilling effect on judicial review across the administrative state. This elevates the case from a niche TCA dispute to a major administrative law question, likely to appeal to Justices concerned with checking agency power and ensuring broad access to courts.\n\nIn summary, my beliefs are stable. The central conflict remains a clash between the FDA's narrow, structuralist interpretation and a broad, textualist argument with far-reaching administrative law implications. My confidence in the strength of the Respondents' legal position is high, but this is based on an amicus brief. The Respondents' own merits brief is the critical missing piece of evidence needed to confirm whether they adopt this powerful systemic argument and to fully assess the final shape of their case before the Court.",

This observation substantially confirms, refines, and strengthens my model of the Respondents' case, which was previously based on an amicus brief, and introduces powerful new procedural arguments.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the case is now as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (FDA) Position (Stable):** My model of the government's arguments remains unchanged. The FDA continues to advocate for a narrow, purpose-driven interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA), arguing that only the applicant-manufacturer is within the \"zone of interests\" for judicial review, that this specific review pathway implicitly precludes others, and that allowing retailers to sue encourages improper forum shopping. The BIO directly confronts these arguments, but my understanding of the FDA's position itself is stable.\n\n*   **Respondents' (R.J. Reynolds et al.) Position (Confirmed, Refined, and Strengthened):** The BIO confirms that the Respondents' case is built on a foundation of textualism and broad principles of judicial review, while also adding significant procedural defenses.\n    1.  **Textualism as the Core Argument (Confirmed and Detailed):** The BIO confirms that the plain meaning of \"any person adversely affected\" is the central pillar of the defense. It methodically breaks down the phrase, citing *United States v. Gonzales* for the \"expansive meaning\" of \"any\" and dictionary definitions for \"adversely\" and \"affected.\" This is a classic textualist approach aimed directly at the current Court's interpretive methods.\n    2.  **Nature of Harm is Direct Legal Jeopardy (Clarified and Strengthened):** The BIO powerfully refutes the idea that retailers suffer only indirect economic harm. It argues that an FDA marketing denial order (MDO) directly causes the retailers' products to become \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated\" under the TCA. This exposes retailers to immediate and severe legal consequences, including civil penalties, criminal liability, and seizure of goods (per 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331, 333, 334). This framing transforms the retailers from mere bystanders into directly regulated entities harmed by the agency's action.\n    3.  **Statutory Standing is Permissive (Confirmed):** The BIO embraces the precedents I had previously identified (*Bennett v. Spear*, *Lexmark*), arguing that the \"zone of interests\" test is permissive. It adds citations to *Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak* to reinforce that broad judicial review provisions should be read broadly.\n    4.  **New Procedural Defenses (Major New Insight):** The BIO introduces strong arguments for why the Court should deny certiorari on procedural grounds, regardless of the merits. This is a significant addition to my model.\n        *   **Improper Interlocutory Appeal:** The FDA is asking the Court to review a non-final, interlocutory venue order, which is a highly unusual procedural posture.\n        *   **Forfeiture:** The Respondents argue the FDA *forfeited* its second question (whether each petitioner must independently establish venue) by failing to raise it in the lower court.\n        *   **No Circuit Split:** The BIO emphasizes the FDA's own admission that there is no disagreement among the circuit courts on this issue, a key factor the Supreme Court considers when granting review.\n\n*   **Systemic Administrative Law Implications (Refined Understanding):** My prior belief, based on the ALF amicus brief, was that the systemic impact on other statutes using the phrase \"any person adversely affected\" would be a centerpiece of the Respondents' argument. The BIO takes a more nuanced approach. While it lists other statutes with similar language in its table of authorities, the core of its written argument focuses narrowly on the TCA's text and the specific facts of this case. This is likely a strategic choice for a Brief in Opposition: the goal is to persuade the Court that the case is simple, correctly decided, and does not warrant review, rather than framing it as a momentous administrative law question that *demands* the Court's attention. The systemic implications are now a background theme rather than a primary argument.\n\nIn summary, my beliefs have been significantly updated. I have moved from relying on an amicus brief to having the Respondents' own core arguments. The central legal conflict remains a clash between the FDA's narrow, structuralist reading and the Respondents' broad, textualist one. However, the conflict is now overlaid with powerful procedural arguments that provide the Court with multiple \"off-ramps\" to deny the petition without ever reaching the merits. My confidence in the strength of the Respondents' legal position is substantially increased, and I now see significant procedural hurdles for the FDA to even get a hearing on the merits.",

The Supreme Court's grant of certiorari, despite the lack of a circuit split, is a powerful signal that the FDA's arguments are viewed as highly meritorious.

The single most important piece of missing evidence is the Petitioner's full-throated case on the merits.\n\nTask EIG is 1.0 (maximal) because this action directly targets the largest source of uncertainty. Reading the Petitioner's merits brief will move my understanding of their position from a low-resolution inference to a high-resolution model, allowing for a much more accurate assessment of the legal clash and the likely majority view. No other single action could provide a greater reduction in uncertainty about the case outcome at this stage.\n\nDesign EIG is 0.8 because this action provides a powerful lesson in SCOTUS prediction strategy. It reinforces the general principle that a cert grant is a major predictive signal, and that the agent's focus must immediately shift from cert-stage documents (like the BIO) to the merits briefs.

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \nOPINION BELOW \nThe order of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-8a) is \nunreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 2, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 1a-15a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \n\n2 \n \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA), to regulate tobacco products.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 393(d)(2).  The Act applies automatically to some \ntobacco products, such as cigarettes, but other products \nbecome subject to it only once FDA issues a rule that \n\u201cdeems\u201d the product \u201cto be subject to\u201d the Act.  21 \nU.S.C. 387a(b). \nAs relevant here, the Act restricts the marketing of \n\u201cnew tobacco product[s]\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products that \nwere not commercially marketed in the United States \nas of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A manu-\nfacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into in-\nterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization from \nFDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2).   \nA manufacturer seeking marketing authorization \nmust file an application with FDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(b).  \nAfter reviewing the application, FDA must issue either \nan \u201corder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \nan \u201corder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d \ninto interstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  The \nagency must deny an application unless the applicant \nshows that the product would be \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).   \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the denial in accordance with the Administrative \n\n3 \n \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \n2. This case involves the application of the Act to \nelectronic nicotine delivery systems, which are com-\nmonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes.  See Office of the \nSurgeon General, U.S. Public Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs., E-Cigarette Use Among \nYouth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon Gen-\neral 3 (2016).  An e-cigarette is a battery-powered device \nthat heats a nicotine solution, or \u201ce-liquid,\u201d converting \nthe solution into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user then inhales.  See id. at 11.   \nBecause Congress did not list e-cigarettes among the \nproducts to which the Act automatically applied, they \nwere not at first subject to regulation under the Act.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387a(b).  But in 2016, FDA issued a rule \ndeeming e-cigarettes and e-liquids to be subject to the \nAct.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, \n2016).  Because e-cigarettes had generally not been on \nthe market as of February 15, 2007, they are new to-\nbacco products under the Act, and FDA\u2019s deeming rule \nmeant that they could lawfully be marketed only after \nreceiving agency authorization.  See Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, \n144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \nIn 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy regard-\ning certain e-cigarettes.  See Center for Tobacco Prods., \nFDA, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., Enforce-\nment Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Sys-\ntems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Mar-\nket Without Premarket Authorization (Revised) (Apr. \n2020).  FDA stated that it intended to prioritize enforce-\nment action against certain categories of products: cer-\ntain flavored products, products for which the manufac-\n\n4 \n \nturer failed to take adequate measures to prevent mi-\nnors\u2019 access, products targeted to minors, and products \nfor which the manufacturer failed to submit an applica-\ntion by September 9, 2020.  See id. at 3.  For other e-\ncigarettes, FDA stated that it would \u201cexercise enforce-\nment discretion for up to one year pending FDA review, \nunless there is a negative action by FDA on such appli-\ncation.\u201d  Id. at 27.  FDA warned, however, that its guid-\nance \u201cdoes not in any way alter the fact that it is illegal \nto market any new tobacco product without premarket \nauthorization.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products.  See Pet. App. 13a.  \nReynolds is incorporated, and thus resides, in North \nCarolina, and it maintains its principal place of business \nin Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds \nVapor Co., Business Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. \n2022, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023). \nReynolds applied for authorization to market berry- \nand menthol-flavored e-cigarette products under the \nbrand name Vuse Alto.  See Pet. App. 3a.  FDA denied \nthe applications, finding that Reynolds had failed to \nshow that the products would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.  See id. at 9a-23a.   \n2. Reynolds sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n3a.  Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a petition \nfor review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See id. at 7a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting).  But those courts had already rejected the \nprincipal legal theory on which Reynolds relies here.  \nSee ibid.  Specifically, Reynolds claims that FDA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously by changing the evidentiary \nstandards for flavored e-cigarette products after manu-\n\n5 \n \nfacturers had submitted their applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The Fourth and D.C. Circuits previously re-\njected similar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 \n(4th Cir.); Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022). \nReynolds sought judicial review in the Fifth Circuit \ninstead.  See Pet. App. 3a.  A panel of that court had \nrejected a claim similar to that brought by Reynolds, \nsee Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, \n41 F.4th 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2022), but by the time Reyn-\nolds filed its petition for review, the court had vacated \nthat decision and granted rehearing en banc, see Wages \n& White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  The en banc court would eventually rule \nin favor of the e-cigarette manufacturers.  See Wages & \nWhite Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FD\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, re-\nquires a person to obtain authorization from the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) before introducing a \nnew tobacco product into interstate commerce.  If FDA \ndenies an application for authorization, \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected by such  * * *  denial may file a petition \nfor judicial review of such  * * *  denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The \nquestion presented is:  \nWhether a manufacturer may file a petition for re-\nview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it \nneither resides nor has its principal place of business, if \nthe petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts that is located within that circuit. \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 1 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 4 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 7 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nA retailer may not file a petition for review of an \nFDA order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nfor marketing authorization ......................................... 11 \n1.

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \nOPINION BELOW \nThe order of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-8a) is \nunreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 2, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 1a-15a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \n\n2 \n \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA), to regulate tobacco products.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 393(d)(2).  The Act applies automatically to some \ntobacco products, such as cigarettes, but other products \nbecome subject to it only once FDA issues a rule that \n\u201cdeems\u201d the product \u201cto be subject to\u201d the Act.  21 \nU.S.C. 387a(b). \nAs relevant here, the Act restricts the marketing of \n\u201cnew tobacco product[s]\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products that \nwere not commercially marketed in the United States \nas of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A manu-\nfacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into in-\nterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization from \nFDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2).   \nA manufacturer seeking marketing authorization \nmust file an application with FDA.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(b).  \nAfter reviewing the application, FDA must issue either \nan \u201corder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \nan \u201corder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d \ninto interstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  The \nagency must deny an application unless the applicant \nshows that the product would be \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).   \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the denial in accordance with the Administrative \n\n3 \n \nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \n2. This case involves the application of the Act to \nelectronic nicotine delivery systems, which are com-\nmonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes.  See Office of the \nSurgeon General, U.S. Public Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Health & Human Servs., E-Cigarette Use Among \nYouth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon Gen-\neral 3 (2016).  An e-cigarette is a battery-powered device \nthat heats a nicotine solution, or \u201ce-liquid,\u201d converting \nthe solution into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user then inhales.  See id. at 11.   \nBecause Congress did not list e-cigarettes among the \nproducts to which the Act automatically applied, they \nwere not at first subject to regulation under the Act.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387a(b).  But in 2016, FDA issued a rule \ndeeming e-cigarettes and e-liquids to be subject to the \nAct.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, \n2016).  Because e-cigarettes had generally not been on \nthe market as of February 15, 2007, they are new to-\nbacco products under the Act, and FDA\u2019s deeming rule \nmeant that they could lawfully be marketed only after \nreceiving agency authorization.  See Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, \n144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \nIn 2020, FDA issued an enforcement policy regard-\ning certain e-cigarettes.  See Center for Tobacco Prods., \nFDA, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., Enforce-\nment Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Sys-\ntems (ENDS) and Other Deemed Products on the Mar-\nket Without Premarket Authorization (Revised) (Apr. \n2020).  FDA stated that it intended to prioritize enforce-\nment action against certain categories of products: cer-\ntain flavored products, products for which the manufac-\n\n4 \n \nturer failed to take adequate measures to prevent mi-\nnors\u2019 access, products targeted to minors, and products \nfor which the manufacturer failed to submit an applica-\ntion by September 9, 2020.  See id. at 3.  For other e-\ncigarettes, FDA stated that it would \u201cexercise enforce-\nment discretion for up to one year pending FDA review, \nunless there is a negative action by FDA on such appli-\ncation.\u201d  Id. at 27.  FDA warned, however, that its guid-\nance \u201cdoes not in any way alter the fact that it is illegal \nto market any new tobacco product without premarket \nauthorization.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products.  See Pet. App. 13a.  \nReynolds is incorporated, and thus resides, in North \nCarolina, and it maintains its principal place of business \nin Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds \nVapor Co., Business Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. \n2022, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023). \nReynolds applied for authorization to market berry- \nand menthol-flavored e-cigarette products under the \nbrand name Vuse Alto.  See Pet. App. 3a.  FDA denied \nthe applications, finding that Reynolds had failed to \nshow that the products would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.  See id. at 9a-23a.   \n2. Reynolds sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n3a.  Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a petition \nfor review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See id. at 7a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting).  But those courts had already rejected the \nprincipal legal theory on which Reynolds relies here.  \nSee ibid.  Specifically, Reynolds claims that FDA acted \narbitrarily and capriciously by changing the evidentiary \nstandards for flavored e-cigarette products after manu-\n\n5 \n \nfacturers had submitted their applications.  See R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 189 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The Fourth and D.C. Circuits previously re-\njected similar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 \n(4th Cir.); Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022). \nReynolds sought judicial review in the Fifth Circuit \ninstead.  See Pet. App. 3a.  A panel of that court had \nrejected a claim similar to that brought by Reynolds, \nsee Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, \n41 F.4th 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2022), but by the time Reyn-\nolds filed its petition for review, the court had vacated \nthat decision and granted rehearing en banc, see Wages \n& White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  The en banc court would eventually rule \nin favor of the e-cigarette manufacturers.  See Wages & \nWhite Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n386 (5th Cir. 2024), cert. granted, No. 23-1038 (oral ar-\ngument scheduled for Dec. 2, 2024). \nThree other entities joined Reynolds\u2019 Fifth Circuit \npetition: RJR Vapor Co., LLC; Avail Vapor Texas, \nLLC; and the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and \nConvenience Stores Association.  See C.A. Pet. for Re-\nview 1-4 (Oct. 12, 2023).  The first entity (a corporate af-\nfiliate of Reynolds) is based in North Carolina and sells \nVuse Alto products online.  See Pet. 5.  The second en-\ntity is a Texas company that runs a retail store that sells \nVuse Alto products.  See C.A. Pet. for Review 3.  The \nthird entity is a Mississippi trade association of gas sta-\ntions and convenience stores, which has members that \nsell Vuse Alto products.  See ibid.   \nReynolds and the other three entities (respondents \nin this Court) alleged that Avail and the Association\u2019s \nmembers \u201cwill no longer be able to sell\u201d Vuse products \n\n6 \n \nand \u201cwill have to dispose of [their] existing inventory\u201d \nnow that FDA has denied Reynolds\u2019 application.  C.A. \nPet. for Review 3.  Respondents argued that venue lies \nin the Fifth Circuit because Avail and the Association \nare both based there.  See ibid.  \u201cOut of an abundance \nof caution,\u201d however, respondents later filed a \u201cprotec-\ntive petition\u201d in the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. for Review at 3, \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-1298 (Oct. 27, \n2023).   \n3. FDA moved to dismiss the petition for review or \nto transfer it to the D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit.  \nSee C.A. Doc. 43, at 23 (Oct. 18, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit \ndenied the motion in an unpublished order.  See Pet. \nApp. 1a-8a.   \nThe Fifth Circuit had previously held, in considering \nanother petition for review filed by Reynolds and joined \nby the remaining respondents, that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit.\u201d  Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 188.  In the decision \nbelow, the court stated that it was bound by that hold-\ning.  See Pet. App. 4a.  Elaborating on the earlier deci-\nsion\u2019s reasoning, the court stated that, because the To-\nbacco Control Act allows \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d to challenge the denial of an application for mar-\nketing authorization, e-cigarette sellers may \u201cchallenge \nFDA decisions that affect them.\u201d  Ibid. (citation and em-\nphasis omitted).  The court also concluded that, because \n\u201ctwo of the [four] Petitioners\u201d \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business here in the Fifth Circuit,\u201d all four \ncould file a petition for review there.  Id. at 3a.  \nJudge Higginson dissented.  See Pet. App. 6a-8a.  He \nobserved that the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of the \nAct effectively nullifies its venue limitations.  See id. at \n6a-7a.  He also stated that the court\u2019s \u201cexpansive read-\n\n7 \n \ning of venue cannot seem to be reconciled with the other \nprovisions of the [Act].\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn a separate order, the court of appeals granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion to stay FDA\u2019s denial order pending \nresolution of the petition for review.  See C.A. Doc. 133, \nat 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  Judge Higginson dissented from \nthat order as well.  See id. at 3 n.*.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a retailer may \nchallenge the denial of a manufacturer\u2019s application.  It \nerred again in holding that the out-of-circuit manufac-\nturer may ride the local retailer\u2019s coattails to establish \nvenue.  The combination of those errors deprives the \nTobacco Control Act\u2019s venue restrictions of meaningful \neffect.  \nA.  Under the Tobacco Control Act, an \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d person may seek judicial review of an FDA or-\nder denying an application for marketing authorization.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \u201cAdversely affected\u201d is a term of \nart in administrative law.  It invokes the zone-of-interests \ntest, under which an entity may seek judicial review \nonly if the interest it asserts falls within the zone of in-\nterests protected by the statutory provision at issue.  \nA retailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the provision at issue\u2014the provision that \nrequires FDA to adjudicate an application for market-\ning authorization.  See 21 U.S.C. 387j(c).  The order that \nFDA issues at the end of that adjudication speaks to the \napplicant alone (always or nearly always a manufac-\nturer of the product) and affects retailers only indi-\nrectly.  And while the provision grants procedural \nrights to the applicant itself, it shows no similar solici-\ntude for retailers.  It does not allow retailers to partici-\npate in the proceedings, does not grant them any proce-\n\n8 \n \ndural rights, and does not require FDA to account for \ntheir substantive interests.   \nThe statute\u2019s structure confirms that non-applicant \nretailers lack the right to challenge denial orders.  The \nAct contains a confidentiality provision that shields \ntrade secrets and other sensitive information submitted \nas part of the application process.  Because of that pro-\nvision, retailers will not necessarily know that a manu-\nfacturer has filed an application or that the agency has \ndenied it.  Congress would not have granted retailers \nthe right to challenge denial orders in court while deny-\ning them the right to know that such orders had been \nentered and the right to see the information necessary \nto mount an effective challenge to FDA\u2019s conclusion \nthat the applicant failed to show that the product at issue \nwould be appropriate for the protection of public health.  \nThe Act, moreover, forbids the sale of a new tobacco \nproduct unless and until FDA authorizes the marketing \nof the product.  An order denying a manufacturer\u2019s ap-\nplication thus leaves a retailer\u2019s legal rights unchanged:  \nThe retailer has no right to sell the product before the \ndenial, and it still lacks that right after the denial.  The \nretailers in this case unlawfully sold Reynolds\u2019 Vuse \nAlto products before FDA had acted on Reynolds\u2019 ap-\nplications, but their unlawful conduct cannot generate a \nright to judicial review that they would otherwise lack. \nB.  The Fifth Circuit also erred in holding that an \nout-of-circuit manufacturer may join a local retailer \nwho seeks judicial review in the circuit.  The Act pro-\nvides that a person may file a petition for review in a \ncircuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) only if \u201csuch per-\nson\u201d resides or has its principal place of business there.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The text thus makes clear that a \nperson may sue in a circuit only if that person is based \n\n9 \n \nthere.  A manufacturer may not sue based on a retailer\u2019s \nresidence.  \nTraditional principles of joinder confirm that read-\ning.  Joinder is a procedural device that enables suits \nthat could have been brought separately to be brought \nand processed together, not a tool for expanding the \nparties\u2019 rights or the court\u2019s power.  Because Reynolds \nhad no right to file its own petition in the Fifth Circuit, \nit also had no right to join someone else\u2019s petition there.  \nThe same result follows from traditional principles \nof venue.  This Court has long held that, except when \nCongress provides otherwise, venue must be proper as \nto each party in a multi-party case.  \u201c[E]ach plaintiff \nmust be competent to sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant must be \nliable to be sued\u201d in the chosen forum.  Smith v. Lyon, \n133 U.S. 315, 319 (1890).  Nothing in the language of the \nAct departs from that default rule.  \nC.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation deprives the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions of meaningful effect and ena-\nbles their ready evasion.  Congress specified three ven-\nues where a person may sue.  But under the decision \nbelow, an applicant may sue in any regional circuit any-\nwhere in the country so long as it finds a local retailer \nwilling to join its petition.  This Court should not adopt \nsuch a self-defeating interpretation of the statute.   \nARGUMENT \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides as follows:  \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A)  the promulgation of a regulation under [21 \nU.S.C. 387g] establishing, amending, or revoking \na tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B)  a denial of an application under [21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)], \n\n10 \n \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That provision allows a person to \nfile a petition for review of an FDA denial order in one \nof three circuits: the D.C. Circuit, the circuit where it \nresides, or the circuit where it maintains its principal \nplace of business.  When, as here, a venue statute does \nnot define what counts as a residence, this Court usually \nholds that a domestic corporation resides in the State of \nits incorporation.  See, e.g., TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft \nFoods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 262 (2017); \nShaw v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U.S. 444, 449 (1892).  \nThe Fifth Circuit, however, has read the Tobacco \nControl Act\u2019s venue provision to mean that a manufac-\nturer that neither resides nor maintains its principal \nplace of business in the circuit may nonetheless file a \npetition for review there, so long as the petition is joined \nby a local seller of the manufacturer\u2019s products.  See \nPet. App. 3a.  Reynolds, a manufacturer based in the \nFourth Circuit, has invoked that theory to file three pe-\ntitions for review, including the petition at issue here, in \nthe Fifth Circuit.1  At least eight other out-of-circuit \nmanufacturers\u2014based in China, California, Florida, \nMichigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington\u2014\n \n1  See p. 5, supra; Pet. for Review at 3, R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. \nFDA, No. 23-60037 (5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023); Pet. for Review at 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023).   \n\n11 \n \nhave since relied on the same tactic to seek judicial re-\nview in the Fifth Circuit.2   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of the Act rests on two \nindependent errors.  First, the court erred in holding \nthat a retail seller may seek judicial review of an FDA \norder denying a manufacturer\u2019s application.  Second, \nthe court erred in holding that venue need be proper \nonly as to one party, rather than all the parties.  Those \ntwo errors, in combination, effectively nullify the Act\u2019s \nlimits on venue.  This Court should reverse the court of \nappeals\u2019 order and remand with instructions to transfer \nthe case to the D.C. Circuit.  See C.A. Doc. 80, at 38 (Oct. \n30, 2023) (stating that respondents prefer the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to the Fourth Circuit).  \nA.

Newport \nNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 \n(1995).  The APA authorizes judicial review at the behest \nof an \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d person.  5 U.S.C. \n702.  Many agency-specific statutes likewise use the \nterms \u201cadversely affected\u201d and \u201caggrieved,\u201d alone or in \ncombination, to designate those who may challenge \nagency action.  See Newport News, 514 U.S. at 126. \nThe terms \u201cadversely affected\u201d and \u201caggrieved\u201d in-\nvoke the zone-of-interests test.  See, e.g., Thompson v. \nNorth American Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011); \nLujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, \n886 (1990).  Under that test, a plaintiff may seek judicial \nreview only if its interests \u201cfall within the zone of inter-\nests protected by the law invoked.\u201d  Lexmark Interna-\ntional, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. \n118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted).   \n\u201c[T]he breadth of the zone of interests varies accord-\ning to the provisions of law at issue.\u201d  Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997); see Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n126 (\u201c[W]hat constitutes adverse effect or aggrieve-\nment varies from statute to statute.\u201d) (citation and em-\nphasis omitted).  In APA cases, the zone-of-interests \ntest is not \u201cespecially demanding.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. \nat 130 (citation omitted).  In that context, the Court has \n\u201cconspicuously included the word \u2018arguably\u2019 in the test \nto indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the \nplaintiff.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  That \u201clenient ap-\nproach\u201d preserves \u201cthe flexibility of the APA\u2019s omnibus \njudicial-review provision, which permits suits for viola-\ntions of numerous statutes of varying character.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThat lenient approach does not, however, carry over \nto other statutes.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  In \n\n13 \n \nnon-APA cases, a court should generally ask whether \nthe interest asserted by the plaintiff actually (rather \nthan just arguably) falls within the zone protected by \nthe statute.  See id. at 129.  As a result, \u201cwhat comes \nwithin the zone of interests  * * *  for purposes of  * * *  \nthe \u2018generous review provisions\u2019 of the APA may not do \nso for other purposes.\u201d  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163 (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA court should discern the breadth of the zone of  \ninterests\u2014or, said otherwise, identify the types of \nharms that qualify as adverse effects\u2014using the normal \ntools of statutory interpretation, including text, struc-\nture, and precedent.  See Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n127-136.  In this case, those tools show that a retailer \nmay not challenge an order denying a manufacturer\u2019s \napplication for marketing authorization.   \n1. A retailer\u2019s interests fall outside the zone of interests \nprotected by the statutory provision at issue \nIn applying the zone-of-interests test, a court should \nfocus on \u201cthe particular provision of law upon which the \nplaintiff relies,\u201d not on the \u201coverall purpose of the Act.\u201d  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 175-176.  The plaintiff must show \nthat its interest falls within the zone protected by \u201cthe \nstatutory provision whose violation forms the legal ba-\nsis for [the] complaint.\u201d  National Wildlife Federation, \n497 U.S. at 883.  Applying the test at a higher \u201clevel of \ngenerality\u201d risks depriving it \u201cof virtually all meaning.\u201d  \nAir Courier Conference of America v. American Postal \nWorkers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 529-530 (1991).   \nRespondents claim that FDA acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously in applying 21 U.S.C. 387j(c), the provision \nof the Tobacco Control Act directing the agency to act \non applications for marketing authorization.  See pp. 4-\n5, supra.  The judicial-review provision that they invoke \n\n14 \n \nauthorizes courts to review \u201ca denial of an application \nunder section 387j(c) of this title.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B) \n(emphasis added).  Respondents must therefore show \nthat Section 387j(c) protects not only the interests of the \napplicant itself, but also the interests of retail sellers of \nthe applicant\u2019s products.  Respondents cannot make \nthat showing.   \na. Section 387j(c) directs FDA to issue an \u201corder\u201d \nafter adjudicating an application.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A); \nsee 5 U.S.C. 551(6) (APA\u2019s definition of \u201corder\u201d).  Con-\ngress modeled administrative adjudications on court \nproceedings.  See Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 110 (2000).  \nLike a court order, an agency order ordinarily ad-\ndresses particular parties, not the \u201cworld at large.\u201d   \nRadiofone, Inc. v. FCC, 759 F.2d 936, 938 (D.C. Cir. \n1985) (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Under Section 387j(c), after \nevaluating an application, FDA must issue either \u201can \norder that the new product may be introduced\u201d or \u201can \norder that the new product may not be introduced\u201d into \ninterstate commerce.  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(1)(A).  That or-\nder is issued to the applicant alone.  Because the order \nregulates only the applicant, the prohibition upon arbi-\ntrary and capricious decision-making in the issuance of \nthe order seeks to protect only the applicant.  It does \nnot seek to protect retailers, who are strangers to the \nadjudication. \nTo be sure, denial orders may have indirect conse-\nquences for retailers:  If a manufacturer lacks authori-\nzation to sell a product, retailers cannot lawfully obtain \nand resell it.  But that indirect effect does not entitle \nretailers to judicial review of FDA\u2019s decision on a man-\nufacturer\u2019s application.  Our legal system has long dis-\ntinguished between \u201caction that directly affects a citi-\nzen\u2019s legal rights\u201d and \u201caction that is directed against a \n\n15 \n \nthird party and affects the citizen only indirectly or in-\ncidentally.\u201d  O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, \n447 U.S. 773, 788 (1980); see Department of State v. \nMu\u00f1oz, 602 U.S. 899, 917-919 (2024); Legal Tender \nCases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871).  When agency action \u201cdi-\nrectly affects\u201d one person and \u201ccauses only a conse-\nquential detriment\u201d to a bystander, the bystander has a \nweak claim to judicial review\u2014especially when (as here) \nits interests can be \u201cadequately protected by the person \ndirectly affected.\u201d  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Commit-\ntee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 153-154 (1951) (Frankfur-\nter, J., concurring).  Indeed, a claim based on a \u201cderiv-\native\u201d harm is \u201cprecisely the sort of claim that the pru-\ndential standing doctrine\u201d (as the zone-of-interests test \nis sometimes known) \u201cis designed to foreclose.\u201d  Center \nfor Reproductive Law & Policy v. Bush, 304 F.3d 183, \n196 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J.). \nThis case, in addition, differs meaningfully from \ncases where this Court has held that a bystander may \nchallenge an agency order.  Although the Act provides \nfor review only of denials of applications, see 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1)(B), some other statutes authorize adversely \naffected or aggrieved persons to seek review of both \ngrants and denials of applications, see, e.g., 47 U.S.C. \n402(b)(6).  Such statutes may even allow \u201cpersons with \ninterests adverse to the winning party,\u201d such as \u201ccom-\npetitors,\u201d to challenge an agency order granting an ap-\nplication.  Radiofone, 759 F.2d at 939 (opinion of Scalia, \nJ.); see, e.g., FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, \n309 U.S. 470, 476-477 (1940).  Unlike competitors, how-\never, the retailers here are not adverse to the manufac-\nturer.  Their interests, rather, derive from the manufac-\nturer\u2019s and are \u201cadequately protected\u201d by the manufac-\nturer\u2019s own ability to seek review of the denial of its ap-\n\n16 \n \nplication.  Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, 341 \nU.S. at 154 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  \nb. The rest of Section 387j\u2014the section establishing \nthe process for applying for marketing authorization\u2014\nconfirms that Section 387j(c) does not seek to protect \nretailers.  Section 387j authorizes an applicant to file an \napplication with FDA, see 21 U.S.C. 387j(b), and then \ndirects FDA to issue a decision after considering \u201cthe \ninformation submitted to [it] as part of the application,\u201d \n21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2).  Section 387j does not give retailers \nany role in that process.  It does not authorize them to \nintervene, to submit additional evidence, or to comment \non the agency\u2019s proposed action.   \nSection 387j also confers various procedural rights \nupon the applicant alone.  For example, \u201can applicant\u201d \nmay ask FDA to refer the application to a special scien-\ntific committee.  21 U.S.C. 387j(b)(2)(B).  FDA must \nserve its order on \u201cthe applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(e)(2).  \nAnd if FDA denies an application, it must, to the extent \npracticable, provide a \u201cstatement informing the appli-\ncant of the measures required to remove such applica-\ntion from deniable form\u201d\u2014measures that may include \n\u201cfurther research by the applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(3).  \nSection 387j, by contrast, grants no procedural rights to \nretailers.  Retailers have no right to make requests \nabout the processing of the application, no right to no-\ntice of the agency\u2019s order, no right to know the reasons \nfor a denial, and no right to know what changes could be \nmade to make the application grantable.  \nThe substantive standard that Section 387j requires \nFDA to apply likewise reveals no concern for retailers\u2019 \nparticular interests.  The agency may authorize the \nmarketing of a new tobacco product only if the applicant \nshows that authorization would be \u201cappropriate for the \n\n17 \n \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).  \nThe Act requires the agency, in applying that test, to \nweigh (1) the likelihood that the new product will help \nexisting smokers \u201cstop using\u201d tobacco products and  \n(2) the risk that the new product will prompt non- \nsmokers to \u201cstart using\u201d tobacco products.  21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)(4).  But the Act does not direct the agency to \nweigh any interests of potential retailers, such as the \nnew product\u2019s effects on their revenues.  \nIn sum, Section 387j requires FDA to issue an order \ndirected to the applicant, not to retailers.  It does not \ngive retailers a role in the agency process, does not \ngrant them any procedural protections, and does not re-\nquire the agency to consider their substantive interests.  \nIn fact, Section 387j does not mention retailers at all.  \nThe statutory text and context thus strongly suggest \nthat retailers\u2019 interests fall outside the zone of interests \nthat Section 387j(c) protects.  \nc. The contrary reading of the Act lacks an obvious \nstopping point.  This case involves retailers that have \npreviously sold the product at issue, but respondents\u2019 \nreasoning would seem to extend even further.  Taken to \nits logical conclusion, it would permit judicial review at \nthe behest of a retailer that has never sold the product \nbut would like to do so once the product is authorized.  \nIt would also permit review at the behest of a consumer \nwho uses the product\u2014or, for that matter, a consumer \nwho does not yet use it but would like to do so.  A court \nshould not lightly infer that an agency order directed to \na specific applicant may be challenged by such a broad \nclass of bystanders.  \nThe contrary reading would also allow a retailer (and \nperhaps a consumer) to file a petition for review without \nregard to the wishes of the unsuccessful applicant.  A \n\n18 \n \nretailer could seek judicial review even if the applicant \nprefers to drop the case (e.g., in favor of filing a new \napplication).  Or a retailer could insist on litigating in \none circuit even if the applicant prefers another one \nwhere it is permitted to file.  Allowing retailers and \nother bystanders to file their own challenges would thus \nundermine \u201cthe autonomy of those persons likely to be \nmost directly affected by [the agency\u2019s] order.\u201d  Valley \nForge Christian College v. Americans United for Sepa-\nration of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982). \n2. The structure of the statutory scheme confirms that \na retailer may not challenge an FDA order denying a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application \nA court should always seek to interpret a statute \u201cas \na symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\u201d and to \n\u201cfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.\u201d  \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. \n120, 133 (2000) (citations omitted); see Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law 167 (2012).  Statutory \nstructure is especially relevant to the interpretation of \nthe term \u201cadversely affected.\u201d  Discerning which harms \nconstitute adverse effects often involves inferences \ndrawn from the nature of the \u201cstatutory scheme.\u201d  New-\nport News, 514 U.S. at 127 (citation omitted).  Here, sev-\neral features of the statutory framework confirm that a \nretailer lacks the right to challenge the denial of a man-\nufacturer\u2019s application.  \na. The Tobacco Control Act includes a provision that \nprotects \u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d \u201ctrade secrets and \ncommercial or financial information\u201d submitted by an \napplicant as part of the application process.  5 U.S.C. \n552(b)(4); see 21 U.S.C. 387f(c) (cross-referencing 5 \nU.S.C. 552(b)(4)).  The Act provides that such infor-\nmation \u201cshall be considered confidential and shall not \n\n19 \n \nbe disclosed,\u201d except in specified circumstances.  21 \nU.S.C. 387f(c).   \nBecause of the confidentiality provision, retailers \nand other members of the public will not necessarily \nknow that a manufacturer has applied for authorization \nto market a new tobacco product.  \u201c[T]he intent to mar-\nket a tobacco product that is not currently marketed is \noften considered confidential commercial information.\u201d  \n86 Fed. Reg. 55,300, 55,398 (Oct. 5, 2021).  FDA thus \ngenerally \u201cwill not publicly disclose the existence of an \napplication.\u201d  21 C.F.R. 1114.47(b)(1).   \nRetailers and other members of the public likewise \nwill not necessarily know that FDA has denied a partic-\nular manufacturer\u2019s application or what particular \nproduct was subject to agency adjudication.  \u201cEven af-\nter receipt of a marketing denial order,\u201d \u201cthe intent to \nmarket may still constitute confidential commercial in-\nformation.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. at 55,398.  When FDA denies \nan application, therefore, it limits public disclosures to \nnon-confidential information, such as the \u201ctobacco prod-\nuct category (e.g., cigarette),\u201d the \u201ctobacco product sub-\ncategory (e.g., filtered, combusted cigarette),\u201d and the \n\u201ccharacterizing flavor.\u201d  21 C.F.R. 1114.47(d).  Unless \nthe manufacturer has disclosed its intent to market the \nproduct, the agency does not identify the specific prod-\nuct for which marketing authorization was denied.  \nEven when the public knows that a manufacturer has \napplied for marketing authorization and that FDA has \ndenied the application, the confidentiality provision pre-\ncludes full disclosure of the contents of the application, \ndenial order, and agency record.  Here, for example, \nReynolds successfully moved to seal its filings in the \ncourt of appeals in order to protect \u201cconfidential and \nproprietary information concerning Vuse products\u2019 de-\n\n20 \n \nsign, components, and other highly sensitive technical \ndetails that have not been made available to the public.\u201d  \nC.A. Doc. 59, at 3.  It observed that \u201cFDA has repeat-\nedly recognized the need to prevent public disclosure of \nconfidential and sensitive information contained in sub-\nmissions like the Vuse applications.\u201d  Id. at 9. \nThe confidentiality provision reinforces retailers\u2019 \nlack of any right to seek judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n7a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  A person can seek judi-\ncial review only if it knows that a manufacturer has filed \nan application and that FDA has denied it.  There is no \nreason to think that Congress wanted a non-applicant \nretailer to be able to obtain judicial review if it could \nsomehow learn the non-public fact that an application \nhad been filed by someone else and had been denied in \nthe 30 days preceding the retailer\u2019s petition for review.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B). \nA person, moreover, can \u201cmake a considered decision \nwhether to seek judicial review\u201d only if it knows the \nagency\u2019s \u201creasons for the denial.\u201d  T-Mobile South, LLC \nv. City of Roswell, 574 U.S. 293, 304 (2015).  That is par-\nticularly true under the Tobacco Control Act, which in-\nstructs courts to review denials under the arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(b) (citing 5 \nU.S.C. 706(2)(A)).  It is implausible that Congress granted \nretailers a right to litigate record-intensive arbitrary-\nand-capricious challenges while denying them the right \nto see the administrative record.   \nb. The Tobacco Control Act\u2019s separate provisions \ngoverning sales of tobacco products support the conclu-\nsion that denial orders do not adversely affect retailers.  \nThose provisions make it unlawful to sell a new tobacco \nproduct unless and until FDA authorizes its marketing.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 331(c), 387b(6)(A).  Given those provi-\n\n21 \n \nsions, an order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nhas no effect on a retailer\u2019s legal rights or duties.  The \nretailer has no legal right to sell the unauthorized prod-\nuct before the denial order, and it still lacks that right \nafter the order.  Because a denial order leaves the re-\ntailer\u2019s legal position unchanged, the order does not \n\u201cadversely affect\u201d the retailer. \nA denial order, at most, affects a retailer\u2019s expecta-\ntions about the likelihood of FDA enforcement action.  \nUnder the enforcement policy in effect when Reynolds \nsubmitted its applications, FDA\u2019s enforcement priori-\nties included products for which marketing applications \nhad been denied.  See p. 4, supra.  But an increase in \nthe likelihood that FDA will enforce the law is not an \n\u201cadverse effect.\u201d  The scope of the term \u201cadversely af-\nfected\u201d depends on the statute\u2019s meaning when enacted, \nnot on FDA\u2019s post-enactment enforcement choices.  \nTreating a change in the odds of enforcement as a judi-\ncially cognizable harm would undermine the Executive \nBranch\u2019s exclusive Article II power to decide \u201chow to \nprioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions \nagainst defendants who violate the law.\u201d  United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 678 (2023) (citation omitted).   \nIn this case, the retailers explain that they have been \nselling Reynolds\u2019 Vuse Alto products since before FDA \nresolved Reynolds\u2019 applications.  See C.A. Pet. for Re-\nview 3.  They fear that, now that FDA has denied the \napplications, it will enforce the Act against them, so that \nthey \u201cwill no longer be able to sell\u201d the products.  Ibid.  \nBut those sales have violated the Act all along (even if \nthey were not identified as priorities for FDA enforce-\nment), and an interest in continuing to violate the law \nnecessarily falls outside the zone of interests that the \nlaw seeks to protect.  A retailer that has started unlaw-\n\n22 \n \nfully selling an unauthorized product may not seek ju-\ndicial review on the ground that a denial order reduces \nthe chances that FDA will continue to refrain from tak-\ning action against those violations.  Respondents\u2019 con-\ntrary argument runs up against \u201cthe basic notion that \nno court will lend its aid to one who founds a cause of \naction upon an  * * *  illegal act.\u201d  Paperworkers v. \nMisco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42 (1987); see Holman v. John-\nson, 98 Eng. Rep. 1120, 1121 (K.B. 1775) (Lord Mans-\nfield, L.C.J.) (\u201cIf, from the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s own stating or oth-\nerwise, the cause of action appears to arise  * * *  [from] \nthe transgression of a positive law of this country, there \nthe Court says he has no right to be assisted.\u201d).   \nc. Finally, the Act empowers FDA to withdraw a \ngrant of marketing authorization in some circumstances \n\u2014for instance, if it finds that \u201cthe continued marketing \nof [the] tobacco product no longer is appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(1)(A).  \nThe Act provides that the \u201cholder of an application\u201d \nmay obtain review of a withdrawal order \u201cin accordance \nwith section 387l,\u201d the judicial-review provision at issue \nhere.  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2).  \nThe statutory text makes plain, and respondents \nagree (Br. in Opp. 11), that the Act does not allow a re-\ntailer to challenge an order withdrawing authorization.  \nBut a withdrawal order, which forces a retailer to stop \npreviously lawful sales, affects a retailer\u2019s interests far \nmore directly than a denial order.  See Pet. App. 7a \n(Higginson, J., dissenting).  Respondents have prof-\nfered no persuasive reason why Congress would have \nwanted to allow retailers to challenge the denial of au-\nthorization to market a new tobacco product at the out-\nset, but not to challenge the agency\u2019s withdrawal of a \nprevious authorization.   \n\n23 \n \nReinforcing that point, Congress required FDA to \nfollow more robust procedures when issuing withdrawal \norders than when issuing denial orders.  Before the \nagency issues a withdrawal order, it must provide the \napplicant with a hearing, see 21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(1), in \nwhich the applicant enjoys specified procedural rights, \nsee 21 U.S.C. 321(x).  It would have been strange for \nCongress to conclude that granting additional proce-\ndural rights to the applicant somehow compensated for \ndenying judicial review to entities other than the appli-\ncant.   \n3. Precedent confirms that retailers lack the right to \nseek judicial review  \nThe interpretive issue presented in this case closely \nresembles the interpretive issue resolved in Block v. \nCommunity Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984).  \nThe statute in Block empowered an agency to issue \nmarket orders setting minimum prices to be paid by \nmilk handlers to milk producers.  See id. at 341-342.  It \nauthorized handlers to seek judicial review of market \norders, but only after exhausting administrative reme-\ndies.  See id. at 346.  A handler tried to bypass that ex-\nhaustion requirement by joining a group of milk con-\nsumers to challenge a market order under the APA.  \nSee id. at 344-345.  \nThe D.C. Circuit held that the consumers could sue, \nbut then-Judge Scalia dissented from that aspect of its \ndecision.  See Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, \n698 F.2d 1239, 1256-1258 (1983) (Scalia, J., concurring \nin part and dissenting in part), rev\u2019d, 467 U.S. 340 \n(1984).  Judge Scalia emphasized that the market orders \nhad a \u201cdirect and immediate\u201d effect on handlers, but \nonly an \u201cindirect\u201d effect on consumers.  Id. at 1257.  He \nreasoned that, because the \u201cimmediately affected\u201d group \n\n24 \n \n(handlers) was \u201creadily identifiable\u201d and could be \u201cre-\nlied upon to challenge agency disregard of the law,\u201d the \n\u201cmore remote\u201d group (consumers) could not be \u201cfound \nto meet the zone of interests test.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThis Court agreed with Judge Scalia that consumers \nlacked the right to challenge milk market orders.  See \nBlock, 467 U.S. at 346-348.  The Court emphasized that, \nalthough the statute authorized handlers \u201cto participate \nin the adoption and retention of market orders,\u201d it con-\ntained no \u201cexpress provision for participation by con-\nsumers.\u201d  Id. at 346-347.  The Court inferred that, be-\ncause Congress had excluded consumers from the \u201creg-\nulatory process,\u201d it \u201cintended a similar restriction of ju-\ndicial review.\u201d  Id. at 347.  The Court added that allow-\ning consumer suits \u201cwould provide handlers with a con-\nvenient device for evading the statutory [exhaustion] \nrequirement\u201d; a handler \u201cwould need only to find a con-\nsumer who is willing to join in or initiate an action in the \ndistrict court.\u201d  Id. at 348.  Because that result would \n\u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the exhaustion requirement, the \nCourt found it \u201cclear that Congress intended that judi-\ncial review of market orders  * * *  ordinarily be con-\nfined to suits brought by handlers.\u201d  Ibid.   \nMost of this Court\u2019s and Judge Scalia\u2019s reasoning in \nBlock also applies here.  An FDA order denying an ap-\nplication for marketing authorization has a direct and \nimmediate effect on the applicant itself, but only an in-\ndirect and incidental effect on retail sellers of the appli-\ncant\u2019s products.  The Act authorizes the applicant itself \nto participate in the regulatory process, but it contains \nno provision for participation by retailers.  And allowing \nretailer suits could hand applicants a convenient device \nfor evading the Act\u2019s venue restrictions; unless this \nCourt rejects the court of appeals\u2019 rule that venue need \n\n25 \n \nbe proper only as to one party, a disappointed applicant \ncould simply find a retailer that is willing to join in a \npetition for review in a preferred circuit.  Those fea-\ntures of the statutory scheme all indicate that only ap-\nplicants, not retailers, may seek judicial review of or-\nders denying applications.  \nIn some respects, this case follows a fortiori from \nBlock.  Block involved a suit under the APA, see 467 \nU.S. at 345, while this case involves a petition for review \nunder the Tobacco Control Act.  The Court has applied \nthe zone-of-interests test more stringently in non-APA \ncases than in APA cases.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130.  \nBlock also involved judicial review of a rulemaking, see \n467 U.S. at 342, while this case involves judicial review \nof an adjudication.  It is particularly natural to infer that \nonly the parties to an adjudication may challenge its \noutcome in court.  See p. 14, supra.   \n4. The court of appeals\u2019 reasoning is flawed \nThe court of appeals reasoned that a retail seller may \nseek judicial review of a denial order because such an \norder \u201caffect[s]\u201d the seller by reducing its sales.  Pet. \nApp. 4a.  But as explained above, the phrase \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d is a term of art in administrative law.  See pp. \n11-12, supra.  The critical question is not whether a de-\nnial order harms the seller in some way; it is whether \nthat harm \u201cconstitutes adverse effect\u201d within the mean-\ning of the Act.  Newport News, 514 U.S. at 126 (empha-\nsis omitted).  For the reasons given above, the Act\u2019s \nstructure shows that it does not.   \nThe court of appeals also emphasized that the statute \nrefers to \u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d  Pet. App. 4a \n(quoting 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)).  But \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 can-\nnot expand the phrase\u201d that follows.  National Ass\u2019n of \nManufacturers v. Department of Defense, 583 U.S. 109, \n\n26 \n \n123 (2018).  Despite the inclusion of the word \u201cany,\u201d the \nterm \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d still requires a \nshowing that the person has been \u201cadversely affected,\u201d \nwhich in turn requires a showing that the person falls \nwithin the zone of interests protected by the statutory \nprovision at issue.  See, e.g., Newport News, 514 U.S. at \n126 (interpreting 33 U.S.C. 921(c), which referred to \n\u201cany person adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d) (brackets \nomitted).   \nThe court of appeals next contrasted the provision at \nissue here\u2014under which an \u201cadversely affected\u201d person \nmay challenge a denial order, 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)\u2014with \nthe provision under which the \u201cholder of an application\u201d \nmay challenge a withdrawal order, 21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2).  \nSee Pet. App. 4a-5a.  The court read too much into that \ncontrast.  The provision at issue authorizes judicial re-\nview not only of a \u201cdenial\u201d of an application, but also of \na \u201cregulation\u201d establishing, amending, or revoking a to-\nbacco product standard.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The term \n\u201cholder of an application,\u201d used in the narrower provi-\nsion specifically addressing judicial review of with-\ndrawal orders, would have been a poor fit for the full \nrange of agency actions covered by the provision here.  \nIf anything, the provision concerning judicial review of \nwithdrawal orders cuts against the court of appeals\u2019 \nreading.  It would have been incongruous for Congress \nto allow retailers to challenge denial orders, but not to \nchallenge withdrawal orders.  See pp. 22-23, supra.    \nFinally, the court of appeals stated that concerns \nabout petitions for review filed by retailers should be \n\u201cdirected to Congress,\u201d not to the courts.  Pet. App. 5a.  \nBut that suggestion rests on the mistaken premise that \nthe statute, as written, allows retailers to seek judicial \nreview.  The term \u201cadversely affected\u201d requires \u201cthe \n\n27 \n \ncourts\u201d to infer, \u201cin the context of  * * *  the particular \nstatutory pattern,\u201d \u201cwho is entitled to judicial review.\u201d  \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on \nthe Administrative Procedure Act 96 (1947); see New-\nport News, 514 U.S. at 126-127 (quoting the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Manual).  Courts must carry out the function \nthat Congress entrusted to them.  And as discussed \nabove, the statutory pattern here shows that retailers \nmay not challenge an FDA order denying a manufac-\nturer\u2019s application. \nB. A Manufacturer May File A Petition For Review Only \nIn The D.C. Circuit Or The Circuit Where It Is Based  \nThe Fifth Circuit further erred by holding that a \ngroup of petitioners may file a petition for review in a \ncircuit so long as \u201ca petitioner\u201d resides or maintains its \nprincipal place of business within that circuit.  R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 188 (5th Cir. \n2023) (emphasis added); see Pet. App. 5a.  Unless Con-\ngress provides otherwise, courts must evaluate venue \nparty by party, and venue must be proper as to each \nparty.  A petitioner for whom venue is improper may not \nsimply tag along with one for whom it is proper.  See \nAmerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Commis-\nsion, 338 F.2d 808, 809-810 (10th Cir. 1964) (interpret-\ning a similarly worded venue statute to mean that an out-\nof-circuit petitioner could not join a local petitioner); Na-\ntional Family Farm Coalition v. EPA, 966 F.3d 893, \n930-932 (9th Cir. 2020) (Nelson, J., concurring) (same).  \n1. The Act does not authorize one person to lay venue \nbased on a different person\u2019s residence or principal \nplace of business \nIn general, a party may bring a suit only if a statute \nauthorizes it to do so.  See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \n\n28 \n \nU.S. 275, 286-287 (2001).  That authorization ordinarily \nmust be explicit; Congress usually does not create new \nremedies by implication.  See Cummings v. Premier \nRehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 226 (2022).  The \ngovernment thus does not bear the burden of showing \nthat the Tobacco Control Act prohibits Reynolds from \nseeking judicial review in the Fifth Circuit.  Instead, re-\nspondents bear the burden of proving that the Act af-\nfirmatively authorizes Reynolds to do so.  They cannot \nmake that showing. \nThe Act states that \u201cany person adversely affected \nby [a] regulation or denial may file a petition for judicial \nreview of such regulation or denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added).  The word \u201csuch,\u201d when used to modify a \nnoun, refers back to something \u201cpreviously spoken of.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, 477 (1827).  \nThe term \u201csuch person\u201d thus makes clear that a person \nmay seek judicial review in a circuit (other than the D.C. \nCircuit) only if that person is based in that circuit.  \nParty A may not sue in a circuit just because party B \nlives there.  The court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatute to allow a person to sue in \u201cthe circuit in which \nsuch person [or a retail seller of such person\u2019s products] \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d  21 \nU.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \nThe Act also uses singular rather than plural nouns, \nauthorizing a \u201cperson\u201d to file \u201ca petition\u201d in the circuit \nwhere the \u201cperson\u201d resides or has its principal place of \nbusiness.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That matters because \nthe use of the singular or the plural can illuminate a \nstatute\u2019s meaning.  See Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. 155, 161-164 (2021); Life Technologies Corp. v. \nPromega Corp., 580 U.S. 140, 149-151 (2017).  Here, the \n\u201cuse of the singular noun \u2018person\u2019  * * *  suggests venue \nshould be analyzed on a petitioner-by-petitioner basis.\u201d  \nNational Family Farm Coalition, 966 F.3d at 930 (Nel-\nson, J., concurring). \nFinally, the Act lists three venues in which a person \nmay seek judicial review: the D.C. Circuit, the circuit \nwhere the person resides, and the circuit in which the \nperson has its principal place of business.  See 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1).  The Act\u2019s enumeration of those three options \nimplies the exclusion of others, such as the circuit where \na co-petitioner resides.  Expressio unius est exclusio al-\nterius.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 300 \n(2018); Scalia & Garner 107. \n2. Traditional principles of joinder confirm that an out-\nof-circuit manufacturer does not acquire a right to \nsue in a circuit by joining a local retailer \nAlthough the Act does not address the filing of joint \npetitions, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure \nprovide that \u201ctwo or more persons may join in a petition \nto the same court to review the same order\u201d if \u201ctheir \ninterests make joinder practicable.\u201d  Fed. R. App. P. \n15(a)(1).  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure similarly \nallow multiple plaintiffs to join in one complaint.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).  Joinder, however, just allows \nsuits that could have been brought separately to be \nbrought together; it does not allow an out-of-circuit \nmanufacturer to piggyback on a local retailer\u2019s claims.   \nJoinder is a device for the \u201caggregation of claims.\u201d  \nSprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., \n554 U.S. 269, 291 (2008).  Although it \u201cenables a federal \ncourt to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, \ninstead of in separate suits,\u201d it \u201cleaves the parties\u2019 legal \n\n30 \n \nrights and duties intact and the rules of decision un-\nchanged.\u201d  Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. All-\nstate Insurance Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality \nopinion).  Said otherwise, joinder rules \u201care procedural \nmeans of processing claims, not fonts of judicial author-\nity.\u201d  Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, 362 \n(2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part).  \nThus, if multiple plaintiffs join in one complaint, \n\u201ceach plaintiff\u200a\u2019s right of action remains distinct, as if it \nhad been brought separately.\u201d  7 Charles Alan Wright \net al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1652, at 414 \n(4th ed. 2019) (Wright & Miller).  Joinder cannot \u201cres-\ncue claims that would have been doomed  * * *  if they \nhad been asserted in a separate action\u201d; conversely, it \ndoes not require \u201cdismissal of claims that would have \notherwise survived.\u201d  Rockwell International Corp. v. \nUnited States, 549 U.S. 457, 476 (2007) (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Merena v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., \n205 F.3d 97, 103 (3d Cir. 2000) (Alito, J.)).   \nThe Tobacco Control Act plainly would not allow \nReynolds to file its own petition for review in the Fifth \nCircuit.  Under ordinary principles of joinder, it follows \nthat Reynolds is equally unable to join someone else\u2019s \npetition in that circuit.  \n3. Traditional principles of venue confirm that venue \nmust be proper as to each petitioner  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the Act conflicts \nnot only with statutory text and traditional principles of \njoinder, but also with traditional principles of venue.  \n\u201cFaced with multi-party cases,\u201d this Court \u201clong ago \nheld that venue must be proper as to each party.\u201d  14D \nWright & Miller \u00a7 3807, at 204 (4th ed. 2013).  Today, \u201cit \nis common for courts to say that venue must be proper \n\n31 \n \nas to each claim and as to each party.\u201d  Id. at 206-207.  \nTreatise writers agree that, \u201cwhen a special venue stat-\nute allows venue where the plaintiff resides,\u201d \u201cvenue \nwould not be proper for [multiple] plaintiffs in a district \nin which only one of them resides.\u201d  Id. at 206. \nThis Court first applied that party-specific approach \nin interpreting a 19th-century statute authorizing a \nplaintiff to bring a diversity suit \u201cin the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defend[a]nt.\u201d  Act \nof Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 373, \u00a7 1, 24 Stat. 552-553.  In Smith \nv. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890), the Court held that the \nstatute\u2019s reference to \u201cthe plaintiff\u200a\u201d meant every plain-\ntiff, not just one plaintiff.  See id. at 317-320.  And in \nCamp v. Gress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919), the Court held that \nthe term \u201cthe defendant\u201d in a similarly worded succes-\nsor statute meant every defendant, not just one defend-\nant.  See id. at 311-316.  Those decisions establish that, \nin a multi-party case, \u201ceach plaintiff must be competent \nto sue\u201d and \u201ceach defendant must be liable to be sued\u201d \nin the chosen forum.  Smith, 133 U.S. at 319 (citation \nomitted); see Camp, 250 U.S. at 312 (requiring \u201ceach\u201d \nparty to be \u201ccompetent to sue, or liable to be sued,\u201d in \nthe chosen court) (citation omitted).  \nThis Court adhered to that approach in Bankers Life \n& Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379 (1953).  The \nvenue statute there allowed an antitrust plaintiff to sue \n\u201cin the district in which the defendant resides or is \nfound or has an agent.\u201d  15 U.S.C. 15(a).  Even though \nantitrust cases routinely involve conspiracies among \nmultiple defendants, the Court analyzed venue one de-\nfendant at a time.  See Holland, 346 U.S. at 384.  It ex-\nplained that, when venue does not \u201clie in one district as \nto all defendants,\u201d proceedings would need to be \u201csev-\nered and transferred or filed in separate districts origi-\n\n32 \n \nnally.\u201d  Ibid.  The plaintiff had argued that each anti-\ntrust defendant could be regarded as an \u201cagent\u201d of his \nco-conspirators, enabling all of them to be sued where \nany one of them lived.  See id. at 380-381.  But the Court \nrejected that theory, stating that it had \u201call the ear-\nmarks of a frivolous albeit ingenious attempt to expand \nthe statute,\u201d which had \u201cplaced definite limits on \nvenue.\u201d  Id. at 384.  The Court thus explained that \n\u201cmany such cases would not lie in one district as to all \ndefendants, unless venue was waived\u201d as a defense.  \nIbid. \nIn fact, other precedents of this Court require courts \nto evaluate venue not just party by party, but claim by \nclaim.  See Geneva Furniture Manufacturing Co. v.  \nS. Karpen & Bros., 238 U.S. 254, 258-259 (1915).  In \nother words, \u201cif the plaintiff asserts multiple claims \nagainst the defendant, venue must be proper for each \nclaim.\u201d  14D Wright & Miller \u00a7 3808, at 213.  That rule \nconfirms the broader principle that venue \u201ccannot be \nenlarged or extended by uniting [different causes of ac-\ntion] in a single suit.\u201d  Geneva, 238 U.S. at 259.  \nThis Court\u2019s party-by-party approach to venue is \nconsistent with its party-by-party approach to other \nthreshold statutory requirements.  For example, the \nCourt has long interpreted the diversity-jurisdiction \nstatute to require complete diversity; each plaintiff \nmust be diverse from each defendant.  See Strawbridge \nv. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267, 267-268 (1806).  The Court has \nread amount-in-controversy requirements, in the diver-\nsity statute as well as in other jurisdictional grants, to \nmean that \u201ceach of several plaintiffs is bound to estab-\nlish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own \nclaim.\u201d  Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 590 \n(1939); see Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U.S. \n\n33 \n \n291, 294-295 & n.3 (1973) (collecting cases).  And the \nCourt has interpreted the removal statute to mean that, \nwhen \u201cthere is more than one defendant, all the defend-\nants must join\u201d in removing the case from state to fed-\neral court.  Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur, & Evansville \nRy. Co., 179 U.S. 335, 337 (1900); see Chicago, Rock Is-\nland, & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Martin, 178 U.S. 245, 248 \n(1900).   \nThe party-by-party approach to venue vindicates the \ngeneral purpose of such provisions.  The plaintiff, as \nmaster of its complaint, controls which co-plaintiffs and \nco-defendants it will name.  But \u201cthe purpose of statu-\ntorily specified venue is to protect the defendant.\u201d  \nLeroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 183-\n184 (1979).  Venue restrictions would not serve that pur-\npose if a plaintiff could evade them simply by adding \nmore parties to its complaint.  \nThe principle that venue must be proper as to each \nparty is, of course, simply a default rule.  Congress is \nfree to adopt a different approach in a particular stat-\nute.  Congress has thus enacted special venue statutes \nthat authorize suit where \u201cany party resides,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \n44309(d)(1); where \u201cany plaintiff resides,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n2334(a); where \u201cany defendant resides,\u201d 43 U.S.C. \n1349(b)(1); where \u201ca defendant in the action resides,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 1391(e)(1)(A); or where \u201cany one defendant can \nbe found,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3732(a).  It has also provided that, \nin certain cases, a \u201cjoinder of  * * *  a defendant shall be \ndisregarded in determining where the action may be \nbrought with respect to the other defendants.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1391(c)(3).   \nThe statute at issue here, however, does not allow an \nadversely affected person to seek judicial review in a \ncircuit where \u201cany petitioner\u201d resides.  Nor does it state \n\n34 \n \nthat a joinder may be disregarded in analyzing venue.  \nTo the contrary, by authorizing an adversely affected \nperson to sue in the circuit where \u201csuch person resides \nor has their principal place of business,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1), the Act makes clear that a person may seek \nreview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) only if \nthat person is based in the circuit.  See pp. 28-29, supra.   \nC. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Interpretation Effectively Nullifies \nThe Act\u2019s Restrictions On Venue \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors\u2014allowing retailers to sue \nand requiring venue to be proper as to only one party\u2014\ncombine to produce a result that defies elementary \nprinciples of statutory interpretation.  A court should \nread a statute \u201cso that effect is given to all provisions, \nso that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void \nor insignificant.\u201d  Ysleta del sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 \nU.S. 685, 698-699 (2022) (citation omitted).  Courts \nshould avoid readings that would facilitate a statute\u2019s \n\u201cevasion\u201d or would enable parties \u201cto elude its provi-\nsions in the most easy manner.\u201d  The Emily, 9 Wheat. \n381, 389-390 (1824); see Scalia & Garner 63.   \nThose principles apply to venue statutes no less than \nto other statutes.  This Court has resisted reading \nvenue statutes in a way that would, in practice, \u201cgive the \nplaintiff an unrestrained choice of venues.\u201d  Leroy, 443 \nU.S. at 186-187 & n.23.  The Court has likewise avoided \ninterpretations that would \u201cencourage gamesmanship\u201d \nor \u201c\u200a\u2018create or multiply opportunities for forum shop-\nping.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. United \nStates District Court, 571 U.S. 49, 65 (2013) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, \n447 (2004) (rejecting interpretation that would allow \n\u201crampant forum shopping\u201d). \n\n35 \n \nContrary to those fundamental principles, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach drains the Act\u2019s venue restrictions of \nmeaning, facilitates their ready circumvention, and in-\nvites unchecked forum shopping.  Even though the Act \nspecifies only three venues where a person may seek ju-\ndicial review, see 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1), the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading allows an applicant to seek review in any \nregional circuit through the simple expedient of enlist-\ning a local retailer that is interested in selling (or a local \nconsumer who is interested in using) its products.  This \nCourt should not lightly conclude that Congress en-\nacted such a \u201cself-defeating statute.\u201d  Pugin v. Gar-\nland, 599 U.S. 600, 607 (2023) (citation omitted); see Cit-\nizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 20 \n(1995) (\u201cIt is an elementary rule of construction that \n\u2018the act cannot be held to destroy itself.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation undermines the \nAct\u2019s venue framework in additional ways.  By author-\nizing each adversely affected person to seek judicial re-\nview in that person\u2019s home circuit, the Act spreads out \nthe work of reviewing denial orders across all the re-\ngional circuits.  That is no small matter given the vol-\nume of work involved; FDA has received more than 27 \nmillion applications for marketing authorization since \n2024.  See Testimony of Brian A. King, Dir., Center for \nTobacco Products, FDA, Evaluating FDA Human \nFoods and Tobacco Programs (Sept. 10, 2024).  Under \nthe decision below, however, applicants throughout the \ncountry\u2014indeed, throughout the world\u2014could all head \nto a single circuit for judicial review.  That concern is \nnot hypothetical; as discussed above, applicants from \nChina, California, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, \nOhio, and Washington have all flocked to the Fifth Cir-\n\n36 \n \ncuit.  See pp. 10-11, supra.  That result thwarts Con-\ngress\u2019s effort to allocate cases among the circuits in an \norderly and sensible way.  Cf. Pet. Br. at 15, TC Heart-\nland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. \n258 (2017) (No. 16-341) (noting that plaintiffs had ex-\nploited an expansive reading of the patent venue statute \n\u2014which this Court ultimately reversed\u2014to file roughly \n40% of the Nation\u2019s patent cases in a single district).  \nThe Act, moreover, designates the D.C. Circuit as \nthe sole circuit where a person may seek judicial review \nregardless of residence or principal place of business.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  That provision reflects the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201cunique character\u201d as a \u201cnational court\u201d \nwith \u201cspecial responsibility to review legal challenges to \nthe conduct of the national government,\u201d irrespective of \nwhere the challenger lives.  John G. Roberts, Jr., What \nMakes the D.C. Circuit Different? A Historical View, \n92 Va. L. Rev. 375, 389 (2006).  Yet the decision below \nwould transform every regional court of appeals into  \nanother national court.  It would allow every circuit to \nhear cases brought there by manufacturers from \naround the country (and the world), defeating Con-\ngress\u2019s decision to vest such nationwide responsibility \nin the D.C. Circuit alone. \nIf Congress had meant to allow an applicant to seek \njudicial review in any circuit, it would have said so.  \nSome federal statutes authorize suit in \u201cany United \nStates district court,\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1640(e), or \u201cany United \nStates Court of Appeals,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 7482(b)(2).  The To-\nbacco Control Act, however, contains no such provision.  \nThe Fifth Circuit nonetheless held that an applicant \nmay file a petition for review anywhere in the country, \nso long as it can find a local retailer willing to join its \npetition.  But the court \u201coffered no reason for Congress \n\n37 \n \nto have constructed such an obscure path to such a sim-\nple result.\u201d  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 52 (2012). \nThe potential consequences of the court of appeals\u2019 \napproach extend beyond the Tobacco Control Act.  Many \nfederal statutes authorize an adversely affected or ag-\ngrieved person to challenge an agency order in the D.C. \nCircuit or the circuit where the person is based.3  But \nthe logic of the decision below would make it easy for \nchallengers to avoid those restrictions:  A challenger \nneed only (1) find someone who lives in the preferred \ncircuit and is indirectly affected by the order and \n(2) seek review alongside that person.   \nThe forum shopping invited by the decision below \nnot only violates the Act, but also harms the Judiciary.  \nWhen parties throughout the country deploy complex \nprocedural stratagems to channel their cases to a single \ncircuit, even when they have no meaningful ties to that \ncircuit, they erode the perception that judicial decisions \nrest on universally applicable rules of law.  This Court \nshould avoid that harm by correcting the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 erroneous interpretation of the Act\u2019s venue provi-\nsion.   \n \n3 See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 7123(a); 15 U.S.C. 77i(a), 80a\u201342(a), 80b\u201313(a), \n1710(a); 20 U.S.C. 6083(f\u200a)(5), 7973(e)(5); 21 U.S.C. 346a(h)(1), \n348(g)(1), 360g(a), 457(d), 607(e), 1036(b); 22 U.S.C. 6761(a)(5);  \n29 U.S.C. 160(f\u200a), 210(a), 660(a); 49 U.S.C. 5127(a), 47106(d)(3), \n47111(d)(3). \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C. Circuit.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS \nGeneral Counsel \nDepartment of Health and \nHuman Services \nMARK RAZA \nChief Counsel \nWENDY S.

or \n \n(B) \nany modification (including a change in \ndesign, any component, any part, or any constitu-\nent, including a smoke constituent, or in the con-\ntent, delivery or form of nicotine, or any other ad-\nditive or ingredient) of a tobacco product where \nthe modified product was commercially marketed \nin the United States after February 15, 2007. \n(2) Premarket review required \n \n(A) \nNew products \n \nAn order under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for a new \ntobacco product is required unless\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthe manufacturer has submitted a re-\nport under section 387e(\u200aj) of this title; and the \nSecretary has issued an order that the tobacco \nproduct\u2014 \n \n(I) \nis substantially equivalent to a to-\nbacco product commercially marketed (other \n\n2a \n \nthan for test marketing) in the United \nStates as of February 15, 2007; and \n \n(II) is in compliance with the require-\nments of this chapter; or \n \n(ii) \nthe tobacco product is exempt from \nthe requirements of section 387e(\u200aj) of this title \npursuant to a regulation issued under section \n387e(\u200aj)(3) of this title. \n \n(B) \nApplication to certain post-February 15, 2007, \nproducts \n \nSubparagraph (A) shall not apply to a tobacco \nproduct\u2014 \n \n(i) \nthat was first introduced or delivered \nfor introduction into interstate commerce for \ncommercial distribution in the United States \nafter February 15, 2007, and prior to the date \nthat is 21 months after June 22, 2009; and \n \n(ii) \nfor which a report was submitted un-\nder section 387e(\u200aj) of this title within such 21-\nmonth period, \nexcept that subparagraph (A) shall apply to the to-\nbacco product if the Secretary issues an order that \nthe tobacco product is not substantially equiva-\nlent. \n(3) Substantially equivalent defined \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nIn this section and section 387e(\u200aj) of this title, \nthe term \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d or \u201csubstan-\ntial equivalence\u201d means, with respect to the to-\nbacco product being compared to the predicate to-\n\n3a \n \nbacco product, that the Secretary by order has \nfound that the tobacco product\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas the same characteristics as the \npredicate tobacco product; or \n \n(ii) \nhas different characteristics and the \ninformation submitted contains information, \nincluding clinical data if deemed necessary by \nthe Secretary, that demonstrates that it is not \nappropriate to regulate the product under this \nsection because the product does not raise dif-\nferent questions of public health. \n \n(B) \nCharacteristics \n \nIn subparagraph (A), the term \u201ccharacteris-\ntics\u201d means the materials, ingredients, design, \ncomposition, heating source, or other features of a \ntobacco product. \n \n(C) \nLimitation \n \nA tobacco product may not be found to be sub-\nstantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco prod-\nuct that has been removed from the market at the \ninitiative of the Secretary or that has been deter-\nmined by a judicial order to be misbranded or \nadulterated. \n(4) Health information \n \n(A) \nSummary \n \nAs part of a submission under section 387e(\u200aj) of \nthis title respecting a tobacco product, the person \nrequired to file a premarket notification under \nsuch section shall provide an adequate summary \nof any health information related to the tobacco \n\n4a \n \nproduct or state that such information will be \nmade available upon request by any person. \n \n(B) \nRequired information \n \nAny summary under subparagraph (A) re-\nspecting a tobacco product shall contain detailed \ninformation regarding data concerning adverse \nhealth effects and shall be made available to the \npublic by the Secretary within 30 days of the issu-\nance of a determination that such tobacco product \nis substantially equivalent to another tobacco \nproduct. \n(b) \nApplication \n(1) Contents \n \nAn application under this section shall contain\u2014 \n \n(A) \nfull reports of all information, published \nor known to, or which should reasonably be known \nto, the applicant, concerning investigations which \nhave been made to show the health risks of such \ntobacco product and whether such tobacco prod-\nuct presents less risk than other tobacco products; \n \n(B) \na full statement of the components, in-\ngredients, additives, and properties, and of the \nprinciple or principles of operation, of such to-\nbacco product; \n \n(C) \na full description of the methods used in, \nand the facilities and controls used for, the manu-\nfacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing \nand installation of, such tobacco product; \n \n(D) \nan identifying reference to any tobacco \nproduct standard under section 387g of this title \n\n5a \n \nwhich would be applicable to any aspect of such \ntobacco product, and either adequate information \nto show that such aspect of such tobacco product \nfully meets such tobacco product standard or ade-\nquate information to justify any deviation from \nsuch standard; \n \n(E) \nsuch samples of such tobacco product and \nof components thereof as the Secretary may rea-\nsonably require; \n \n(F) \nspecimens of the labeling proposed to be \nused for such tobacco product; and \n \n(G) \nsuch other information relevant to the \nsubject matter of the application as the Secretary \nmay require. \n(2) Referral to Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory \nCommittee \n \nUpon receipt of an application meeting the re-\nquirements set forth in paragraph (1), the Secre-\ntary\u2014 \n \n \n(A) \nmay, on the Secretary\u2019s own initiative; or \n \n \n(B) \nmay, upon the request of an applicant, \nrefer such application to the Tobacco Products Scien-\ntific Advisory Committee for reference and for sub-\nmission (within such period as the Secretary may es-\ntablish) of a report and recommendation respecting \nthe application, together with all underlying data and \nthe reasons or basis for the recommendation. \n \n \n\n6a \n \n(c) \nAction on application \n(1) Deadline \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nAs promptly as possible, but in no event later \nthan 180 days after the receipt of an application \nunder subsection (b), the Secretary, after consid-\nering the report and recommendation submitted \nunder subsection (b)(2), shall\u2014 \n \n(i) \nissue an order that the new product \nmay be introduced or delivered for introduction \ninto interstate commerce if the Secretary finds \nthat none of the grounds specified in paragraph \n(2) of this subsection applies; or \n \n(ii) \nissue an order that the new product \nmay not be introduced or delivered for intro-\nduction into interstate commerce if the Secre-\ntary finds (and sets forth the basis for such \nfinding as part of or accompanying such denial) \nthat 1 or more grounds for denial specified in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection apply. \n \n(B) \nRestrictions on sale and distribution \n \nAn order under subparagraph (A)(i) may re-\nquire that the sale and distribution of the tobacco \nproduct be restricted but only to the extent that \nthe sale and distribution of a tobacco product may \nbe restricted under a regulation under section \n387f(d) of this title. \n(2) Denial of application \n \nThe Secretary shall deny an application submitted \nunder subsection (b) if, upon the basis of the infor-\n\n7a \n \nmation submitted to the Secretary as part of the ap-\nplication and any other information before the Secre-\ntary with respect to such tobacco product, the Secre-\ntary finds that\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthere is a lack of a showing that permit-\nting such tobacco product to be marketed would \nbe appropriate for the protection of the public \nhealth; \n \n(B) \nthe methods used in, or the facilities or \ncontrols used for, the manufacture, processing, or \npacking of such tobacco product do not conform to \nthe requirements of section 387f(e) of this title; \n \n(C) \nbased on a fair evaluation of all material \nfacts, the proposed labeling is false or misleading \nin any particular; or \n \n(D) \nsuch tobacco product is not shown to con-\nform in all respects to a tobacco product standard \nin effect under section 387g of this title, and there \nis a lack of adequate information to justify the de-\nviation from such standard. \n(3) Denial information \n \nAny denial of an application shall, insofar as the \nSecretary determines to be practicable, be accompa-\nnied by a statement informing the applicant of the \nmeasures required to remove such application from \ndeniable form (which measures may include further \nresearch by the applicant in accordance with 1 or \nmore protocols prescribed by the Secretary). \n(4) Basis for finding \n \nFor purposes of this section, the finding as to \nwhether the marketing of a tobacco product for which \n\n8a \n \nan application has been submitted is appropriate for \nthe protection of the public health shall be deter-\nmined with respect to the risks and benefits to the \npopulation as a whole, including users and nonusers \nof the tobacco product, and taking into account\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe increased or decreased likelihood \nthat existing users of tobacco products will stop \nusing such products; and \n \n(B) \nthe increased or decreased likelihood \nthat those who do not use tobacco products will \nstart using such products. \n(5) Basis for action \n \n(A) \nInvestigations \n \nFor purposes of paragraph (2)(A), whether per-\nmitting a tobacco product to be marketed would \nbe appropriate for the protection of the public \nhealth shall, when appropriate, be determined on \nthe basis of well-controlled investigations, which \nmay include 1 or more clinical investigations by \nexperts qualified by training and experience to \nevaluate the tobacco product. \n \n(B) \nOther evidence \n \nIf the Secretary determines that there exists \nvalid scientific evidence (other than evidence de-\nrived from investigations described in subpara-\ngraph (A)) which is sufficient to evaluate the to-\nbacco product, the Secretary may authorize that \nthe determination for purposes of paragraph \n(2)(A) be made on the basis of such evidence. \n \n \n\n9a \n \n(d) \nWithdrawal and temporary suspension \n(1) In general \n \nThe Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appro-\npriate, advice on scientific matters from the Tobacco \nProducts Scientific Advisory Committee, and after \ndue notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a \ntobacco product for which an order was issued under \nsubsection (c)(1)(A)(i), issue an order withdrawing \nthe order if the Secretary finds\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthat the continued marketing of such to-\nbacco product no longer is appropriate for the pro-\ntection of the public health; \n \n(B) \nthat the application contained or was ac-\ncompanied by an untrue statement of a material \nfact; \n \n(C) \nthat the applicant\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas failed to establish a system for \nmaintaining records, or has repeatedly or de-\nliberately failed to maintain records or to make \nreports, required by an applicable regulation \nunder section 387i of this title; \n \n(ii) \nhas refused to permit access to, or \ncopying or verification of, such records as re-\nquired by section 374 of this title; or \n \n(iii) \nhas not complied with the require-\nments of section 387e of this title; \n \n(D) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary with respect to such tobacco prod-\nuct, evaluated together with the evidence before \nthe Secretary when the application was reviewed, \n\n10a \n \nthat the methods used in, or the facilities and con-\ntrols used for, the manufacture, processing, pack-\ning, or installation of such tobacco product do not \nconform with the requirements of section 387f(e) \nof this title and were not brought into conformity \nwith such requirements within a reasonable time \nafter receipt of written notice from the Secretary \nof nonconformity; \n \n(E) \non the basis of new information before \nthe Secretary, evaluated together with the evi-\ndence before the Secretary when the application \nwas reviewed, that the labeling of such tobacco \nproduct, based on a fair evaluation of all material \nfacts, is false or misleading in any particular and \nwas not corrected within a reasonable time after \nreceipt of written notice from the Secretary of \nsuch fact;

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has undergone a significant contextual shift. While my knowledge of the parties' core legal arguments remains, the procedural posture of the case has advanced, fundamentally altering the weight and relevance of that information.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now as follows:\n\n*   **Core Legal Conflict (Stable):** The central dispute remains a clash between two interpretive methodologies.\n    *   **Respondents' Textualism:** R.J. Reynolds et al. argue for a plain-meaning interpretation of \"any person adversely affected\" in the Tobacco Control Act (TCA). Their case, as detailed in their Brief in Opposition (BIO), rests on the expansive meaning of \"any\" (*United States v. Gonzales*), dictionary definitions, and the direct legal jeopardy (risk of civil/criminal penalties) faced by retailers when an FDA marketing denial order (MDO) renders their products \"misbranded\" and \"adulterated.\"\n    *   **Petitioner's Structuralism:** The FDA advocates for a narrower, purpose-driven reading, arguing that the statutory scheme implicitly limits judicial review to the disappointed applicant-manufacturer to prevent forum shopping and maintain an orderly review process.\n\n*   **New, Overarching Procedural Fact (Major Update):** My previous analysis focused on the arguments presented at the certiorari stage, particularly the Respondents' strong procedural reasons for the Court to deny the petition (the appeal was interlocutory, there was no circuit split, and the FDA may have forfeited an argument). The new observation is the meta-realization that the Supreme Court *granted* certiorari. This is a dispositive fact that reshapes the entire predictive landscape.\n\n*   **Implications of the Certiorari Grant (Refined Understanding & Confidence Shift):** The Court's decision to hear the case, despite the procedural objections raised in the BIO, is a powerful signal.\n    1.  **Procedural Arguments are Moot for Merits Prediction:** The Respondents' arguments about the impropriety of an interlocutory appeal and the lack of a circuit split have failed to persuade the Court to deny review. While they were valid arguments for the cert stage, they now have zero predictive value for how the Court will rule on the substantive legal question. The battle has moved past that gate.\n    2.  **Substantive Importance is Elevated:** The Court's willingness to take the case without a circuit split strongly suggests it perceives a significant, pressing issue of federal administrative law. The FDA's concerns about forum shopping and the potential disruption to statutory review schemes across the government have evidently resonated with at least four justices. This brings the systemic implications, which were downplayed in the Respondents' BIO, back to the forefront as a likely motivator for the Court.\n    3.  **Perceived Strength of FDA's Position Increased:** The grant of certiorari is an implicit signal that the FDA's petition raised substantial doubts about the correctness of the Fifth Circuit's decision. The government's argument that only the applicant is \"adversely affected\" in the manner contemplated by the specific judicial review provision of the TCA is clearly viewed by the Court as a serious, meritorious claim that requires a definitive national answer.\n\n*   **Current State of Knowledge and Uncertainty:** I have a robust model of the Respondents' textualist defense, built from their BIO. However, I now recognize this model was based on a document with a specific, defensive purpose: to argue the case was unworthy of review. The Court disagreed. My understanding of the Petitioner's (FDA's) position, while conceptually clear, is based on inference and their initial petition. The single most critical piece of missing evidence is now the **Petitioner's Brief on the Merits**. This document will contain the government's full, affirmative case, detailing precisely why the Fifth Circuit's textualist reading is wrong and why the Court should adopt a narrower, structural interpretation. It is essential for understanding the arguments the Justices found compelling enough to grant review.",
