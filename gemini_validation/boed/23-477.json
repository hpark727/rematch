    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2023, Tennessee and Kentucky passed laws restricting certain medical treatments for transgender minors. These laws prohibited healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sex-transition surgeries to minors for the purpose of altering their appearance or validating their gender identity when inconsistent with their biological sex. Both laws included exceptions for certain medical conditions and provided mechanisms for enforcement, including professional discipline for healthcare providers and extended statutes of limitations for lawsuits.\n\nIn response, groups of transgender minors, their parents, and healthcare providers challenged these laws in federal court. The plaintiffs argued that the laws violated their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. They sought preliminary injunctions to prevent the laws from taking effect. In both cases, district courts initially granted injunctions, finding that the laws likely infringed on parents\u2019 fundamental rights to direct their children's medical care and discriminated based on sex. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed these injunctions, allowing the laws to go into effect pending further legal proceedings.",

This is a cornerstone of SCOTUS prediction and represents a generalizable and robust design pattern (Design EIG). The high Design EIG reflects the value of articulating a clear, logical, and efficient plan to tackle the problem.

Acquiring this document will cause a massive update to my belief state, moving me from near-total ignorance to a full understanding of one side of the legal battle. This is a foundational and non-negotiable step for forming a prediction. The Task EIG is 1.0 because it's hard to conceive of a single action that could provide more critical, task-specific information at this juncture. The Design EIG is also significant (0.6) because successfully executing this step validates a core tenet of my prediction strategy: that the primary briefs are the most crucial initial documents to analyze.

The beliefs are coherent and well-integrated, with no contradictions and a clear logical progression from uncertainty to targeted evidence gathering (0.8). Information density is moderate, as the agent provides some detail about the approach and sources but lacks substantive content or extensive detail (0.4).

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatients in appropriate cases.2  \n \n2 Those include (among others) the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospi-\ntal; the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital; the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hos-\npital in Columbus, Ohio; the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pitts-\nburgh; Duke Children\u2019s Hospital & Health Center; the Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia; Children\u2019s National Hospital in the \n \n\n7 \n \nB. Tennessee SB1 \n1. Puberty blockers have been used to treat gender \ndysphoria for 20 years and precocious puberty for more \nthan 30 years.  J.A. 964, 967.  And hormone therapy has \nbeen used even longer\u2014for at least 60 years to treat \ngender dysphoria in adults, and at least 20 years in ad-\nolescents.  See Pet. App. 2a, 5a, 265a. \nIn the last three years, however, state legislatures \nhave adopted a wave of bans on gender-affirming care \nfor minors based on model legislation and legislative \nfindings circulated by advocacy groups.  In 2021, Arkan-\nsas became the first state to enact a ban.  See Ark. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 20-9-1502(a).  In 2022, Alabama followed.  See \nAla. Code \u00a7 26-26-4.  And in the year and a half since, 20 \nother States have done the same.3   \n2. This case is about the ban Tennessee adopted in \nMarch 2023, the Prohibition on Medical Procedures \nPerformed on Minors Related to Sexual Identity, Sen-\nate Bill 1, Tenn.

See Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 58-1-\n603, 58-1-603.1; W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20.  See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B), 68-33-103(a)(1).5  \nSB1 defines \u201c[s]ex\u201d as the \u201cimmutable characteristics of \nthe reproductive system that define the individual as \nmale or female, as determined by anatomy and genetics \nexisting at the time of birth.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-102(9).  \nBecause SB1\u2019s prohibition applies only when a cov-\nered treatment is prescribed to allow individuals to live \nin conformity with a gender identity other than their \nsex assigned at birth, the law does not restrict the \n \n4 See, e.g., Tenn. Pub. Ch. 285 (enacted Apr. 28, 2023) (Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 49-50-805) (limiting students to participating in interscholas-\ntic athletic events \u201conly in accordance with the student\u2019s sex\u201d at \nbirth); Tenn. Pub. Ch. 448 (enacted May 17, 2023) (Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 49-6-5102) (specifying that public school teachers need not refer \nto a student by pronouns inconsistent with the student\u2019s sex as-\nsigned at birth). \n5  SB1 also prohibits surgical procedures provided for the same \npurposes, but that prohibition is not at issue here.

The law also explicitly exempts those treat-\nments when they are prescribed \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s con-\ngenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical \ninjury.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  The \nterms \u201c[c]ongenital defect\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d are defined to \ninclude an \u201cabnormality present in a minor that is in-\nconsistent with the normal development of a human be-\ning of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d but specifically exclude \u201cgender \ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, [and] gender in-\ncongruence.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(2).   \nViolations of SB1 are punishable by civil penalties of \n$25,000 for each prohibited treatment, professional dis-\ncipline, and potential civil liability in private suits.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-105 to 68-33-107.  The law took ef-\nfect on July 1, 2023. \nC. The Present Controversy \n1. Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and, after \nexpedited briefing, reversed the preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 1a-101a; see id. at 102a-124a (stay opinion).6   \na. As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit rejected pri-\nvate plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim.  Pet. App. 30a-\n50a.  The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.  The plaintiffs in that case have also sought certiorari.  \nSee Doe 1 v.

But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb. Judge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  Under SB1, \nJudge White emphasized, \u201cmedical procedures that are \npermitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.\u201d  Id. at 72a (citation omitted).  And \nJudge White explained that SB1 \u201ccondition[s] the avail-\nability of procedures on a minor\u2019s conformity with soci-\netal expectations associated with the minor\u2019s assigned \nsex\u201d by \u201cbar[ring] treatment when sought \u2018for the pur-\npose of\u200a\u2019 inducing physiological changes, like secondary \nsex characteristics, that are \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 how so-\nciety expects boys and girls to appear.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)).   \n \nJudge White concluded that SB1 cannot withstand \nheightened scrutiny because its \u201ctext[] effectively re-\nveal[s] that [its] purpose is to force boys and girls to \nlook and live like boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L. Stutzman, Long-term use of antidepressants, mood \nstabilizers, and antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a focus on \nappropriate deprescribing, 11 Mental Health Clinician 320, 329-330 \n(2021). \n12 See, e.g., Ankita Nanda et al., Adverse Effects of Stimulant In-\nterventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): \nA Comprehensive Systematic Review, 15 Cureus, no. 9, at 9 (Sept. \n2023); Natalia M.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My prior belief state had evolved from a complete lack of knowledge to a focused strategy of analyzing the petitioner's and respondent's briefs on the merits to understand the core Equal Protection arguments. I had identified these documents as the primary sources of evidence for my prediction but had not yet analyzed their contents.\n\nThis new observation provides the substantive legal arguments from the Petitioner, the United States, fundamentally advancing my understanding of the case. My beliefs have now been updated with the specific legal framework and factual claims the U.S. will use to argue that Tennessee's law is unconstitutional.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Confirmation of the Core Legal Question:** The brief confirms the central issue is whether Tennessee's Senate Bill 1 (SB1) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by categorically prohibiting specific medical treatments for transgender minors.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Primary Legal Argument (Sex Discrimination):** The United States' primary argument is that SB1 constitutes sex discrimination and must be reviewed under heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **Mechanism of Discrimination:** The law is discriminatory on its face because it determines the legality of a medical treatment based on the patient's sex. For example, a doctor can prescribe testosterone to a minor assigned male at birth to treat delayed puberty but is prohibited from prescribing the same medication to a minor assigned female at birth for the purpose of gender transition. This is a direct, sex-based classification.\n    *   **Key Precedents:** The U.S. heavily relies on precedents like *Bostock v. Clayton County* (which found discrimination against transgender people is a form of sex discrimination under Title VII), *United States v. Virginia (VMI)*, and *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* to argue that laws drawing distinctions based on sex are inherently suspect.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Secondary Legal Argument (Transgender Status Discrimination):** As an alternative path to heightened scrutiny, the U.S. argues that SB1 discriminates against transgender individuals as a class. This argument draws parallels to cases like *City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc.*, suggesting that laws targeting a politically powerless and historically disadvantaged group warrant more exacting judicial review.\n\n4.  **Argument that SB1 Fails Heightened Scrutiny:** The U.S. argues that even if Tennessee has an important interest, the law is not substantially related to achieving it.\n    *   **Illegitimate State Interest:** The brief attacks the state's professed interest in \"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\" as an impermissible goal of enforcing sex stereotypes, citing cases like *Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan*.\n    *   **Poor Legislative Fit (Underinclusive and Overinclusive):** The law is described as poorly tailored.\n        *   **Underinclusive:** It bans puberty blockers and hormones for gender dysphoria but permits them, and other even riskier procedures (e.g., bariatric surgery, certain uses of growth hormone), for other conditions affecting minors. This undermines the state's claim that its primary interest is protecting children from harm.\n        *   **Overinclusive:** It imposes a categorical ban, preventing doctors, patients, and parents from making individualized medical decisions, even when the care is deemed necessary and appropriate according to established medical standards.\n\n5.  **Factual Basis for Petitioner's Claims:** The U.S. grounds its legal arguments in a specific set of facts:\n    *   **Medical Consensus:** Major medical organizations (American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Endocrine Society, etc.) recognize gender-affirming care as the evidence-based standard of care for treating gender dysphoria.\n    *   **Seriousness of Gender Dysphoria:** The condition is presented as a serious medical issue that, if untreated, leads to severe negative health outcomes, including depression, self-harm, and suicide.\n    *   **Benefits vs. Risks:** The brief asserts that the medical benefits of the banned treatments are substantial and that Tennessee has both overstated the risks and ignored the benefits.\n\nMy predictive model is now significantly more refined. The case outcome will likely turn on whether the Supreme Court accepts the petitioner's argument that this is a case about sex discrimination subject to heightened scrutiny. If the Court agrees, the law is unlikely to survive. If the Court rejects this framing and applies rational basis review (as the Sixth Circuit did), the law is much more likely to be upheld. My uncertainty now centers on how the Court will apply precedents like *Bostock* to the Equal Protection Clause. The next essential piece of evidence is the respondent's brief, which will reveal Tennessee's counterarguments to this framework.",

Successfully retrieving this brief will cause a maximal update to my belief state, moving my understanding from a one-sided analysis to a comprehensive view of the core legal conflict. Therefore, the Task EIG is 1.0, as no other single action could provide more critical information at this stage. The Design EIG is also significant (0.6) because this action validates a fundamental and highly generalizable strategy for legal prediction: once the petitioner's main arguments are understood, the next highest-value step is to acquire the respondent's primary counter-arguments.

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for mi\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for minors under 16.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.   \nIn recent years, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered gender transitioning in mi-\nnors reversed course.  Pet. App. 28a.  Health authori-\nties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the United \nKingdom have all concluded that these interventions \npose significant risks with unproven benefits:   \n\n8 \n \n\uf0b7 Sweden: Sweden\u2019s Board of Health and Wel-\nfare found that \u201cthe evidence on treatment effi-\ncacy and safety is still insufficient and inconclu-\nsive\u201d and that \u201cthe risks\u201d of puberty blockers \nand cross-sex hormones \u201ccurrently outweigh \nthe possible benefits.\u201d  J.A. 337-40, 715-29.   \n\uf0b7 Finland: Finland\u2019s Council for Choices in \nHealth Care found that \u201cgender reassignment \nof minors is an experimental practice\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he reliability of the existing studies\u201d is \n\u201chighly uncertain.\u201d  J.A. 583-84.  \n\uf0b7 Norway:  The Norwegian Healthcare Investi-\ngation Board concluded that the \u201cresearch-\nbased knowledge for gender-affirming treat-\nment (hormonal and surgical) ... is insufficient,\u201d \nespecially for \u201cthe teenage population.\u201d J.A. \n341-42.   \n\uf0b7 United Kingdom: The United Kingdom\u2019s \nlauded independent review found \u201cremarkably \nweak evidence\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions, emphasizing that the benefits of using \n\u201cpuberty blockers and masculinizing/feminizing \nhormones in adolescents are unproven.\u201d  Inde-\npendent Review of Gender Identity Services for \nChildren and Young People: Final Report 13, \n33, 194 (April 2024) (Cass Review); J.A. 333-35, \n364-68.    \nAcross these reviews, authorities confronted the \n\u201csuggest[ion] that hormone treatment reduces the ele-\nvated risk of death by suicide\u201d in transgender-identi-\n\n9 \n \nfying youth; as the Cass Review emphasized, \u201cthe evi-\ndence found did not support this conclusion.\u201d  Cass Re-\nview at 33; see also J.A. 660-75.  Based on the available \nevidence, these countries now consider medical gen-\nder-transition interventions experimental in minors \nand have effectively banned them outside of controlled \nresearch settings. J.A. 332-42, 409-11, 726-27. \nUndeterred, advocacy groups have doubled down \non aggressive interventions for minors.  WPATH\u2014the \n\u201cleading association,\u201d U.S. Br. 3\u2014crafted the most re-\ncent version of its guidelines \u201cto have serious effect in \nthe law and policy ... even if the wording isn\u2019t quite \ncorrect,\u201d Ex. 184 at 24, Boe v. Marshall, 2:22-cv-184 \n(M.D. Ala.), Doc. 560-34.  And indeed, \u201cideology, not \nscience\u201d drove WPATH\u2019s drafting process.  Eknes-\nTucker v. Governor of Alabama, 114 F.4th 1241, 1261 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (Lagoa, J., concurring in the denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nWPATH initially commissioned a Johns Hopkins-\nled review to provide evidence-based backing for the \nGuidelines.  But it \u201cabandoned\u201d that approach after \nthe review \u201cfound little to no evidence about children \nand adolescents\u201d benefitting from gender-transition \ninterventions.  Boe, Doc. 560-23 at 22-23; J.A. 375-76.  \nAs one contributor put it, \u201c[o]ur concerns, echoed by \nthe social justice lawyers we spoke with, is that evi-\ndence-based review reveals little or no evidence and \nputs us in an untenable position in terms of affecting \npolicy or winning lawsuits.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th \nat 1261 (Lagoa, J., concurring) (quoting Boe, Doc. 560-\n24 at 2).  Instead, the Guidelines purport to rely on a \n\u201cconsensus-based\u201d process that incorporates opinions \n\n10 \n \napproved by 75% of committee members.  WPATH-8 \nat S8, S247.  WPATH\u2019s \u201cconsensus\u201d process left the \ndoor open for prioritizing politics over science.  And \nthat is exactly what happened.   \nFederal officials intervened in the Guidelines\u2019 \ndrafting.  HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel \nLevine pressured WPATH to issue the Guidelines be-\ncause its \u201cfailure\u201d to do so was \u201cproving a barrier to \noptimal policy progress.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-34 at 54.  \nThen, after receiving a preview of the near-final \nGuidelines, Levine\u2019s staff asked WPATH to remove \nthe recommended age minimums because the \u201clistings \nof ages [would] result in devastating legislation for \ntrans care.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-36 at 28-29.  On a later \nZoom call, Levine conveyed that \u201cthe Biden admin-\nistration\u201d worried about the inclusion of age limits for \npolitical reasons and \u201casked [WPATH] to remove \nthem.\u201d  Id. at 11.  \nWPATH members questioned the \u201cethic[s]\u201d of \u201cal-\nlowing US politics to dictate\u201d the Guidelines.  Id. at 32.  \nThey \u201cexplained to\u201d Levine that WPATH \u201ccould not \njust remove\u201d all age minimums \u201cat this stage.\u201d  Id. at \n11.  After all, the \u201cexpert opinion\u201d that called for those \nlimits was the Guidelines\u2019 \u201conly evidence.\u201d  Id. at 57. \nBut the reality that the drafters\u2019 \u201cexpert opinion\u201d \n\u201cwould be influenced by politics\u201d soon set in.  Id. at 32-\n33.  The dam broke when the American Academy of \nPediatrics (AAP) indicated it would oppose the Guide-\nlines if any age minimums were included.  Boe, Doc. \n560-37 at 100-01.  One co-chair objected that accepting \nAAP\u2019s request would \u201cmake a joke of our methodol-\nogy.\u201d  Id. at 101.    \n\n11 \n \nWPATH caved anyway.  Within days of the Guide-\nlines\u2019 release, it abandoned all age minimums.  No-\nwhere do the Guidelines disclose WPATH\u2019s eleventh-\nhour departure from the \u201cconsensus-based\u201d process it \nnow touts.  WPATH-8 at S8.   \nC. Troubling Disclosures in Tennessee \nPrompt SB1. \nAround the same time, media reports disclosed \nthat Vanderbilt University Medical Center was \nproviding gender-transition procedures to minors.  \nJ.A. 161-64.  Some patients \u201cstarted gender-affirming \nhormones at 13 or 14.\u201d  Ex. 1-B, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video \nat 45:41-45:45).  Others received \u201ctop surgery\u201d\u2014i.e., \nmastectomies.  J.A. 181.  Recordings revealed one doc-\ntor stating that \u201ctop surgeries\u201d and \u201croutine hormone \ntreatment\u201d would \u201cmake a lot of money\u201d for the hospi-\ntal. Ex. 1-D, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:11-0:47). \nYet, by Vanderbilt physicians\u2019 own admissions, \nthey \u201cha[d] very, very little data to guide [the] treat-\nment\u201d and were \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Ex.1-G, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 37:29-37:32); J.A. 231.  Van-\nderbilt\u2019s gender-clinic director presented a seminar ti-\ntled \u201cCaring for the Transgender Patient: With little \nevidence, but a lot of love.\u201d  Ex. 1-H, D.Ct.Doc.113-1, \nPageID#1060.  She noted the absence of \u201creal consen-\nsus\u201d about appropriate cross-sex hormone levels.  J.A. \n231.  And she conceded that doctors \u201cha[d]n\u2019t been do-\ning this ... long enough to know the long-term effects\u201d \nof cross-sex hormones, \u201cparticularly ... in [the] pediat-\nric population.\u201d Ex.1-G, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at \n38:08-38:20).  Still, Vanderbilt broadly offered these \n\n12 \n \nprocedures to youth.  And it warned potential \u201cconsci-\nentious\u201d objectors, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t want to do this kind \nof \nwork, \ndon\u2019t \nwork \nat \nVanderbilt.\u201d \nEx.1-E, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:01-0:08, 1:10-1:14). \nFollowing these revelations and tracking Euro-\npean developments, a bipartisan coalition of Tennes-\nsee lawmakers passed SB1 to \u201cprotect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  \nThe legislature acknowledged gender dysphoria as a \ncondition involving \u201cdistress from a discordance be-\ntween\u201d a person\u2019s sex and asserted gender identity.  \nId. \u00a768-33-101(c).  But it detailed concerns with using \npharmaceutical and surgical interventions to address \nthis condition in minors. \nSpecifically, SB1\u2019s legislative findings recognized \nthat gender-transition interventions \u201ccan lead to [a] \nminor becoming irreversibly sterile, having increased \nrisk of disease and illness, or suffering adverse and \nsometimes fatal psychological consequences.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-\n33-101(b).  The law further observed that the harms \nassociated with these interventions \u201care [not] yet fully \nknown.\u201d  Id.  And it noted that \u201chealth authorities in \nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom \u2026 have \nfound no evidence that the benefits of these proce-\ndures outweigh the risks.\u201d Id. \u00a768-33-101(e).  At the \nsame time, the legislature found that \u201cminors lack the \nmaturity to fully understand and appreciate the life-\naltering consequences of such procedures.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n101(h).  SB1 drew attention to the \u201cmany individuals \n... express[ing] regret for medical procedures that were \nperformed ... on them ... when they were minors.\u201d  Id.  \nIndeed, the legislature heard from a detransitioner \n\n13 \n \nwho explained that she was not \u201ccapable of making in-\nformed lifelong decisions\u201d as a teenager, and yet doc-\ntors provided transition treatments that severely \ndamaged her body.  House Health Subcommittee (Jan. \n31, 2023), tinyurl.com/5n8ewdsv (59:15-1:02:22). \nSB1 regulates medical practice to address these \nconcerns.  It prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming certain \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, \nor live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the \nminor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or dis-\ntress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and \nasserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  \nRegulated procedures include \u201c[s]urgically removing, \nmodifying, altering, or entering into tissues, cavities, \nor organs\u201d and \u201c[p]rescribing, administering, or dis-\npensing any puberty blocker or hormone.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n102(5).  SB1 allows these procedures to treat different \nconditions, like congenital defects, precocious puberty, \ndisease, and physical injuries. Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  \nAnd it leaves other long-used treatments, such as psy-\nchotherapy, available to minors.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(c). \nD. The District Court Preliminarily Enjoins \nSB1, but the Sixth Circuit Reverses. \nThree minors, their parents, and a doctor brought \na pre-enforcement challenge to SB1, asserting sub-\nstantive-due-process and equal-protection theories.  \nThe federal government intervened.  Then, days be-\nfore SB1\u2019s effective date, the district court held the law \nfacially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined \nall but the surgical prohibition.  Pet. App. 130a-218a, \n\n14 \n \n219a-221a.  The Sixth Circuit stayed that injunction. \nPet. App. 102a-124a. \nThe Sixth Circuit then reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n101a.  On the equal-protection claim, Chief Judge Sut-\nton, joined by Judge Thapar, concluded that SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions do not \u201cturn[] on sex\u201d or impose a sex classi-\nfication.  Pet. App. 32a.  Rather, SB1\u2019s \u201cclassifications \nturn on presumptively valid age and medical condi-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.   And in imposing those re-\nstrictions, SB1 \u201ctreat[s] similarly situated individuals \nevenhandedly.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a.  Given SB1\u2019s presump-\ntively valid restrictions, the court held that the law \n\u201cdoes not trigger\u201d heightened review.  Pet. App. 33a.  \nApplying heightened scrutiny, the court recognized, \nwould transfer \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d and \u201cfraught \nline-drawing dilemmas\u201d from the \u201carena of public de-\nbate and legislative action\u201d to the unelected federal ju-\ndiciary.  Pet. App. 44a-45a.  That the government \u201cdis-\nagree[s] with the States\u2019 assessment of the risks and \nthe right response to those risks ... does not suffice to \ninvalidate a democratically enacted law.\u201d  Pet. App. \n50a.   \nJudge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  She \nconcluded that intermediate scrutiny applies and that \nSB1 fails that standard, largely based on her assess-\nment of the interventions\u2019 risks and efficacy.  Pet. App. \n59a, 85a-87a. \n \n \n\n15 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  Through SB1, Tennessee lawfully exercised its \npower to regulate medicine by protecting minors from \nrisky, unproven gender-transition interventions.  It is \nnot unconstitutional discrimination to say that drugs \ncan be prescribed for one reason but not another.  \nWeighing risks and benefits, States (and the federal \ngovernment) draw age- and use-based distinctions for \ndrugs all the time.   \nII. SB1 contains no sex classification that war-\nrants heightened review.  It creates two groups:  mi-\nnors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors \nseeking drugs for other medical purposes.  Each of \nthese groups \u201cincludes members of both sexes,\u201d so no \nfacial sex classification exists.  Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 \nU.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974).  Not every law that men-\ntions sex classifies based on sex.   \nThe government\u2019s newfound focus on \u201cgender con-\nformity\u201d flouts law and fact.  Repeatedly claiming that \nSB1 requires conformity does not create a sex-based \nline, and the Equal Protection Clause confers no sub-\nstantive right to non-conforming behavior.  SB1\u2019s risk-\nbenefit assessment of gender-transition interventions \ndoes not push conformity ends anyway.   \nHeightened review also does not apply because \nboys and girls are not similarly situated for purposes \nof SB1.  It defies biological reality to suggest, as the \ngovernment does, that males and females are medi-\ncally the same for purposes of receiving testosterone \nand estrogen. \n\n16 \n \nPivoting, the government seeks to overhaul this \nCourt\u2019s established equal-protection framework by \nconstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test.  Decades \nof precedent foreclose that maneuver.  Importing a \nbut-for approach to identify classifications under the \nConstitution would jettison longstanding limits on dis-\nparate-impact liability, drastically expand the appli-\ncation of heightened review, and clash with other legal \nprotections.  This Court should reject the govern-\nment\u2019s Bostock premise and the resulting doctrinal \nfallout.   \nA doctrinal sea change would be for naught be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  For \npuberty blockers, changing sex changes nothing since \nboth males and females take the same drug; medical \npurpose alone dictates the availability of the drug un-\nder SB1.  And for cross-sex hormones, the government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to reach a \ndifferent outcome.  \nIII. The challengers\u2019 transgender-discrimination \nargument does not justify heightened review.  SB1 \ndoes not classify based on transgender status.  And \neven if it did, this Court should not get back in the \nfraught \nbusiness \nof \ncreating \nsuspect \nclasses.  \nTransgender status does not uniquely warrant ex-\npanding the list of quasi-suspect classifications for the \nfirst time in nearly 50 years. \nIV.  Though rational-basis review applies, SB1 \nreadily satisfies intermediate scrutiny too.  The law \n\u201csubstantially relate[s]\u201d to Tennessee\u2019s undisputedly \n\n17 \n \ncompelling interests.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 68 \n(2001).  Even under heightened review, this Court de-\nfers to legislative factfinding and gives States \u201cwide \ndiscretion to pass legislation in areas where there is \nmedical and scientific uncertainty.\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.  That discretion makes this case easy: SB1 \ncontains specific findings and imposes restrictions in \nan area of medical uncertainty.   \nThe government convinced the district court to \nweigh the risks and benefits itself with no deference to \nlegislative findings.  That is not the proper legal stand-\nard or the judiciary\u2019s role.  Nor should this Court credit \nthe government\u2019s claim of \u201cmedical consensus\u201d given \nits credibility killing silence on the European health \nauthorities that SB1 itself references.  The govern-\nment\u2019s one-sided telling of the evidence misreports the \nmedical landscape.  And its over- and under-inclusiv-\nity arguments both ignore medical reality and fail to \nrebut SB1\u2019s substantial relation to Tennessee\u2019s com-\npelling interests. \nThe Court should affirm. \n \n \n\n18 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State \nfrom \u201cdeny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws.\u201d  That language \u201cwas \nnot designed to compel uniformity in the face of differ-\nence,\u201d Whitney v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, 309 U.S. 530, 542 \n(1940), or to \u201cforbid classifications\u201d entirely, Nord-\nlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992).  Rather, it \u201ckeeps \ngovernmental decisionmakers from treating differ-\nently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\u201d  \nId.  \nTo make out an equal-protection claim, a plaintiff \nmust first identify the classifications drawn by the \nchallenged action. A law contains a facial classifica-\ntion only when it \u201cdistinguish[es] between individu-\nals\u201d based on a particular characteristic.  Shaw v. \nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993).  For legislation \u201cneu-\ntral on its face,\u201d a plaintiff must show that a law dis-\nparately impacts a particular group and prove that the \nlegislature acted with \u201cdiscriminatory intent or pur-\npose.\u201d  Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. \nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977). \n\u201cWhen those who appear similarly situated are ... \ntreated differently,\u201d this Court looks to the govern-\nment\u2019s basis for the differential treatment.  Engquist \nv. Oregon Dep\u2019t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 602 (2008).  It \napplies strict scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na suspect class (race, alienage, or national origin) and \nintermediate scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na quasi-suspect class (sex or illegitimacy).  City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440-41 \n(1985).  Otherwise, \u201clegislation is presumed to be valid \n\n19 \n \nand will be sustained if the classification drawn by the \nstatute is rationally related to a legitimate state inter-\nest.\u201d  Id. at 440. \nThose principles compel upholding SB1.  The law \nregulates the practice of medicine by placing age- and \nuse-based restrictions on medical procedures.  It does \nnot classify based on any protected characteristic.  \nAnd SB1\u2019s approach satisfies intermediate scrutiny \nregardless. \nI. \nSB1 Sets Age- and Use-Based Limits on \nMedical Procedures  \nStates exercise broad power over \u201chealth and \nsafety matters.\u201d  Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated \nMed. Lab\u2019ys, 471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985).  This power in-\ncludes \u201cregulat[ing] the practice of medicine.\u201d  \nMcNaughton v. Johnson, 242 U.S. 344, 348-49 (1917).  \nIndeed, \u201c[t]here is perhaps no profession more \nproperly open to \u2026 regulation\u201d by States.  Watson v. \nMaryland, 218 U.S. 173, 176 (1910).     \nStates routinely exercise their public-health au-\nthority by regulating \u201cmedical treatments for adults \nand children.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  They prohibit or se-\nverely restrict irreversible practices like assisted sui-\ncide and euthanasia, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 719 (1997); Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 797 \n(1997), \u201cintrusive and possibly hazardous\u201d measures \nlike \u201cpsychosurgery and shock treatment,\u201d Aden v. \nYounger, 57 Cal. App. 3d 662, 668, 673 (1976), and the \ngood-faith \u201cadministration, sale, prescription, and use \nof dangerous ... drugs,\u201d Minnesota ex rel. Whipple v. \nMartinson, 256 U.S. 41, 45 (1921).  States\u2019 power over \n\n20 \n \npermissible medical practices is \u201cso manifest\u201d and \n\u201cfirmly established\u201d that it cannot \u201cbe successfully \ncalled in question.\u201d  Id. \nTennessee exercised this power when it passed \nSB1.  That law prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming specific \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either (1) \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify \nwith, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or (2) \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort \nor distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex \nand asserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n103(a)(1). And it allows these \u201cprocedures\u201d for other \nmedical uses.  Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).    \nSB1 expressly draws an age-based line between \nadults and minors.  That type of \u201cdistinguishing\u201d is \n\u201cnot unusual\u201d in medicine or the law generally.  Pet. \nApp. 31a; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a762-38-211(a) (tattoos); \nid. \u00a7\u00a736-3-105, -106 (marriage); W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a716-\n11-1 (sterilization).  And \u201cage is not a suspect classifi-\ncation.\u201d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470 (1991).   \nSB1 further distinguishes between the medical \npurpose for using certain \u201cmedical procedure[s].\u201d  It \nbars certain procedures\u2014surgery, puberty blockers, \nand cross-sex hormones\u2014\u201cfor the purpose of\u201d gender \ntransition.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  But it \nlets physicians use those surgeries and drugs to ad-\ndress distinct medical conditions\u2014e.g., precocious pu-\nberty, congenital defects, disease, and trauma.  Id. \n\u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  Put otherwise, SB1 separates the \nuse of certain surgeries and drugs to facilitate gender \ntransition from their use for different medical reasons.  \n\n21 \n \nEknes-Tucker v. Governor of Alabama, 80 F.4th 1205, \n1233 (11th Cir. 2023) (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nSound medical practice depends on such distinc-\ntions.  A procedure\u2019s risks cannot be isolated from its \nreason for use, since the medical purpose informs the \nrisk-reward calculus.  That is why FDA approves \ndrugs\u2014including those at issue here\u2014only for specific \nlabeled \u201cuse[s].\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7355(b)(1), (d); Benefit-Risk \nAssessment in Drug Regulatory Decision-Making, FDA \n(Mar. 30, 2018), https://tinyurl.com/4xzcw9br.  And it \nis why States frequently impose use-driven re-\nstrictions in medicine.  Doctors can use morphine to \ntreat a patient\u2019s pain but not to assist a patient\u2019s sui-\ncide.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-13-216; see Vacco, 521 U.S. \nat 808-09.  Doctors can perform pelvic surgery on \nwomen who have \u201cgiven birth\u201d but not on women being \nsubjected to ritualistic genital mutilation.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a739-13-110.  Doctors can perform an abortion to \naddress risks to a mother\u2019s life or health but not for \nelective purposes, in many States.  Id. \u00a739-15-213.  \nDoctors can prescribe testosterone to address hormo-\nnal imbalance but not to \u201cincrease muscle mass, \nstrength or weight without medical necessity.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a739-17-430(a)(2).  The list goes on.   \nA State may \u201creasonably\u201d deem a procedure \u201csafe \nwhen used for one purpose but risky when used for an-\nother, especially when\u201d the procedure \u201cis being put to \na relatively new use.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  Tennessee \ndid just that:  The legislature determined that the \ncost-benefit calculus warranted permitting the surger-\nies and drugs subject to SB1 for some reasons and not \n\n22 \n \nothers. That is not discrimination.  It is an even-\nhanded \u201cregulation of a medical procedure\u201d that turns \non the reason for the procedure\u2019s use.  Dobbs v. Jack-\nson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236 (2022); \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1227.   \nII. SB1 Contains No Sex Classification that \nWarrants Heightened Scrutiny \nA. SB1 does not classify based on sex. \nThe government cannot point to a sex classifica-\ntion under the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork.  And its \u201cgender conformity\u201d argument cannot \nsalvage that failure.  The Sixth Circuit correctly held \nthat SB1 turns on age and use\u2014not sex.   \n1. SB1 draws no sex-based line.  \nFacial sex classification occurs when a law \u201cdistin-\nguish[es] between individuals\u201d based on sex.  Shaw, \n509 U.S. at 642.  A university excludes \u201cwomen.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 520 (1996).  A \nState imposes different rules for \u201cmales\u201d versus \u201cfe-\nmales.\u201d  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192 (1976).  A \nlaw provides that \u201cmales must be preferred to females\u201d \nfor the handling of property.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. \n71, 73 (1971).  These are \u201cclassic sex classification[s].\u201d \nL.W. Br. 18.     \nTennessee\u2019s law draws no similar \u201csex-based \nline[].\u201d  U.S. Br. 19.   SB1 does not \u201cprefer one sex over \nthe other,\u201d \u201cinclude one sex and exclude the other,\u201d \n\u201cbestow benefits or burdens based on sex,\u201d or \u201capply \none rule for males and another for females.\u201d  Pet. App. \n\n23 \n \n32a.  It does not \u201cdraw any distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d based on sex.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 800.   \nThe government claims (at 21) that SB1 \u201cdefin[es] \nthe prohibited medical care based on the patient\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  The law references \u201csex,\u201d but it does not \u201cdiffer-\nentiate\u201d based on sex.  Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10.  And \nthat is what matters.  \nAssessing the lines drawn by SB1 reveals the ab-\nsence of any sex classification.  The law creates two \ngroups: (1) minors seeking to use puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for gender transition, and (2) mi-\nnors seeking to use puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for other medical purposes.  The first group \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014neither boys nor \ngirls can use these drugs for gender transition.  \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  The second group also \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014both boys and girls \ncan use these drugs for other medical purposes.  Id.  \nUnder Geduldig, this \u201clack of identity\u201d between sex \nand the \u201cgroups\u201d created by SB1\u2019s line drawing means \nthat no facial \u201csex\u201d classification exists.  Id. \nThe government\u2019s requested remedy is telling too.  \nThe government has not sought an injunction that \nwould \u201ctreat boys and girls the same\u201d; it wants an in-\njunction to \u201callow\u201d \u201cpuberty blockers and hormones\u201d to \nbe administered for additional purposes.  Eknes-\nTucker, 80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring); see \nPet. App. 37a-38a.  That request shows that \u201cthe clas-\nsification drawn by the statute\u201d concerns the drugs\u2019 \nprescribed use, not a patient\u2019s sex.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 440. \n\n24 \n \nThe government pivots (at 21) to SB1\u2019s mere \u201cref-\nerenc[e]\u201d to sex.  But not every law that mentions sex \nclassifies based on sex.  Pet. App. 36a.  Take this hy-\npothetical statute: \u201cNeither men nor women may drive \nan automobile without a license.\u201d  It uses \u201csex-based \nterms,\u201d U.S. Br. 2, 13, but draws no sex-based lines.  \nThe mere \u201cuse of gender specific\u201d versus \u201cneutral\u201d \nterms has never controlled the sex-classification in-\nquiry.  Cf. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 64.  Otherwise, myriad \nlaws without sex or race classifications would \u201crequire \nheightened review.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  This Court rejects \nthat approach.  See Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 232 n.14; Jam \nv. Int\u2019l Fin. Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 208 (2019) (42 U.S.C. \n\u00a71981, which mentions \u201cwhite\u201d citizens, treats all \nraces equally).  So while SB1 uses \u201cthe word \u2018sex,\u2019\u201d it \ndoes not include \u201ca sex classification\u201d within the \nmeaning of \u201cequal-protection caselaw.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nThat conclusion in no way threatens the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cindividual[s].\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 24.  Tennessee\u2019s point is not that laws like \nSB1 can classify by sex yet avoid sex-based scrutiny \nby harming boys and girls \u201cin equal degree.\u201d  L.W. Br. \n27-28; accord U.S. Br. 24.  The point is that SB1 con-\ntains no sex classification at all.  A law taxing all citi-\nzens burdens both men and women, but like SB1, it \ndoes not burden both men and women through a sex \nclassification.  The cases cited by the challengers (at \nU.S. Br. 24; L.W. Br. 27-28) drive home this distinc-\ntion:  Striking a juror because he\u2019s a man (J.E.B.) or \nbecause he\u2019s black (Powers) are actions that classify \nbased on sex or race.   No such sex classification exists \nin SB1; the law differentiates based on age and use.   \n\n25 \n \n2. The government\u2019s gender-conformity \nassertions show no sex classification. \nNor does SB1 classify based on sex by restricting \nminors from engaging in \u201cnon-conforming\u201d behavior.  \nU.S. Br. 22-23, 41; L.W. Br. 22-23, 28.   \nFor starters, not all restrictions on non-conform-\ning behavior involve a sex-based classification.  Con-\nsider a pair of contrasting examples: (1) a school dress \ncode that requires boys to wear pants and girls to wear \nskirts and (2) a school dress code that permits only \npants.  A boy wants to wear a skirt, asserting a non-\nconformity interest.  Under the first policy, a sex-\nbased line regulates the boy:  girls can wear skirts, and \nboys cannot.  Under the second policy, by contrast, no \nsex-based line exists:  no one can wear skirts.  In both \nexamples, the boy wants to engage in a \u201cnon-conform-\ning\u201d activity that is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with stereotypical \nattire.  And in both examples, the boy is prohibited \nfrom doing so.  Yet only the first policy draws a sex-\nbased line.  The second policy, like SB1, does not.   \nThe plaintiffs err (at 22, 28) by equating SB1 to \nlaws that expressly classify religions, races, or the \nsexes.  A law prohibiting \u201cpeople from working in pro-\nfessions \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 their sex\u201d creates sex-\nbased lines: for some jobs, a male can have the job and \na female cannot, and vice versa.  SB1 imposes no sim-\nilar classification. \nAnd no authority permits an equal-protection \nclaim for \u201cpeople who fail to conform\u201d absent any sex-\nbased classification.  L.W. Br. 21; see U.S. Br. 23.  In-\nstead, cases like Craig (different male-female alcohol \n\n26 \n \npurchasing rules), Virginia (different male-female ad-\nmissions rules), and Morales-Santana (different male-\nfemale immigration rules) all involved clear, facial sex \nclassifications.  Craig, 429 U.S. at 198-99; Virginia, \n518 U.S. at 532-33; Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. 47, 62-63 (2017).  Though they discussed stereo-\ntyping in applying intermediate scrutiny, they did not \nuse that concept to conjure a sex classification from a \nsex-neutral rule.   \nTo the extent the government now attempts to \nbackdoor in an Arlington Heights discriminatory-pur-\npose claim through \u201cconformity,\u201d U.S. Br. 22, that ar-\ngument likewise fails.  The government never mean-\ningfully pressed this argument below, and it points to \nno disparate impact on one sex.  More important, \nSB1\u2019s aim is not \u201c[e]nforcing conformity.\u201d  L.W. Br. 42.   \nTennessee enacted SB1 \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  In \ndetailed findings, SB1 catalogs Tennessee\u2019s interests \nin regulating early gender-transition interventions to \nprotect minors and the integrity of the medical profes-\nsion.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(b)-(m).  Along the way, SB1 men-\ntions encouraging minors \u201cto appreciate\u201d and not be \n\u201cdisdainful of their sex\u201d as they \u201cundergo puberty.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  But contra challengers\u2019 repeated \nassertions, that language is no smoking gun.  Cf. L.W. \nBr. 1, 23, 42, 52; U.S. Br. 2, 8, 16-18, 22, 27, 32-34, 49.  \nIt simply acknowledges the problems with using un-\nproven gender-transition interventions on minors.  \nGiven high desistance rates among youth and the \ntragic \u201cregret\u201d of detransitioners, it was not improper \nto conclude that kids benefit from additional time to \n\n27 \n \n\u201cappreciate their sex\u201d before embarking on body-alter-\ning paths.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  Nor \nis it improper for the State to protect minors from pro-\ncedures that \u201cencourage [them] to become disdainful of \ntheir sex\u201d\u2014and thus at risk for serious psychiatric \nconditions.  Id. (emphasis added).  Especially when re-\nsearch shows that gender-transition interventions can \nmake mental distress worse.  J.A. 400-01.  \nThe government may disagree with that research. \nBut it cannot cast SB1 as stereotype-driven by carica-\nturing legislative findings that detail a range of health \nconcerns.  Chanting a \u201cconformity\u201d mantra does not \novercome the heavy \u201cpresumption of legislative good \nfaith,\u201d Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 603 (2018), or \ndrown out the compelling concerns that drove SB1. \nAnd it is insincere because\u2014even if that language \nwere omitted\u2014the government would be here chal-\nlenging SB1\u2019s restrictions all the same. \n3. The Sixth Circuit properly applied \nthe sex-classification framework.  \nThe government\u2019s claim that Chief Judge Sutton \n\u201cfundamentally misunderstood\u201d equal-protection law \ndistorts the decision below.  U.S. Br. 16.  The Sixth \nCircuit did not spottily concede a sex classification \u201cat \ntimes.\u201d  U.S. Br. 18-19, 24-25.   It found \u201cno\u201d sex-based \nline in SB1, period.  Pet. App. 32a.  Having concluded \nthat SB1 lacks any sex classification, the court \nproperly declined to apply heightened review.  Pet. \nApp. 32a-33a.   \nThat decision in no way \u201cconflates the classifica-\ntions drawn by the law with the state\u2019s justification for \n\n28 \n \nit.\u201d  U.S. Br. 26.  The Sixth Circuit recognized that the \n\u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d or \u201crisk-reward assessment\u201d for \na procedure depends on the reason for the procedure\u2019s \nuse.  Pet. App. 34a, 37a.  It highlighted that fact to \nhelp explain that SB1 classifies by procedures\u2019 distinct \nmedical uses, not patients\u2019 sex.  Id. \nThe challengers attack the Sixth Circuit for stat-\ning that the \u201cnecessity of heightened review[] will not \nbe present every time that sex factors into a govern-\nment decision.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2 (quoting Pet. App. 39a); \nU.S. Br. 24-25.  But that\u2019s just a rejection of the gov-\nernment\u2019s attempted use of but-for causation to create \na novel class of Bostock-based equal-protection claims.  \nSee infra Part II.C.  As the Sixth Circuit recognized, \nDobbs and Geduldig reject heightened scrutiny for \nsex-adjacent restrictions that draw no sex-based lines.  \nPet. App. 39a; infra 33-34.  Whether those decisions \nare characterized as concluding that no sex classifica-\ntion exists, infra 32-35, or that heightened scrutiny \ndoes not apply to sex-adjacent claims, Pet. App. 39a, \nthe result is the same.  It is the government and plain-\ntiffs, not the Sixth Circuit, that \u201cbreak[] from a half \ncentury of this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2. \nB. Boys and girls are not similarly situated \nfor purposes of SB1.  \nThe challengers\u2019 arguments fail for the independ-\nent reason that boys and girls \u201care not similarly situ-\nated\u201d for purposes of SB1\u2019s restrictions.  Michael M. v. \nSuperior Court, 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (plurality). \nAs the Sixth Circuit correctly noted, the sexes\u2019 biolog-\nical differences provide yet another basis for declining \nheightened scrutiny.  Pet. App. 39a.   \n\n29 \n \nThis Court has never read the Equal Protection \nClause to \u201crequire things which are different in fact or \nopinion to be treated in law as though they were the \nsame.\u201d  Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940).  It \nhas instead analyzed a law\u2019s justifications only after \ndetermining that \u201cthose who appear similarly situated \nare \u2026 treated differently.\u201d  Engquist, 553 U.S. at 602.  \nScores of lower-court cases agree and treat this \u201csimi-\nlarly situated\u201d question as a threshold inquiry.1   \nUnder this approach, \u201cthe absence of similarly sit-\nuated individuals treated differently is \u2026 simply a \nway of saying that the plaintiff failed at the first step \nto prove intentional discrimination\u201d\u2014a step that must \nbe satisfied \u201c[b]efore a court may get to the business of \nassessing\u201d the law\u2019s justifications.  SECSYS v. Vigil, \n666 F.3d 678, 688-89 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.).   \nNguyen\u2019s mention of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d in apply-\ning scrutiny is not to the contrary.  Cf. L.W. Br. 35-36; \nU.S. Cert. Reply 5.  That discussion came only after \nconcluding that a law treated men and women differ-\nently \u201cunder like circumstances.\u201d  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at \n60.  And whether boys are similarly situated to girls \n \n1 See, e.g., People v. Whitfield, 888 N.E.2d 1166, 1172-73 (Ill. \n2007), as modified (Apr. 23, 2008); Timberland Partners XXI v. \nIowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 757 N.W.2d 172, 175 (Iowa 2008); In re \nWeisgerber, 169 P.3d 321, 328 (Kan. 2007); Benitez v. Rasmussen, \n626 N.W.2d 209, 219 (Neb. 2001); Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 \nF.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001); Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, \n1312-13 (10th Cir. 1998); Women Prisoners v. D.C., 93 F.3d 910, \n924 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Klinger v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 731 \n(8th Cir. 1994). \n\n30 \n \nfor purposes of SB1 matters at the outset, even if it \nalso matters when analyzing means-ends fit. \nThe challengers\u2019 reliance on \u201cBostock\u2019s framework \nfor identifying sex discrimination\u201d supports the simi-\nlarly situated inquiry\u2019s gatekeeping role.  L.W. Br. 18; \nU.S. Br. 27.  Bostock stated that discrimination re-\nquires showing that the plaintiff was treated \u201cworse \nthan others who are similarly situated.\u201d  590 U.S. at \n657.  It just deemed that prerequisite met since \u201cho-\nmosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to \nemployment decisions.\u201d  Id. at 660.  If this Court con-\nstitutionalizes Bostock\u2019s but-for standard (it should \nnot, see infra Part II.C), then Bostock\u2019s similarly situ-\nated requirement must travel alongside. \nThe government previously proposed shoehorning \nthe similarly situated requirement into the applica-\ntion of intermediate scrutiny.  U.S. Cert. Reply 5.  But \nit never explains how the similarly situated inquiry \nfits into that analysis or why boys and girls are similar \nfor purposes of receiving cross-sex hormones.  Instead, \nit generally contests the evidentiary basis for restrict-\ning gender-transition procedures for minors. U.S. Br.  \n39-50.  That analysis ducks the similarly situated in-\nquiry altogether.   \nHere, there is no question that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 \u201cen-\nduring\u201d \u201c[p]hysical differences\u201d keep them from being \nsimilarly situated with respect to SB1\u2019s restriction on \ncross-sex hormones.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  \nProviding testosterone to a boy with delayed puberty \naddresses a distinct medical condition, whereas \nproviding it to a girl causes a physical condition (se-\nvere hyperandrogenism).  Supra 6; J.A. 500-01, 521-\n\n31 \n \n22, 769-79.  Similarly, providing estrogen to a girl with \npremature ovarian insufficiency addresses a distinct \nmedical condition, whereas providing it to a boy causes \na physical condition (hyperestrogenemia).  Supra 6; \nJ.A. 779-81; ES Guidelines at 3886. \nThe government\u2019s sex-discrimination argument \nwould compel this Court to accept that males and fe-\nmales are medically the same for SB1\u2019s purposes\u2014and \nthat providing testosterone to a female to transition is \nthe \u201csame treatment\u201d as providing it to a male with a \nphysical malady.  U.S. Br. 2, 15, 18, 28.  No equal-pro-\ntection test requires this anti-science mendacity. \nC. Bostock does not render SB1 sex based. \nFailing the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork, the government asks this Court to create a new \ncategory of sex classifications based on Bostock\u2019s but-\nfor logic.  U.S. Br. 21-23.  The briefing pitches this step \nas \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cobvious[].\u201d  L.W. Br. 16; U.S. Br. 21.  \nBut \u201cthis wolf comes as a wolf.\u201d  Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Using \nbut-for-sex reasoning to trigger heightened scrutiny \nwould make a hash of this Court\u2019s equal-protection ju-\nrisprudence.  It would conflict with Bostock\u2019s reason-\ning.  And it would drastically expand heightened re-\nview.  This Court should reject the government\u2019s mis-\nuse of Bostock.  But even under the but-for test, the \ngovernment loses.   \n\n32 \n \n1. This Court has never taken a but-for \napproach to equal-protection \nclassifications.  \nConstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for rule would \nabrogate decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.   \nCurrently, a challenger has two paths to height-\nened equal-protection review: a facial classification or \na disparate impact plus discriminatory purpose.  SB1 \ndoes not facially classify by sex.  Supra Part II.A.  So \nthat leaves only the \u201csensitive inquiry\u201d into whether \nfacially neutral laws were in fact driven by \u201cdiscrimi-\nnatory intent or purpose.\u201d  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \nat 265-66.  To make that showing, the asserted \u201cdis-\ncriminatory intent or purpose\u201d must target the suspect \ncharacteristic at issue\u2014not some other characteristic.  \nId. at 265; see Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health \nClinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) (sex-based claim \u201cde-\nmand[s] ... at least a purpose that focuses upon women \nby reason of their sex\u201d).   \nThe government invents a third path.  It claims \nthat heightened review applies when some non-sex-\nbased classification incorporates sex as a but-for mat-\nter.  That argument contradicts scores of cases.   \nMost obviously, but-for causation conflicts with \nthis Court\u2019s sexual-orientation cases.  For decades, \nthis Court has faced claims of sexual-orientation dis-\ncrimination under equal-protection theories\u2014includ-\ning Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996); United States \nv. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013); and Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 651 (2015).  \u201cBut in those cases, \nthe Court never suggested that sexual orientation dis-\n\n33 \n \ncrimination is just a form of sex discrimination.\u201d  Bos-\ntock, 590 U.S. at 797 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  It \nis \u201cimplausible\u201d to suggest that \u201cin all of those sexual \norientation cases\u201d the Court \u201coverlook[ed] the fact that \nsexual orientation discrimination is actually a form of \nsex discrimination\u201d under the Constitution.  Id. at 798.   \nPregnancy and abortion cases also belie a but-for \napproach.  In Geduldig, this Court assessed whether \nexcluding conditions arising from pregnancy from dis-\nability benefits coverage denied women equal protec-\ntion.  417 U.S. at 489.  It said no, even though sex is a \nbut-for cause of pregnancy and despite the dissent\u2019s \ncounter that \u201c[i]n effect, one set of rules is applied to \nfemales and another to males.\u201d  Id. at 501 (Brennan, \nJ., dissenting).  The Court kept its focus on the \u201clegis-\nlative classification\u201d and the groups that classification \ncreated.  Id. at 496 n.20.  It emphasized that a preg-\nnancy-related restriction \u201cis a far cry from cases like \nReed \u2026 and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 \n(1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as \nsuch.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nBray reiterated that reasoning when rejecting an \nargument that anti-abortion demonstrations consti-\ntuted \u201cipso facto\u201d discrimination \u201cagainst women as a \nclass.\u201d  506 U.S. at 271.  Bray reached that result over \na dissent that contended that \u201c[a] classification based \non pregnancy is a sex-based classification\u201d because \n\u201cthe capacity to become pregnant is a characteristic \nnecessarily associated with one\u201d sex.  Id. at 323 n.20, \n327 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This Court has declined \nto \u201crevisit\u201d this line of precedent.  Coleman v. Ct. of \n\n34 \n \nAppeals, 566 U.S. 30, 54 (2012) (Ginsburg, J., dissent-\ning).  It remains good law.  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236.    \nMore generally, a but-for approach is incompatible \nwith the conceptual underpinning of equal-protection \njurisprudence.  Heightened review rests on the idea \nthat \u201ccertain classifications \u2026 supply a reason to infer \nantipathy\u201d on the part of lawmakers.  Pers. Adm\u2019r of \nMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979).  The Court \nreplaces the presumption of legislative validity with \nheightened review only after a robust showing tied to \na particular characteristic.   Infra 44-45.  But in the \ngovernment\u2019s \nview, \nnon-suspect \nclasses \n(here, \ntransgender-identifying persons) could receive height-\nened protection by leveraging a different suspect char-\nacteristic (here, sex).  That approach transforms the \nobject of heightened protection and, in doing so, di-\nvorces heightened scrutiny from its justification. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 but-for argument finds no support in \ncases applying heightened scrutiny when sex is one \namong several classifications.  L.W. Br. 30.  Courts \nsometimes face laws that classify based on sex and \nsomething else.  For example, in Craig, a state law \nprohibited the sale of beer to males under 21 and fe-\nmales under 18, drawing lines based on sex and age.  \n429 U.S. at 192.  Packaging sex classifications with \nother considerations does not somehow immunize the \nsex classification from scrutiny.  But there must be a \nclassification based on sex itself to trigger heightened \nreview.  None of plaintiffs\u2019 cited cases (at 30) support \nusing but-for reasoning to transform a non-sex-based \nclassification into a sex classification.  This Court\u2019s \n\n35 \n \ntask is \u201conly to measure the basic validity of the legis-\nlative classification\u201d drawn.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272.   \n2. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications defies \nBostock\u2019s reasoning. \nBostock disavowed any extension of its Title VII \nreasoning to other laws, like the Equal Protection \nClause.  For good reason.  \u201cThe Constitution is not a \nstatute,\u201d R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S. 330, \n346-47 (1935), and this Court has \u201cnever held that the \nconstitutional standard for adjudicating claims of in-\nvidious ... discrimination is identical to the standards \napplicable under Title VII,\u201d Washington v. Davis, 426 \nU.S. 229, 239 (1976).  And Bostock\u2019s reasoning refutes \nthe government\u2019s attempt to transplant Title VII\u2019s \nbut-for test. \nFirst, Bostock\u2019s analysis was driven by Title VII\u2019s \n\u201cstarkly broad\u201d text.  590 U.S. at 680.  That text makes \nit \u201cunlawful \u2026 for an employer\u201d to take certain em-\nployment actions \u201cbecause of ... race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e-2(a)(1).  \nWith that wording, it is \u201calways unlawful\u201d (absent an \nenumerated defense) to take covered actions \u201cbecause \nof\u201d sex.   Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Presi-\ndent & Fellows of Harvard Coll. (SFFA), 600 U.S. 181, \n309 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  And Bostock \nread Title VII\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u201d language to require a \u201cfo-\ncus[] on but-for discrimination.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  But \nthe Equal Protection Clause \u201ccontains none of the text \nthat the Court interpreted in Bostock.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1229.  Instead, in language adopted almost \na century earlier, the Equal Protection Clause directs \n\n36 \n \na \u201cfocus[] on the denial of equal protection.\u201d  Pet. App. \n40a.  Unlike Title VII, that constitutional requirement \n\u201caddresses all manner of distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d and has been read to \u201cimpl[y] different degrees \nof judicial scrutiny for different kinds of classifica-\ntions.\u201d  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 308 (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring).  \u201cThat such differently worded provisions should \nmean the same thing is implausible on its face.\u201d  Id.; \nsee Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP, 144 S.Ct. \n1221, 1260 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring).    \nSecond, structural considerations cut differently.  \nTitle VII incorporates a \u201csweeping\u201d but-for standard \nyet cabins liability to certain employment actions and \nemployers.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656-57.  As Bostock \nnoted, Title VII\u2019s non-discrimination rule also inter-\nacts with the statute\u2019s defenses and protections ap-\npearing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Id. \nat 681-82; Pet. App. 41a.  Those statutory features \ncheck the extension of broad but-for-based liability be-\nyond Title VII\u2019s limited coverage.  By contrast, the \nEqual Protection Clause governs all governmental ac-\ntion and lacks the deliberate checks that Bostock \nstressed.  Subjecting all governmental action to but-\nfor liability would collide with religious liberties and \nother constitutional rights in a manner Bostock no-\nwhere endorsed.   \nThird, Bostock\u2019s but-for standard fits with this \nCourt\u2019s \u201cthree ... leading precedents\u201d on Title VII.  590 \nU.S. at 663.  But as discussed, this Court\u2019s equal-pro-\ntection precedents cut the opposite way.  Supra 32-35.   \nFourth, congressional revisions to Title VII drive \nhome key distinctions between Title VII and the Equal \n\n37 \n \nProtection Clause.  Originally, this Court applied \nGeduldig\u2019s classification test to reject the argument \nthat Title VII\u2019s reference to \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d covers \npregnancy discrimination.  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, \n429 U.S. 125, 133-36 (1976).  Congress responded by \nspecifying that \u201cbecause of sex\u201d includes discrimina-\ntion \u201con the basis of pregnancy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e(k)\u2014\nconfirming that Title VII\u2019s causal inquiry sweeps be-\nyond the classification-focused Equal Protection \nClause.   \n3. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications would \nsubvert sex-based review.   \nConstitutionalizing a but-for approach would re-\nmove important guardrails on heightened review. \nAdopting the government\u2019s logic would open the \ndoor to disparate-impact liability under the Constitu-\ntion.  Laws relating to sex-specific medical proce-\ndures\u2014whether prostate cancer treatments, circumci-\nsions, erectile-dysfunction medications, or breast-\nfeeding therapies\u2014may have to \u201crun[] the gauntlet of \nskeptical judicial review\u201d under the theory that sex is \na but-for cause.  Pet. App. 35a-36a.  The same would \ngo for pregnancy-related restrictions, contra Geduldig, \nand for abortion regulations, contra Dobbs.   \nThe heightened-scrutiny fallout would spiral be-\nyond sex.  Are government employers\u2019 no-visa-spon-\nsorship policies unconstitutional because national \norigin is a but-for cause of needing a visa?  Is race a \nbut-for cause when a university credits an applicant\u2019s \nessay about how racial discrimination \u201caffected his or \n\n38 \n \nher life\u201d?  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230.  Is racial lineage a \nbut-for cause of any law regulating tribal members?  \nSee 25 U.S.C. \u00a71915(a); 1 Navajo Nation Code \u00a7701.  \nAccepting the government\u2019s theory would leave courts \npuzzling through these and whatever other but-for co-\nnundrums creative lawyers concoct. \nA but-for approach would also allow new classes to \nwield heightened scrutiny in a way that harms \nwomen.  Women\u2019s heightened legal protections reflect \ntheir history of being targeted with \u201cpervasive\u201d dis-\ncrimination and disadvantage.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n273.  But if the government\u2019s theory holds, men who \nidentify as women could claim constitutionally based \naccess to women\u2019s bathrooms,2 women\u2019s locker rooms,3 \nand women\u2019s sports.4  Accepting that theory would \nperversely erode women\u2019s rights and jeopardize land-\nmark statutes protecting women\u2019s equal access to \nschools, winners\u2019 podiums, and beyond.    \nOn top of all that, the but-for causation test would \nset the Equal Protection Clause on a collision course \nwith the Free Exercise Clause.  Conflicting rights will \narise for doctors at State-run hospitals with conscien-\ntious objections, students whose religious convictions \nprevent the sharing of intimate spaces with the oppo-\nsite sex, and so on.  Unlike Congress in the statutory \n \n2 U.S. Br., Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. John\u2019s Cnty., No. 18-13592, \n(11th Cir.), Doc. 254. \n3 U.S. Statement, Roe v. Critchfield, No. 1:23-cv-00315-DCN (D. \nIdaho), Doc. 41. \n4 U.S. Br., B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078 (4th \nCir.), Doc. 68. \n\n39 \n \ncontext, this Court could not carve the government\u2019s \nproposed but-for-sex mandates out of the Constitution \nto protect \u201csincere[]\u201d religious views.  Religious Sisters \nof Mercy v. Becerra, 55 F.4th 583, 598 (8th Cir. 2022).  \nNor would \u201cfederal conscience laws\u201d be an out, since \nthe Constitution would trump.  FDA v. All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 387 (2024).  The impossible \ntask of measuring the relative import of conflicting re-\nligion and equal-protection claims is yet another prob-\nlem attending the government\u2019s but-for test.   \n4. Regardless, sex is not a but-for cause \nin SB1.  \nThis Court should reject the but-for test outright. \nBut the government loses even under its own test be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  \nChanging a person\u2019s \u201csex\u201d does not change the availa-\nbility of the drugs regulated by SB1.    \nPuberty Blockers:  The government\u2019s argument \nbarely mentions puberty blockers.  Fitting, because \n\u201cpuberty blockers involve the same drug used equally \nby gender-transitioning boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 38a \n(emphasis added).  If a boy seeks puberty blockers to \ntransition, he cannot have them.  If a girl seeks pu-\nberty blockers to transition, she cannot have them.  So \n\u201cholding other things constant but changing the mi-\nnor\u2019s sex\u201d does not, in fact, \u201cyield a different outcome.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  Sex does not dictate SB1\u2019s \nlimits on puberty blockers, even as a but-for matter.   \n\n40 \n \nCross-Sex Hormones:  The same goes for cross-sex \nhormones.  No boy can receive hormones to transition; \nlikewise, no girl can receive hormones to transition. \nBut either can receive hormones to treat physical ab-\nnormalities. Medical purpose, not sex, dictates availa-\nbility under SB1.  Cf. Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, \n181-82 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., dissenting) \n(finding no sex-discrimination while applying Bos-\ntock\u2019s but-for test).    \nThe government\u2019s counter changes both sex and \nmedical purpose.  It claims (at 21-22) that a female \n\u201ccannot receive \u2026 testosterone to live and present as \na male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.\u201d  \nBut the provision of testosterone to boys \u201cto treat a mi-\nnor\u2019s congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or \nphysical injury,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A), \ndoes not serve the same medical purpose as the provi-\nsion of testosterone to a girl who wants to transition.  \nThe same drug is at issue.  But it is used at different \ndosages and for different medical purposes.  See J.A. \n769-70.  Just like administering morphine to \u201cease [a] \npatient\u2019s pain\u201d is not the same as using morphine to \nassist a patient\u2019s suicide.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 802.  The \ngovernment\u2019s argument conflates \u201cdistinct uses of tes-\ntosterone and estrogen.\u201d  Pet. App. 34a.   \nSeparately, biological realities mean that only \nboys use estrogen for the purpose of transitioning to \nan \u201cidentity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1)(A).  So too with girls and \ntestosterone.  But laws regulating treatments \u201c\u2018that \nonly one sex can undergo\u2019 ordinarily do not \u2018trigger \n\n41 \n \nheightened constitutional scrutiny.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 33a \n(quoting Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236); supra 32-35.   \nThe upshot: \u201c[H]olding other things constant but \nchanging the minor\u2019s sex\u201d does not change the outcome \nunder SB1.  U.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  The government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to show \nany differential outcome.  It fails its own but-for-sex \ntest. \nIII. SB1 Contains No Transgender Classification \nthat Warrants Heightened Scrutiny \nThe government\u2019s transgender-discrimination ar-\ngument likewise gets it nowhere.  SB1 contains no \ntransgender-based classification.  And heightened \nscrutiny would not apply in any event. \nA. SB1 does not classify based on \ntransgender status. \nThe government assumes (at 16, 28-29) that SB1 \ncontains facial transgender classifications, even in the \nface of a circuit split on the issue.  But SB1 regulates \nbased on medical use, not transgender status.  \nTransgender-identifying minors are in both \u201cgroups\u201d \ncreated by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  A \ntransgender-identifying minor can receive puberty \nblockers for some purposes (e.g., to treat precocious \npuberty); a transgender-identifying minor cannot re-\nceive puberty blockers for other purposes (e.g., to tran-\nsition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  The same \ngoes for cross-sex hormones.  Transgender-identifying \npersons fall on both sides of the line.  There is thus a \n\u201clack of identity\u201d between transgender status and the \n\n42 \n \ngroups created by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 \nn.20. \nAny disparate impact on transgender-identifying \npersons does not create a classification under the \nEqual Protection Clause.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-78.  \nAgain, heightened scrutiny does not apply to \u201c[t]he \nregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex \ncan undergo\u201d unless \u201cthe regulation is a \u2018mere pretext \ndesigned to effect an invidious discrimination.\u2019\u201d \nDobbs, 597 U.S. at 236 (cleaned up) (quoting Geduldig, \n417 U.S. at 496 n.20); see Bray, 506 U.S. at 271 (simi-\nlar).  So too with a transgender-discrimination claim:  \nThe government must show that SB1 is a \u201cpretext for \ninvidious discrimination\u201d against transgender-identi-\nfying individuals.  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th 1229-30; see \nKadel, 100 F.4th at 174 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  \nThe government has not \u201cmade the case that ani-\nmus toward transgender individuals as a class drives \nthis law.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a-47a.  Again, the parties did \nnot meaningfully press this argument below.  And this \nCourt \u201chas long disfavored arguments based on al-\nleged legislative motives.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 253.  Ju-\ndicial attempts to ascertain these \u201cmotivation[s]\u201d nec-\nessarily \u201crepresent a substantial intrusion into the \nworkings of other branches of government.\u201d  Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 268 n.18.  Courts are even more \n\u201creluctan[t] to attribute unconstitutional motives to \nthe states,\u201d Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394 (1983), \ngiven the federalism stakes.  Here, the government \nflippantly suggests that Tennessee, 23 \u201cother States,\u201d \nand apparently much of Europe have followed \u201cfar-\n\n43 \n \nright interest groups\u201d to \u201ctarget[] transgender individ-\nuals.\u201d  U.S. Br. 7 n.3, 8; see L.W. Br. 53.  But charges \nof discriminatory purpose demand more than tired \ntalking points.   \nNor could the government clear the Arlington \nHeights bar if it tried.  SB1 arose from a publicized \ncontroversy about ill-supported medical practices at a \nmajor Tennessee hospital.  It contains substantial fac-\ntual findings exhibiting the legislature\u2019s sincere con-\ncern with protecting kids.  And it leaves open gender-\ntransition interventions for transgender-identifying \nadults.  Although the government tries (at 8) to situate \nSB1 in a \u201cseries\u201d of Tennessee laws \u201ctargeting\u201d \ntransgender-identifying people, that narrative ignores \nthat many such measures countered federal efforts to \nimpose unprecedented gender-identity mandates gov-\nerning pronouns, bathroom and sports access, and \nmore.  See, e.g., Tennessee v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 104 F.4th \n577, 586 (6th Cir. 2024).  None of the government\u2019s \nsideswipes surmount the heavy \u201cpresumption of legis-\nlative good faith.\u201d  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 603. \nThat leaves the argument that the Court should \npresume animus under a \u201cproxy\u201d-discrimination the-\nory.  But winning that argument requires showing \nthat \u201cno rational, nondiscriminatory explanation ex-\nists for the law\u2019s classification.\u201d Kadel, 100 F.4th at \n170 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  The restricted activ-\nity must be \u201csuch an irrational object of disfavor that \n\u2026 an intent to disfavor [a] class can readily be pre-\nsumed\u201d\u2014in the same way a \u201ctax on wearing yarmul-\nkes\u201d would be considered a \u201ctax on Jews.\u201d  Bray, 506 \n\n44 \n \nU.S. at 270.  Regulating yarmulkes is an \u201cirrational \nsurrogate.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nHere, though, rational explanations beyond bare \n\u201chostility\u201d abound.  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, \n374 (1886).  SB1 could (and did) spring from the \u201ccom-\nmon and respectable\u201d impetus to protect minors from \nunproven procedures that can permanently alter their \nlives.  Bray, 506 U.S. at 270; see Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n274-75 (declining to presume animus when \u201clegitimate \nand worthy purposes\u201d supported the Act).  That these \ntreatments are sought primarily by transgender-iden-\ntifying persons cannot alone support a presumption of \nanimus, lest this Court\u2019s restrictions on disparate-im-\npact claims disappear.  See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-75; \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20; Bray, 506 U.S. at 270.5   \nB. Heightened scrutiny does not apply to \ntransgender-related classifications.  \nIntermediate scrutiny would not follow anyway.  \nThis Court has never recognized transgender-identify-\ning persons as a suspect class, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n440-41 (listing five protected classes), and it should \nnot add to the short list of protected characteristics. \n \n5 Notably, the government is not equating gender dysphoria with \ntransgender status.  It knows that \u201cnot all transgender persons \nhave gender dysphoria.\u201d  J.A. 61.  And like transgender-identify-\ning persons, gender-dysphoric persons can be in both groups cre-\nated by SB1.  Moreover, this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses the ap-\nplication of heightened scrutiny based on disability, infra 47, and \nthe federal government has elsewhere designated gender dyspho-\nria as \u201ca disability,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 40,066, 40,068-69 (May 9, 2024). \n\n45 \n \nThis Court long ago \u201clost interest\u201d in creating new \nquasi-suspect classes beyond the few already recog-\nnized.  Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 318-\n19 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Over the past \nhalf-century, it has declined repeated requests to ex-\npand its list of protected characteristics\u2014declining \nheightened review to homosexual individuals, Wind-\nsor, 570 U.S. at 770; close relatives, Lyng v. Castillo, \n477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); the mentally disabled, \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 441-46; and the aged, Murgia, \n427 U.S. at 313.  Rightfully so.  Both assessing puta-\ntive \u201csuspectness\u201d and applying means-end scrutiny \nverge on a \u201cjudge-empowering interest-balancing in-\nquiry\u201d beyond the judicial ken.  N.Y. State Rifle & Pis-\ntol Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 22 (2022) (quotations \nomitted).  This Court should not reopen that door.   \nAnd it certainly should not recognize a new quasi-\nsuspect class here.  To justify heightened scrutiny, this \nCourt has asked whether a \u201cdiscrete group\u201d warrants \nspecial protection in light of its \u201cimmutable\u201d charac-\nteristics, \u201cpolitical[] powerless[ness],\u201d and history of \ndiscriminatory treatment.  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  The \ngovernment falls short on each.   \nFirst, transgender-identifying persons do not \u201cex-\nhibit obvious, immutable, or distinguishing character-\nistics that define them as a discrete group.\u201d  Pet. App. \n45a (quoting Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 \n(1987)).  No one argues that transgender status is an \n\u201cimmutable\u201d characteristic.  U.S. Br. 30; L.W. Br. 38. \nNor is there a credible claim that transgender status \nis \u201cobvious,\u201d since gender identity turns on each per-\nson\u2019s internal and often fluid \u201csense of belonging to a \n\n46 \n \nparticular gender.\u201d  J.A. 9; see WPATH-8 at S41.  And \nfar from being a \u201cdiscrete group,\u201d U.S. Br. 30, \n\u201ctransgender\u201d can describe \u201ca huge variety of gender \nidentities and expressions,\u201d WPATH-8 at S15.  Accord-\ning to WPATH, a transgender-identifying person can \nbe \u201cmore than one gender identity simultaneously or \nat different times (e.g., bigender),\u201d \u201cnot have a gender \nidentity or have a neutral gender identity (e.g., \nagender or neutrois),\u201d \u201chave gender identities that en-\ncompass or blend elements of other genders (e.g., pol-\nygender, demiboy, demigirl),\u201d or \u201chave a gender that \nchanges over time (e.g., genderfluid).\u201d  Id. at S80, S88, \nS252.  As the government\u2019s amici put it, \u201ctransgender\u201d \nis an \u201cumbrella term\u201d that covers \u201cvaried groups.\u201d Br. \nof American Psychological Association as Amicus Cu-\nriae 6 n.7.  \nSecond, \nit \nblinks \nreality \nto \nassert \nthat \ntransgender-identifying persons do not \u201cwield political \npower.\u201d  U.S. Br. 30.  The current Administration has \nprioritized \u201cPreventing and Combating Discrimina-\ntion on the Basis of Gender Identity\u201d across Executive \nBranch functions.  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. \nReg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  The current President has \n\u201cappointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ lead-\ners.\u201d  White House, A Proclamation on Transgender \nDay of Visibility (Mar. 30, 2023), perma.cc/VZN6-\n4ATC.  And federal agencies have written gender-\nidentity directives into every nook and cranny of fed-\neral law, creating new transgender-specific regula-\ntions \nfor \nthe \nworkplace, \neducational \nsystem, \nhealthcare \nfield, \nand \nfoster-care \nprograms.  \nTransgender-identifying persons have flexed their po-\n\n47 \n \nlitical muscle at the state level, too, persuading legis-\nlatures to provide enhanced statutory rights.  E.g., \nCal. Educ. Code \u00a7221.5(f); Va. Code Ann. \u00a738.2-3449.1; \nWash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a728A.642.080.  Against this \nbackdrop (and with more than a third of the U.S. \nHouse in support, see Br. of 164 Members of Congress \nas Amicus Curiae), it is impossible to argue that \ntransgender-identifying persons are \u201cpolitically pow-\nerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract \nthe attention of lawmakers.\u201d  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n445.  That they have not found success on every issue \nin every State does not prove powerlessness.  Pet. App. \n46a. \nThird, the government and plaintiffs cannot rest \ntheir case for heightened scrutiny on a \u201chistory of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  L.W. Br. 38.  In Cleburne, the Court de-\nclined to hold that the mentally disabled constituted a \nquasi-suspect class \u201cdespite a history of compulsory \nsterilization, exclusion from public schools, and a sys-\ntem of \u2018state-mandated segregation and degradation\u2019 \n\u2018that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed \nparalleled, the worst excesses of Jim Crow.\u2019\u201d  Eknes-\nTucker, 114 F.4th at 1266 (Lagoa, J., concurring) \n(quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 462-63 (Marshall, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part)).  The answer to \nfurther instances of \u201cinvidious\u201d discrimination, the \nCourt explained, was to analyze animus case by case, \n\u201cnot to create a new quasi-suspect classification and \nsubject all governmental action based on that classifi-\ncation to more searching evaluation.\u201d Cleburne, 473 \nU.S. at 446.  Likewise, laws regulating the physically \ndisabled fall under rational-basis review despite the \nhistory of discrimination against that group.  Board of \n\n48 \n \nTrustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365-68 (2001).  The \nchallengers nowhere explain why transgender-identi-\nfying persons warrant more favorable treatment. \nAt bottom, creating a new quasi-suspect class will \nremove \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d from the \u201carena of pub-\nlic debate and legislative action\u201d and vest them in the \nfederal judiciary.  Pet. App. 45a.  \u201cBathrooms and \nlocker rooms.  Sports teams and sports competitions.  \nOthers are sure to follow.\u201d  Pet. App. 45a.  And this \nCourt, rather than the democratic process, would have \nto resolve every last issue through open-ended interest \nbalancing.  It should not start down that path.    \nIV. SB1 Survives Constitutional Scrutiny \nSB1 passes constitutional review under any stand-\nard.  \u201c[L]ike other health and welfare laws,\u201d it war-\nrants only rational-basis scrutiny, Dobbs, 597 U.S. at \n301, and easily satisfies that test, Pet. App. 48a-50a.  \nEven under intermediate scrutiny, SB1 poses no con-\nstitutional problem.  Its age- and use-based limits per-\nmissibly serve \u201cimportant\u201d ends through \u201csubstan-\ntially related\u201d means, Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, par-\nticularly given lawmakers\u2019 \u201cwide discretion\u201d in areas \nof \u201cmedical and scientific uncertainty,\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.   \nA. Tennessee has compelling governmental \ninterests. \nAll agree that Tennessee\u2019s \u201cinterest in safeguard-\ning the physical and psychological well-being of a mi-\nnor is compelling.\u201d  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, \n756-57 (1982) (quotations omitted).  Tennessee has \n\u201cauthority, in truth a responsibility, to look after the \n\n49 \n \nhealth and safety\u201d of minors in the State.  Pet. App. \n115a.  And \u201cprotecting minors from dangerous and \nrisky treatments\u201d is part and parcel of that duty.  L.W. \nBr. 41; U.S. Br. 19.   \nTennessee has an independent interest \u201cin pro-\ntecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profes-\nsion.\u201d  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 731.  History is punctu-\nated with shocking stories of medical \u201cabuse [and] ne-\nglect,\u201d id.\u2014with many questionable practices (like lo-\nbotomies and eugenics) initially finding support from \nthe medical establishment.  States thus have an im-\nportant interest in ensuring the integrity and ethics of \nmedical practice within their borders.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a768-33-101(m). \nB. SB1 substantially relates to Tennessee\u2019s \ninterests. \nSB1\u2019s restrictions are in \u201csubstantial furtherance\u201d \nof Tennessee\u2019s interests.  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70.  The \ngovernment second-guesses elected lawmakers\u2019 judg-\nment and asks this Court to do the same.  But this \nCourt should not snuff out legislative developments in \nan evolving area by enshrining the government\u2019s \nskewed science into the Constitution. \nSB1 reflects lawmakers\u2019 resolution of a genuine \nmedical debate.  In circumstances like these, \u201clegisla-\ntive options must be especially broad and courts \nshould be cautious not to rewrite legislation.\u201d  Kansas \nv. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360 n.3 (1997) (quotations \nomitted). \u201cIt is not a part of [the courts\u2019] functions to \nconduct investigations of facts entering into questions \nof public policy.\u201d  Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678, \n\n50 \n \n685 (1888); Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. \n180, 195 (1997).  Federal judges are no more equipped \nto resolve such issues than \u201cpeople picked at random \nfrom the ... telephone directory.\u201d  Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. \nDep\u2019t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 293 (1990) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring).   \nRecognizing as much, the Court has repeatedly \nstressed that lawmakers have \u201cwide discretion to pass \nlegislation in areas where there is medical and scien-\ntific uncertainty.\u201d  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 163; see, e.g., \nDobbs 597 U.S. at 274; Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 360 n.3; \nJones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 364 n.13, 370 \n(1983); Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 \n(1974); Williamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483, 488-\n89 (1955).  Such deference is appropriate even when \nheightened scrutiny applies.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n163-64 (undue-burden standard).  Any other approach \nwould raise the problem of setting \u201cjudicially manage-\nable standards for ascertaining whether a treatment \nis \u2018established\u2019 or \u2018necessary.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation \nomitted).   \nThis deferential framework for assessing legisla-\ntive judgments on unsettled health questions makes \nupholding SB1 straightforward.  SB1\u2019s age- and use-\nbased restrictions reflect lawmakers\u2019 well-informed \njudgment about the rise, risks, and disputed benefits \nof gender-transition procedures.  Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a768-33-101.  After receiving evidence and holding \nhearings, the legislature made specific findings \nsourced in its assessment of the regulated interven-\ntions\u2019 serious \u201crisks and harms\u201d and concerns over mi-\nnors\u2019 ability to provide informed consent.  Id.; see J.A. \n\n51 \n \n893-97, 905.  Against those risks, the legislature con-\ncluded that the putative benefits of such procedures \nremain unproven.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(b), (g).  \nSo it determined that deferring certain gender-transi-\ntion procedures until adulthood was the best course.  \nThat approach substantially furthers lawmakers\u2019 in-\nterest in protecting minors and medical ethics.   \nTennessee\u2019s view of the science is well founded, \nbut the State unquestionably legislated in an area of \nscientific uncertainty.  Many authorities, from leading \nEuropean agencies to courts, have recognized the un-\ncertainty surrounding gender-dysphoria treatments.  \nSee supra 8; Pet. App. 47a-48a; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th \nat 1225; Gibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 221 (5th Cir. \n2019); State v. Loe, 692 S.W.3d 215, 222 (Tex. 2024).  \nSo have pro-intervention advocacy groups like \nWPATH and the Endocrine Society.  WPATH-8 at S33 \n(citing need for \u201cfuture research\u201d); ES Guidelines at \n3874 (emphasizing need for \u201cmore rigorous evalua-\ntions of the effectiveness and safety of endocrine and \nsurgical protocols\u201d).  And SB1 arose after a leading \nprovider of gender-transition procedures for Tennes-\nsee minors admitted she was \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Su-\npra 11.  The uncertainty surrounding minors\u2019 gender-\ntransition treatments provides a \u201csufficient basis\u201d to \nuphold SB1.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 164.   \nThe government, by contrast, would have this \nCourt choose a side in this contested medical debate.  \nU.S. Br. 33-49.  But its arguments for displacing Ten-\nnessee\u2019s legislative judgment fail. \nClear error.  The government says (at 36) that the \nclear-error standard requires upholding the district \n\n52 \n \ncourt\u2019s \u201cfindings.\u201d  But the district court failed to re-\nview Tennessee\u2019s legislative \u201cfactfinding under a def-\nerential standard,\u201d as required.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n165; Turner, 520 U.S. at 195.  And this Court does not \ngive clear-error weight to findings made under an \u201cer-\nroneous standard.\u201d  Inwood Laboratories v. Ives La-\nboratories, 456 U.S. 844, 855, n.15 (1982); Abbott, 585 \nU.S. at 607 (same, when failed to presume good faith).  \nRegardless, the district court did clearly err in \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence in light of the prevailing \nstandards of care and conclusions contained in the \nWPATH and Endocrine Society guidelines.\u201d  Pet. App. \n181a. \nRisks and benefits.  The government\u2019s one-sided \ntelling of the risk-benefit evidence misstates (at 34-44) \nthe legislative record and medical landscape.  Tennes-\nsee did not \u201cignore[]\u201d the \u201cmedical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.\u201d  U.S. Br. 34-36 (capitali-\nzation altered).  In fact, SB1\u2019s findings specifically ref-\nerence the potential \u201cbenefits\u201d of gender-transition \nsurgeries; the legislature just found\u2014relying on Euro-\npean health authorities\u2014a dearth of \u201cevidence that \nthe benefits of these procedures outweigh the risks.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e).  Tennessee\u2019s consider-\nation of evidence was \u201cmeaningful,\u201d even if the govern-\nment would have preferred a different result.     \nThe government\u2019s assertion that SB1 bucks \u201cmed-\nical consensus\u201d (at 36) is hard to take seriously.  Half \nof the States have restricted access to pharmaceutical \nand surgical gender-transition procedures for mi-\nnors\u2014each making their own good-faith findings.  \nDoctors have publicly questioned the propriety of \n\n53 \n \nproviding these interventions to minors.6  And many \nof the European countries that pioneered these treat-\nments have pulled back on their use because of the un-\ncertainty surrounding efficacy and safety.  Supra 8; \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e) (citing shift).  The gov-\nernment cannot manufacture \u201cconsensus\u201d by ignoring \nEuropean health authorities that SB1 references.  \nU.S. Br. 36; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e). \nNor does citing a \u201cmajority\u201d view of \u201cmedical or-\nganization[s]\u201d negate the legislature\u2019s prerogative.  \nU.S. Br. 35.  Organizational say-so does not \u201cshed light \non the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. \nat 273.  Any other approach \u201cwould mean that the \nstate and federal legislatures would lose authority to \nregulate the healthcare industry whenever the subject \nof regulation\u2014the medical profession and drug com-\npanies\u2014found such regulation unnecessary\u201d or mis-\nguided.  Pet. App. 28a.  And what if these organiza-\ntions \u201cchange course in the future? Would the States\u2019 \nauthority reappear at that point?\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.  \nShifting deference from legislative findings to organi-\nzations only redirects power from accountable officials \nto interest groups.   \nThis case highlights the dangers of medical organ-\nizations driving constitutional law.  Below, the chal-\nlengers argued that WPATH\u2019s Guidelines reflect \u201c[t]he \nbest evidence of the correct standard of care.\u201d  Pet. \nApp.  29a.  And they convinced the district court to rely \n \n6 Kaltiala et al., Youth Gender Transition Is Pushed Without Ev-\nidence, Wall St. J. (July 13, 2023), perma.cc/P9GM-MHF7. \n\n54 \n \non WPATH\u2019s Guidelines as the framework for \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 181a.  Now, \nwith WPATH\u2019s credibility shot, the government turns \n(at 35) to other organizations\u2014the AAP and the Amer-\nican Medical Association\u2014that push the same poli-\ncies.  But AAP\u2019s positions have been debunked too.  \nJ.A. 448-49; Appendix 2, D.Ct.Doc. 113-3 at 184-91.  \nThe Constitution does not require States to play \nwhack-a-mole with whatever advocacy organization\u2019s \nstance suits challengers\u2019 needs.   \nThe government invokes the oft-repeated claim \nthat laws like SB1 increase suicide risk and mental-\nhealth problems.  U.S. Br. 36-38; L.W. Br. 44-45.  But \n\u201creal, hard science\u201d for this position is lacking.  Florida \nv. HHS, 2024 WL 3537510, at *16 (M.D. Fla. July 3, \n2024).  No studies document a reduction in suicide \nrates due to gender-transition interventions\u2014as the \nlauded Cass Review noted.  J.A. 398-401, 671-75; Cass \nReview at 33.  And the evidence supporting mitigated \nsuicidality is inconclusive and conflicts with other \nstudies\u2014including one showing that hormonal inter-\nventions increased mental distress.  J.A. 400-01, 452-\n55, 462-67, 664-70; Florida, 2024 WL 3537510, at *19 \nn.17. \nThe government cannot dodge the countervailing \nrisks posed by gender-transition interventions.  The \ngovernment downplays desistence (at 41) with expert \ntestimony asserting that adolescent desistence is \n\u201crare[].\u201d  But desistence is not theoretical.  Minors can \nand do grow up to regret the life-long results transi-\ntion treatments produce.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n\n55 \n \n101(h).  Apparently, even though \u201cmany detransition-\ners\u201d are telling their tragic stories, \u201c[a]cknowledge-\nment that de-transition exists to even a minor extent \nis considered off limits\u201d for the government.  See \nEknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th at 1269 (Lagoa, J., concur-\nring) (quotations omitted).  The Constitution does not \ncompel lawmakers to shield their eyes from detransi-\ntioners\u2019 experiences.  \nAnd no amount of rose-colored ink overwrites the \ndocumented downsides of puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormones.  Supra 5-6; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n101(b).  The government\u2019s portrayal of the risks con-\ntradicts even the advocacy organizations on which it \nrelies.  Compare U.S. Br. at 3, 42-44, with ES Guide-\nlines at 3874, 3882, 3886-87. \nTailoring.  The government claims (at 44-49) that \nSB1 is both too narrow and too broad.  The govern-\nment\u2019s underinclusiveness argument presumes that \nprescribing these drugs always poses the same \u201crisks.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 44-47; L.W. Br. 19, 42-43.  That premise fails:  \nThe medical risks differ because of biological differ-\nences between boys and girls, supra 30-31, and the \nrisk of desistance is not present in other circumstances \nof medical need.  Moreover, medical risk doesn\u2019t arise \nin a vacuum; it instead must be measured against the \nbenefits of the procedure.  A double mastectomy might \ncarry the same risk when performed on a woman with \nbreast cancer and on a 17-year-old girl who wants to \nidentify as a man.  But the measurable benefits differ.  \nThe contrary view recycles the government\u2019s incorrect \n\n56 \n \nattempt to equate giving minors drugs for gender tran-\nsition with employing the same drugs to treat physical \ndeficiencies or abnormalities.   \nNor do claims of \u201csevere overinclusiv[ity]\u201d work.  \nU.S. Br. 47-49; L.W. Br. 48-50.  SB1 does not \u201cpro-\nhibit[] all treatment for all transgender adolescents.\u201d  \nL.W. Br. 49.  It leaves open \u201cless invasive approaches \nthat are likely to result in better outcomes for the mi-\nnor,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(c)\u2014the watchful-\nwaiting and psychotherapy methods that predomi-\nnated until the past decade, supra 4-5; Pet. App. 29a. \nEven the government seems to accept that provid-\ners should not use \u201cany medical intervention to treat \ngender dysphoria before the onset of puberty.\u201d  U.S. \nBr. 41.  And it has (at least at times) agreed that sur-\ngeries should be off-limits for all minors.  So its tailor-\ning disagreement boils down to disputing SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions on medications from the onset of puberty to \nadulthood.  That argument, though, does not turn on \ndifferential treatment based on sex; it turns on the age \nat which SB1 drew its line.  And so long as \u201cthe age \nclassification in question is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest,\u201d States may draw lines with-\nout \u201cmatch[ing] age distinctions\u201d to the \u201cinterests they \nserve with razorlike precision.\u201d  Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of \nRegents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).   \nThe remaining tailoring arguments also fail.  Even \nif \u201cat least some transgender adolescents would bene-\nfit from the banned treatments,\u201d L.W. Br. 48, that ig-\nnores doctors\u2019 inability to \u201cpredict\u201d which minors will \nlater regret these interventions, J.A. 643.  The govern-\n\n57 \n \nment\u2019s preferred policies\u2014like \u201cgatekeeping,\u201d \u201clicens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements\u201d\u2014like-\nwise fail to account for detransitioners.  U.S. Br. 48.  \nIn any event, intermediate scrutiny does not require \nSB1 to \u201cbe capable of achieving its ultimate objective \nin every instance,\u201d Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70, or mandate \nthat Tennessee allow experimental research on kids, \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1235-36 (Brasher, J., con-\ncurring). \n*** \nMany doctors, States, and countries share Tennes-\nsee\u2019s view on gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors; the federal government and others do not.  This \n\u201cearnest and profound debate about the morality, le-\ngality, and practicality\u201d of controversial medical prac-\ntices can continue only if this Court refrains from con-\nstitutionalizing one side\u2019s position.  Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 735.  The question is not whose assessment of \nthe medical dispute is best, but whether the States in \n1868 ceded their power to enact age- and use-based \nlimits on pharmaceutical interventions like SB1\u2019s.  \nThey did not. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \n \n \n\n58 \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nAdam K.

This latest observation, which reflects an internal reasoning process, does not introduce new external evidence but serves to validate my current belief state and sharpen my focus on the most critical missing information.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable):** My belief that the United States' case hinges on framing Tennessee's SB1 as sex discrimination subject to heightened scrutiny remains unchanged and is now a confirmed cornerstone of my analysis.\n    *   **Mechanism of Discrimination:** The law is facially discriminatory because it regulates medical care (e.g., prescribing testosterone) based on a minor's sex assigned at birth relative to their gender identity.\n    *   **Key Precedents:** The petitioner's reliance on *Bostock v. Clayton County*, *United States v. Virginia (VMI)*, and *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* to establish the sex-based classification is a stable and central part of my understanding.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Alternative Argument (Stable):** The secondary argument that the law discriminates against transgender individuals as a class, warranting heightened scrutiny under a *City of Cleburne* rationale, also remains a stable part of my belief state.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's \"Failing Scrutiny\" Argument (Stable):** My understanding of how the U.S. argues SB1 fails heightened scrutiny is firm. The state's interest is framed as impermissible stereotyping, and the law's structure is attacked as both underinclusive (permitting other risky procedures for minors) and overinclusive (imposing a categorical ban that ignores individualized medical necessity).\n\n4.  **Factual Basis (Stable):** The factual pillars of the petitioner's case remain clear: the consensus of major medical organizations on the standard of care for gender dysphoria, the seriousness of the condition, and the assertion that the benefits of care outweigh the risks cited by the state.\n\n5.  **Confirmation of Analytical Path (New Belief/Refinement):** The latest observation confirms that my analysis of the petitioner's brief is complete and that my predictive model is correctly structured. The central conflict is the petitioner's heightened scrutiny framework versus the respondent's counter-framework. This observation solidifies my strategy: the single most important piece of evidence needed to advance my prediction is the respondent's (Tennessee's) brief on the merits. My uncertainty is now precisely targeted. I need to know:\n    *   How will Tennessee rebut the claim that SB1 is a form of sex discrimination? Will they attempt to distinguish *Bostock* as a statutory (Title VII) case not applicable to the Equal Protection Clause?\n    *   What level of scrutiny will Tennessee argue is appropriate? They will almost certainly advocate for rational basis review, aligning with the Sixth Circuit's decision.\n    *   How will Tennessee define its governmental interests? I anticipate arguments centered on protecting minors from \"experimental\" and \"irreversible\" procedures, questioning the medical consensus, and asserting the state's traditional authority to regulate medicine and protect children.\n\nMy belief state has evolved from understanding one side's argument to having a confirmed and focused strategy for discovering the other. The path to a more confident prediction is no longer about general research but about acquiring a specific, known document: the respondent's brief.",

My understanding has evolved from analyzing one side of the case to mapping the entire legal battlefield.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Central Conflict\u2014The Nature of the Classification (Refined and Confirmed):** The core legal dispute is now sharply defined. The petitioner (United States) argues SB1 is a facial sex classification subject to heightened scrutiny, while the respondent (Tennessee) argues it is a regulation of medical procedures based on age and purpose, subject only to rational basis review.\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** The law is a sex-based classification because it determines the legality of a medical treatment (e.g., prescribing testosterone) based on the congruence between a minor's sex at birth and their gender identity. This relies on precedents like *Bostock*, *VMI*, and *Morales-Santana*.\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Argument (New Belief):** Tennessee directly refutes this, arguing SB1 \"draws no sex-based line.\" Their argument, detailed in their brief, is that the law regulates specific interventions (puberty blockers, hormones) for a specific *purpose* (gender transition), not based on sex itself. They contend that boys and girls fall on both sides of the line, as the law restricts these procedures for gender transition for everyone under 18 but permits them for other medical reasons (e.g., precocious puberty). They assert that under precedents like *Geduldig v. Aiello*, a law is not a sex classification simply because it affects a condition unique to one sex or gender identity.\n\n2.  **The Role of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (Refined and Confirmed):** The applicability of *Bostock*'s reasoning is a primary point of contention, and I now have both sides' arguments.\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation logic (that discrimination against a transgender person is inherently discrimination \"because of sex\") applies directly to the Equal Protection Clause.\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Argument (New Belief):** Tennessee argues forcefully that *Bostock* must be confined to its statutory context (Title VII). They state, \"This Court has never taken a but-for approach to equal-protection classifications.\" They argue that the controlling Equal Protection precedent is *Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. v. Feeney*, which requires proof of discriminatory *purpose*, not just but-for causation. They warn that constitutionalizing *Bostock*'s test would be a \"doctrinal revolution\" that could \"subvert sex-based review\" and undermine existing sex-specific protections for women.\n\n3.  **The \"Similarly Situated\" Debate (New Belief):** Tennessee introduces a classic Equal Protection argument that was not prominent in my prior understanding.\n    *   **Respondent's Argument (New Belief):** In Section II.B of their brief, they argue that even if the law were a sex classification, boys and girls are not \"similarly situated\" with respect to the regulated procedures. Citing cases like *Nguyen v. INS* and *Michael M. v. Superior Court*, they contend that the inherent biological differences between males and females are directly relevant to the risks and effects of the specific hormones and puberty blockers being regulated, justifying different treatment.\n\n4.  **The Standard of Review (Refined and Confirmed):** My prediction that Tennessee would advocate for rational basis review is confirmed, and I now understand their multi-layered strategy.\n    *   **Primary Argument (New Belief):** Tennessee's main line of attack (Arguments II and III) is to defeat the application of heightened scrutiny altogether by arguing SB1 contains no sex or transgender classification.\n    *   **Alternative Argument (New Belief):** As a fallback, Tennessee argues in Section IV that SB1 survives *any* level of scrutiny, including heightened scrutiny. This \"belt-and-suspenders\" approach is a key part of their strategy.\n\n5.  **The State's Governmental Interest (Refined and Confirmed):** My hypothesis about how Tennessee would frame its interests is confirmed and significantly fleshed out by their brief.\n    *   **Petitioner's Framing (Stable):** The state's interest is an impermissible desire to enforce sex stereotypes.\n    *   **Respondent's Framing (New Belief):** Tennessee defines its interest as exercising its traditional police power to protect public health and shield minors from \"life-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition interventions.\" They directly challenge the petitioner's \"medical consensus\" narrative by:\n        *   **Citing International Precedent:** Heavily referencing the pullback on these treatments in European countries and citing the UK's Cass Review as evidence of a lack of quality data and emerging safety concerns.\n        *   **Highlighting \"Medical and Scientific Uncertainty\":** Framing the debate as a \"live medical dispute.\" They lean heavily on the precedent of *Gonzales v. Carhart*, arguing that legislatures have \"wide discretion\" to regulate in areas of medical uncertainty, even when fundamental rights are implicated.\n        *   **Emphasizing Risks:** Detailing the risks of infertility, diminished bone density, and other harms from puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.\n\nMy belief state has now fully integrated the arguments from both parties. The central predictive questions for the Court are no longer hypothetical. They are: 1) Will the Court import *Bostock*'s but-for causation test into the Equal Protection Clause, or will it maintain the *Feeney* purpose-based standard? 2) Is this law a regulation of medical *purpose* (per *Geduldig* and *Vacco v. Quill*) or a classification based on *sex* (per *VMI*)? and 3) How much deference will the Court grant the legislature under the *Gonzales v. Carhart* \"medical uncertainty\" framework? My predictive task now shifts from information gathering to analyzing how specific justices are likely to resolve these precise precedential conflicts.",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n194: 20241015102831480_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.374)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n7: 20241015102823960_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.374)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \non social media and, while in hospital, to con-\ntact likeminded people and ask when they will \nbe admitted to the clinic. \nMy view is that gender dysphoria in children \nand young adults is largely explained as a so-\ncial contagion. A slight increase in prevalence \nstarted in 2007, when the first smartphone was \nlaunched. However, it took a few years before \nthe majority of teenagers had a smartphone, \nand this coincides quite well with the sharp in-\ncrease in the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in \nyoung people. American journalist Abigail \nSchrier's book Irreversible Damage: The \nTransgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters \n(2020) provides a vivid and detailed account of \nthe social contagion of gender dysphoria. \n4.CR.1630\u201331. \n\n14 \n \n6. Treatment of adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is a developing field. The \nprohibited treatments are experimental, \nand no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits. \nDr. Cantor, expert for Texas, testified that although \n\u201cwe have outcome studies on the childhood onset type \nand we have outcome studies on the adult onset type, we \nhave absolutely no data, we have no outcome studies on \nthis -- what I\u2019ll call the adolescent onset type even though \nthey are now suddenly the large majority of people com-\ning into clinics.\u201d 3.RR.108. \nHe also testified that there are \u201cvarious levels of evi-\ndence going from low-quality evidence that are relatively \nuncertain or ambiguous up through high-quality evi-\ndence that is highly reliable and worth generalizing to \nother people.\u201d 3.RR.83. \u201c[L]ow-quality studies are very \nnumerous in the research literature exactly because or \nas a side effect of their being easy to perform, but they're \nless reliable. The more systematic and the more reliable \nstudies are harder to perform, take more time to per-\nform, and take much more thorough analysis, so there \nare fewer of them.\u201d 3.RR.86. The highest-quality studies \nare \u201csystematic reviews which review all the other stud-\nies beneath it assessing them according to their relative \nqualities.\u201d Id. \nDr. Cantor testified that the \u201cgreat majority of the \nstudies [relied on by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts] were sur-\nveys.\u201d Surveys \u201care very, very common because it\u2019s so \neasy to conduct a survey, for example, on the Internet. \nSurveys can, you know, help us give, you know -- help us \nproduce hypotheses, can help give us ideas, but they \ndon't represent evidence at all\u2026. [T]hey can give us a \ngood idea of questions to look at, but they don't represent \n\n15 \n \nany kind of outcomes evidence.\u201d 3.RR.95. Surveys \u201cdon\u2019t \ncount as medical evidence, they don't count as outcome \nevidence, but the conclusions of the [plaintiffs\u2019] experts \ndepended largely on what doesn't count as evidence.\u201d \n3.RR.96. \nThe lowest-quality evidence comes from \u201ccase stud-\nies and reports,\u201d which \u201care generally retrospective \nstudies where somebody would go through hospital rec-\nords, for example, pull out cases of specific diagnoses and \nsee what happened amongst those people. It gives -- it \ncan give some idea of what to expect if nothing is done, \nbut because these are not systematic, they're not yet \nready for any kind of generalization to other cases.\u201d \n3.RR.90. \u201c[T]here have been a handful [of case studies \nabout the prohibited procedures on minors] published \nover the years. But again, they generally came out with \nambiguous -- with ambiguous results but results that, \nagain, suggested that it was at least worth looking at \nmore systematically.\u201d 3.RR.97\u201398. \nHigher quality evidence comes from \u201ccase-controlled \nstudies,\u201d which are \u201clooking for patterns of what hap-\npens in different groups of people or what makes differ-\nent groups of people different from each other.\u201d \n3.RR.90\u201391. Dr. Cantor is only aware of one such study, \nwhich was \u201ca particularly low-quality study because we \ncan\u2019t tell, you know, what changes, you know, what im-\nprovements and, you know, what got worse amongst \nthese people\u201d and \u201c[t]hey were in a poor mental health \nstatus to begin with.\u201d 3.RR.98. \nThe next highest-quality evidence is \u201ccohort studies,\u201d \nin which \u201cwe\u2019re now checking on a single group of people \nbut over time. We\u2019re looking to see what happened, for \nexample, before or after they were exposed to a treat-\nment or exposed to some not just substance. So instead \n\n16 \n \nof just taking a look at them at one point in time, we\u2019re \ntaking the same group of people and looking at them over \nseveral groups of time.\u201d 3.RR.91. \u201cThere have been ex-\nactly 13 [cohort studies], and these are the 13 that I sum-\nmarize in my own report. This is the highest level study \nthat so far has been conducted at all for the medical tran-\nsition of minors.\u201d 3.RR.99. \n\u201c[F]our of [the cohort studies] showed essentially no \nimprovement at all.\u201d 3.RR.100. In \u201croughly six of them, \nthere were some improvements in some mental health \nparameters, but we can\u2019t conclude that it was the inter-\nvention, that it was the medical interventions itself that \ncaused the improvement because the people were get-\nting psychotherapy at the same time.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]here were \ntwo studies which were designed in a way that allowed \nmore direct comparison trying to allocate how much of \nthe improvement was due to the medical interventions \nversus how much of the improvement was due to the \nmental health interventions. And both of those demon-\nstrate -- and both of those failed to demonstrate that the \nmedical interventions produced any more benefit than \ndid the mental health -- the psychotherapeutic interven-\ntions.\u201d 3.RR.100-01. \u201cAnd there was one other very re-\ncent study that just did not indicate whether the people \nwere in psychotherapy at the same time, so the results -\n- we can\u2019t assess whether the medical interventions were \nsuperior because we don't know how many were getting \npsychotherapy at the same time.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nThe next highest level of evidence comes from \u201cran-\ndomized controlled trials[, which] are the ones where we \ntake a group of people, randomly assign which ones are \ngoing to receive the experimental treatment and which \nones are going to receive either no treatment or some \nother comparison treatment such as treatment as usual, \n\n17 \n \na placebo treatment, or some other -- some other inter-\nvention.\u201d 3.RR.92. There have not been any randomized \ncontrol studies of the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.101. \nThe highest-level evidence comes from systematic re-\nviews, which \u201canalyze all of the studies and all of the lay-\ners that were beneath it. Again, especially in large fields \nwith many people, there are many, many studies, and es-\npecially for very busy clinicians, it\u2019s not possible to read \nand integrate every single one. So the purpose of system-\natic reviews is to get the big picture of what all of the \nother studies have shown, but as I say, to do it in a sys-\ntematic way that removes the potential for bias. The big-\ngest bias, as I mentioned, was cherry-picking where peo-\nple pick out the positive studies but don't mention the \nstudies where the experiment failed.\u201d 3.R.93\u201394. \u201cThere \nhave now been several systematic reviews, none con-\nducted in the U.S. They've all been conducted by the na-\ntional public healthcare systems in Europe.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nEach of them concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to sug-\ngest that medicalized interventions provides any benefits \nsuperior to the mental health interventions.\u201d 3.RR.102. \n\u201cEach of the systematic reviews came to the same con-\nclusion, that the evidence for benefits are outweighed by \nthe evidence of the risks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. Those \nharms include, sterilization, permanent loss of capacity \nto breast-feed, inability to orgasm and loss of sexual \nfunction, interference with neurological and cognitive de-\nvelopment, elevated risk of Parkinsonism, and reduced \nbone density. 4.CR.1220\u201325. \nIn short, there is no evidence that the prohibited pro-\ncedures are safe and effective to treat minors with gen-\nder dysphoria. The prohibited procedures have \u201cnot yet \nbeen tested with experimental studies, so it\u2019s necessarily \nstill within the experimental status.\u201d 3.RR.116. \n\n18 \n \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \nDr. Cantor\u2019s testimony is consistent with the Cass \nReport, 5 a study recently commissioned by the National \nHealth Service in the United Kingdom to evaluate the \nsafety and efficacy of puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \nThe authors of Cass Report spent four years reviewing \nclinical data, interviewing patients and providers, and \nconducting six systematic reviews. It concluded, among \nother things, the following:  \n\u2022 Gender Dysphoria: a diagnosis of gender dyspho-\nria is \u201cnot reliably predictive of whether that \nyoung person will have longstanding gender in-\ncongruence in the future, or whether medical in-\ntervention will be the best option for them.\u201d Cass \nReport at 29. \n\u2022 Social Transition: there is \u201cno clear evidence \nthat social transition in childhood has any positive \nor negative mental health outcomes, and rela-\ntively weak evidence for any effect in adoles-\ncence.\u201d Id. at 31. \n\u2022 Puberty Blockers: the use of puberty blockers \nresulted in \u201cno changes in gender dysphoria or \nbody satisfaction\u201d and there is \u201cinsufficient/incon-\nsistent evidence about the effects of puberty sup-\npression on psychological or psychosocial wellbe-\ning, cognitive development, cardio-metabolic risk \nor fertility \u2026 there is no evidence that puberty \nblockers buy time to think, and some concern that \n \n5 Hilary Cass, M.D., Independent Review of Gender Identity \nServices for Children and Young Adults, National Health Services \nEngland (Apr. 2024) (the \u201cCass Report\u201d), available at https://ti-\nnyurl.com/mw4s3arn. \n\n19 \n \nthey may change the trajectory of psychosexual \nand gender identity development.\u201d Id. at 32. \n\u2022 Cross-Sex Hormones: \u201c[t]here is a lack of high-\nquality research assessing the outcomes of hor-\nmone interventions in adolescents with gender \ndysphoria/incongruence, and few studies that un-\ndertake long-term follow-up. No conclusions can \nbe drawn about the effect on gender dysphoria, \nbody satisfaction, psychosocial health, cognitive \ndevelopment, or fertility [from the use of cross-\nsex hormones]. Uncertainty remains about the \noutcomes for height/growth, cardiometabolic and \nbone health.\u201d Id. at 33. \n\u2022 Suicides: \u201cIt has been suggested that hormone \ntreatment reduces the elevated risk of death by \nsuicide in this population, but the evidence found \ndid not support this conclusion.\u201d Id. \n7. The risks of the prohibited procedures \noutweigh the benefits. \nAs noted, Dr. Cantor testified, \u201cEach of the system-\natic reviews came to the same conclusion, that the evi-\ndence for benefits are outweighed by the evidence of the \nrisks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. \nDr. Rom\u00e1n, expert for Texas, testified that the \u201cSwe-\ndish National Board of Health and Welfare concluded \nthat \u2018the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming \ntreatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits of \nthese treatments.\u2019\u201d 4.CR.1637. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, also testified, \u201cThe po-\ntential benefits [of providing puberty blockers to minors] \ndo not outweigh the risks,\u201d 3.RR.37\u201338, and that \u201cthe \nbenefits do not outweigh the risks for cross-sex hor-\nmones for adolescents,\u201d 3.RR.52. \n\n20 \n \n8. Minors cannot give informed consent to \nthe prohibited procedures. \nDr. Geeta Nangia, a child and adolescent psychia-\ntrist, testified as an expert for Texas. She testified that \n\u201cminors lack the necessary neurological, psychosocial, \nand cognitive development to provide informed consent \nor assent to\u201d the prohibited procedures. 4.CR.1452\u201385. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that minors \nhave very limited capacity to understand the implica-\ntions of taking potentially life-altering puberty blockers \nor cross-sex hormones. 3.RR.54\u201357. \nDr. Alan Hopewell, a clinical psychologist and neuro-\npsychologist, testified as an expert for Texas that minors \nhave limited reasoning ability and cannot give informed \nconsent to the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.186\u201390. \n9. Therapy is effective. \nDr. Nangia, expert for Texas, \u201ctreat[s] her patients \nwith exploratory, supportive, and family therapy,\u201d and \ntestified that \u201cchildren with gender dysphoria benefit \ntremendously from therapy\u2014particularly psychody-\nnamic therapy.\u201d 4.CR.1447\u201349. \nDr. Taylor, expert for Texas, testified that psycho-\ntherapy is a safe and effective treatment for minors with \ngender dysphoria. 3.RR.144. She testified that minors \nwith gender dysphoria or confusion is a symptom of the \nfamily dynamic and that dysfunction in the family system \nneeds to be addressed to resolve their feelings of gender \ndysphoria and confusion. 3.RR.143\u201344. \n \n* * * \nIn sum, the district court did not and could not have \nannounced as a matter of legislative fact (\u201cestablished \ntruths, facts, or pronouncements that do not change from \ncase to case but apply universally,\u201d Gould, 536 F.2d at \n\n21 \n \n220) that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria.\u201d And the evidence set for \nthis question should not be closed. Evidence such as that \npresented in Texas\u2019s defense of its statute similar to SB1 \nand the Cass report needs to be considered before the \nCourt can announce any legislative fact about the prohib-\nited procedures. \n \n \n \n \n\n22 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. But if the Court remands this case, it should not \nannounce that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully \nimprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria\u201d as a matter of settled, \nundisputed legislative fact. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nRALPH MOLINA \nDeputy First Assistant \n  Attorney General \nAUSTIN KINGHORN \nDeputy Attorney General \n  for Legal Strategy \nOCTOBER 15, 2024 \nCHARLES K.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a \"THINK\" action, representing an internal strategic decision rather than the receipt of new external evidence about the case. As such, it does not introduce new facts, legal arguments, or signals that would alter my substantive understanding of the case's legal landscape. My task-level beliefs therefore remain stable and are preserved from the previous state. The observation confirms my strategy to next analyze amicus curiae briefs, starting with those in support of the respondent, to deepen my understanding of the arguments I have just processed.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs, which are stable following this observation, are:\n\n1.  **Central Conflict\u2014Nature of the Classification (Stable):** The primary legal battle is clearly delineated. The United States argues SB1 is a facial sex classification subject to heightened scrutiny, while Tennessee contends it is a regulation of specific medical procedures based on their purpose (gender transition) and the age of the patient, warranting only rational basis review.\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** The law is sex-based because the legality of prescribing a hormone like testosterone depends on whether the minor's sex at birth aligns with their gender identity, invoking precedents like *Bostock*, *VMI*, and *Morales-Santana*.\n    *   **Respondent's View (Stable):** The law is not a sex-based classification. It regulates specific interventions for a specific *purpose* (gender transition) for all minors, regardless of sex. They argue this is analogous to *Geduldig v. Aiello*, where a law affecting a condition unique to one sex was not deemed a sex-based classification.\n\n2.  **The Role of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (Stable):** The applicability of *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test to the Equal Protection Clause is a critical point of disagreement.\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** *Bostock*'s logic applies directly.\n    *   **Respondent's View (Stable):** *Bostock* is a Title VII statutory interpretation case and should not be constitutionalized. The controlling Equal Protection precedent is *Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. v. Feeney*, which requires proof of discriminatory *purpose*, not just effect or but-for causation. They warn that extending *Bostock* would be a \"doctrinal revolution.\"\n\n3.  **The \"Similarly Situated\" Debate (Stable):** Tennessee has introduced a classic Equal Protection defense.\n    *   **Respondent's Argument (Stable):** Even if the law is a sex classification, boys and girls are not \"similarly situated\" regarding the risks and effects of cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers. They cite *Nguyen v. INS* and *Michael M. v. Superior Court* to argue that inherent biological differences can justify different treatment under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n4.  **The Standard of Review (Stable):** Tennessee's multi-pronged strategy for the standard of review is now clear.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Stable):** The law is not a sex or transgender classification, so rational basis review applies.\n    *   **Alternative Argument (Stable):** As a fallback, the law survives even heightened scrutiny because the state's interests are exceedingly important.\n\n5.  **The State's Governmental Interest (Stable):** Tennessee's justification for the law is now fully articulated, moving beyond hypothesis.\n    *   **Respondent's Framing (Stable):** The state is exercising its traditional police power to protect minors from the \"life-altering risks\" of \"uncertain gender-transition interventions.\" This argument is supported by:\n        *   **International Precedent:** Citing the Cass Review in the UK and policy shifts in other European nations to counter the \"medical consensus\" narrative.\n        *   **Medical Uncertainty Doctrine:** Framing the issue as a \"live medical dispute\" and invoking *Gonzales v. Carhart* to argue for legislative deference in areas of scientific uncertainty.\n        *   **Specific Risks:** Highlighting potential harms like infertility and reduced bone density.\n\nMy current belief state is a comprehensive map of the direct legal conflict between the petitioner and the respondent. The predictive challenge remains centered on how the Court will resolve these specific precedential clashes: 1) *Bostock* vs. *Feeney* on the Equal Protection standard; 2) *Geduldig* vs. *VMI* on the nature of the classification; and 3) the scope of legislative deference under *Gonzales v. Carhart*'s \"medical uncertainty\" framework. My next step, as outlined in the THINK observation, is to seek out amicus briefs that will add depth and texture to these core arguments.",

The Texas brief was highly informative, introducing a detailed evidentiary challenge to the 'medical consensus' narrative and a sophisticated procedural argument against the Court establishing a 'legislative fact' based on a preliminary injunction record. This 'medical uncertainty' off-ramp seems like a powerful argument for judicial deference. My understanding of the respondent's case is now quite deep. To balance this, I need to gather equivalent information from the petitioner's side. I must understand how their allies, particularly major medical and civil rights organizations, counter the 'medical uncertainty' argument and reinforce the claim that this is straightforward sex discrimination under Bostock. The most direct way to do this is to search for amicus briefs filed in support of the petitioner.",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the amicus curiae brief from the State of Texas in support of the respondents provides a significant infusion of new evidence and a novel legal-procedural argument. It substantially deepens my understanding of the respondent's strategy, particularly by putting detailed, specific claims behind the \"medical uncertainty\" defense. My beliefs are updated to incorporate this new, detailed evidentiary narrative and the new procedural argument it introduces.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n1.  **Central Conflict\u2014Nature of the Classification (Stable):** The core legal disagreement remains whether SB1 is a facial sex classification (*Petitioner's view*) or a regulation of specific medical procedures for a specific purpose (*Respondent's view*). The Texas brief does not alter this fundamental legal clash but provides factual arguments (e.g., gender dysphoria as a purely mental condition) intended to support the respondent's framing.\n\n2.  **The Role of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (Stable):** The precedential conflict between *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test and *Feeney*'s discriminatory *purpose* requirement for Equal Protection claims remains a central, unresolved legal question. The Texas brief does not focus on this doctrinal issue, instead concentrating on the factual predicate for the law.\n\n3.  **The \"Similarly Situated\" Debate (Stable but Reinforced):** The respondent's argument that boys and girls are not \"similarly situated\" regarding these treatments is stable. The Texas brief reinforces this by introducing expert testimony asserting that biological sex is binary and immutable, providing a factual basis for the state to argue that inherent biological differences are the basis for the law's distinctions.\n\n4.  **The Standard of Review (Updated and Deepened):** My understanding of the arguments against heightened scrutiny has deepened. Beyond the legal argument to limit *Bostock*, the Texas brief provides a factual assault on the potential classification of \"transgender status\" as a quasi-suspect class.\n    *   **New Factual Challenge to Suspect Class Status:** The brief introduces evidence and expert testimony arguing that gender identity is not an immutable characteristic and can change over time. It also posits that \"adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a new phenomenon, potentially driven by \"social contagion.\" These claims directly attack the traditional criteria (e.g., immutability) the Court uses to identify suspect or quasi-suspect classes, thereby strengthening the argument that only rational basis review should apply.\n\n5.  **The State's Governmental Interest & Medical Uncertainty (Significantly Updated and Elaborated):** My prior belief was that Tennessee was invoking the \"medical uncertainty\" doctrine from *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Texas brief transforms this from a legal strategy into a detailed, evidence-based narrative. It provides a comprehensive counter-narrative to the petitioner's claim of a \"medical consensus.\"\n    *   **New Evidentiary Support:** The brief marshals a specific set of claims, purportedly backed by expert testimony from a parallel case in Texas (`Loe v. State`), to establish profound scientific dispute. These claims include:\n        *   Gender dysphoria is a \"purely a mental condition\" with no biological test.\n        *   \"Adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a recent, novel phenomenon, distinct from historical presentations and not yet in the DSM-V.\n        *   The rise in cases is a \"social contagion,\" particularly among teenage girls.\n        *   The prohibited treatments are \"experimental,\" lack high-quality evidentiary support for their benefits, and their risks (e.g., infertility) outweigh the benefits.\n        *   Safer, effective alternatives like psychotherapy exist.\n    *   **International Precedent:** The brief continues to cite the Cass Review from the UK as a key piece of evidence that other Western health systems are moving away from the \"gender-affirming\" model due to a lack of evidence.\n\n6.  **The \"Legislative Fact\" Argument (New Belief):** The Texas brief introduces a novel and sophisticated procedural argument. It urges the Court to avoid establishing a \"legislative fact\"\u2014a universally applicable truth\u2014that these medical procedures are safe and effective.\n    *   **Argument for Judicial Restraint:** Texas argues that the district court's findings were explicitly preliminary and based on a limited record, and that the US government is mischaracterizing them as settled science. It contends that the \"evidence set should not yet be closed.\"\n    *   **Predictive Significance:** This provides the Court with a potential off-ramp. The justices could rule in favor of Tennessee not by declaring the treatments harmful, but by concluding that the science is too unsettled for the judiciary to declare a constitutional right based on their efficacy. This reframes the question from \"Is this care beneficial?\" to \"Should the Court, on this record, prevent a legislature from acting in the face of scientific uncertainty?\" This pathway strongly favors a posture of judicial deference to the legislature.",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n194: 20241015102831480_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.438)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n7: 20241015102823960_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.438)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \non social media and, while in hospital, to con-\ntact likeminded people and ask when they will \nbe admitted to the clinic. \nMy view is that gender dysphoria in children \nand young adults is largely explained as a so-\ncial contagion. A slight increase in prevalence \nstarted in 2007, when the first smartphone was \nlaunched. However, it took a few years before \nthe majority of teenagers had a smartphone, \nand this coincides quite well with the sharp in-\ncrease in the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in \nyoung people. American journalist Abigail \nSchrier's book Irreversible Damage: The \nTransgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters \n(2020) provides a vivid and detailed account of \nthe social contagion of gender dysphoria. \n4.CR.1630\u201331. \n\n14 \n \n6. Treatment of adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is a developing field. The \nprohibited treatments are experimental, \nand no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits. \nDr. Cantor, expert for Texas, testified that although \n\u201cwe have outcome studies on the childhood onset type \nand we have outcome studies on the adult onset type, we \nhave absolutely no data, we have no outcome studies on \nthis -- what I\u2019ll call the adolescent onset type even though \nthey are now suddenly the large majority of people com-\ning into clinics.\u201d 3.RR.108. \nHe also testified that there are \u201cvarious levels of evi-\ndence going from low-quality evidence that are relatively \nuncertain or ambiguous up through high-quality evi-\ndence that is highly reliable and worth generalizing to \nother people.\u201d 3.RR.83. \u201c[L]ow-quality studies are very \nnumerous in the research literature exactly because or \nas a side effect of their being easy to perform, but they're \nless reliable. The more systematic and the more reliable \nstudies are harder to perform, take more time to per-\nform, and take much more thorough analysis, so there \nare fewer of them.\u201d 3.RR.86. The highest-quality studies \nare \u201csystematic reviews which review all the other stud-\nies beneath it assessing them according to their relative \nqualities.\u201d Id. \nDr. Cantor testified that the \u201cgreat majority of the \nstudies [relied on by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts] were sur-\nveys.\u201d Surveys \u201care very, very common because it\u2019s so \neasy to conduct a survey, for example, on the Internet. \nSurveys can, you know, help us give, you know -- help us \nproduce hypotheses, can help give us ideas, but they \ndon't represent evidence at all\u2026. [T]hey can give us a \ngood idea of questions to look at, but they don't represent \n\n15 \n \nany kind of outcomes evidence.\u201d 3.RR.95. Surveys \u201cdon\u2019t \ncount as medical evidence, they don't count as outcome \nevidence, but the conclusions of the [plaintiffs\u2019] experts \ndepended largely on what doesn't count as evidence.\u201d \n3.RR.96. \nThe lowest-quality evidence comes from \u201ccase stud-\nies and reports,\u201d which \u201care generally retrospective \nstudies where somebody would go through hospital rec-\nords, for example, pull out cases of specific diagnoses and \nsee what happened amongst those people. It gives -- it \ncan give some idea of what to expect if nothing is done, \nbut because these are not systematic, they're not yet \nready for any kind of generalization to other cases.\u201d \n3.RR.90. \u201c[T]here have been a handful [of case studies \nabout the prohibited procedures on minors] published \nover the years. But again, they generally came out with \nambiguous -- with ambiguous results but results that, \nagain, suggested that it was at least worth looking at \nmore systematically.\u201d 3.RR.97\u201398. \nHigher quality evidence comes from \u201ccase-controlled \nstudies,\u201d which are \u201clooking for patterns of what hap-\npens in different groups of people or what makes differ-\nent groups of people different from each other.\u201d \n3.RR.90\u201391. Dr. Cantor is only aware of one such study, \nwhich was \u201ca particularly low-quality study because we \ncan\u2019t tell, you know, what changes, you know, what im-\nprovements and, you know, what got worse amongst \nthese people\u201d and \u201c[t]hey were in a poor mental health \nstatus to begin with.\u201d 3.RR.98. \nThe next highest-quality evidence is \u201ccohort studies,\u201d \nin which \u201cwe\u2019re now checking on a single group of people \nbut over time. We\u2019re looking to see what happened, for \nexample, before or after they were exposed to a treat-\nment or exposed to some not just substance. So instead \n\n16 \n \nof just taking a look at them at one point in time, we\u2019re \ntaking the same group of people and looking at them over \nseveral groups of time.\u201d 3.RR.91. \u201cThere have been ex-\nactly 13 [cohort studies], and these are the 13 that I sum-\nmarize in my own report. This is the highest level study \nthat so far has been conducted at all for the medical tran-\nsition of minors.\u201d 3.RR.99. \n\u201c[F]our of [the cohort studies] showed essentially no \nimprovement at all.\u201d 3.RR.100. In \u201croughly six of them, \nthere were some improvements in some mental health \nparameters, but we can\u2019t conclude that it was the inter-\nvention, that it was the medical interventions itself that \ncaused the improvement because the people were get-\nting psychotherapy at the same time.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]here were \ntwo studies which were designed in a way that allowed \nmore direct comparison trying to allocate how much of \nthe improvement was due to the medical interventions \nversus how much of the improvement was due to the \nmental health interventions. And both of those demon-\nstrate -- and both of those failed to demonstrate that the \nmedical interventions produced any more benefit than \ndid the mental health -- the psychotherapeutic interven-\ntions.\u201d 3.RR.100-01. \u201cAnd there was one other very re-\ncent study that just did not indicate whether the people \nwere in psychotherapy at the same time, so the results -\n- we can\u2019t assess whether the medical interventions were \nsuperior because we don't know how many were getting \npsychotherapy at the same time.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nThe next highest level of evidence comes from \u201cran-\ndomized controlled trials[, which] are the ones where we \ntake a group of people, randomly assign which ones are \ngoing to receive the experimental treatment and which \nones are going to receive either no treatment or some \nother comparison treatment such as treatment as usual, \n\n17 \n \na placebo treatment, or some other -- some other inter-\nvention.\u201d 3.RR.92. There have not been any randomized \ncontrol studies of the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.101. \nThe highest-level evidence comes from systematic re-\nviews, which \u201canalyze all of the studies and all of the lay-\ners that were beneath it. Again, especially in large fields \nwith many people, there are many, many studies, and es-\npecially for very busy clinicians, it\u2019s not possible to read \nand integrate every single one. So the purpose of system-\natic reviews is to get the big picture of what all of the \nother studies have shown, but as I say, to do it in a sys-\ntematic way that removes the potential for bias. The big-\ngest bias, as I mentioned, was cherry-picking where peo-\nple pick out the positive studies but don't mention the \nstudies where the experiment failed.\u201d 3.R.93\u201394. \u201cThere \nhave now been several systematic reviews, none con-\nducted in the U.S. They've all been conducted by the na-\ntional public healthcare systems in Europe.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nEach of them concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to sug-\ngest that medicalized interventions provides any benefits \nsuperior to the mental health interventions.\u201d 3.RR.102. \n\u201cEach of the systematic reviews came to the same con-\nclusion, that the evidence for benefits are outweighed by \nthe evidence of the risks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. Those \nharms include, sterilization, permanent loss of capacity \nto breast-feed, inability to orgasm and loss of sexual \nfunction, interference with neurological and cognitive de-\nvelopment, elevated risk of Parkinsonism, and reduced \nbone density. 4.CR.1220\u201325. \nIn short, there is no evidence that the prohibited pro-\ncedures are safe and effective to treat minors with gen-\nder dysphoria. The prohibited procedures have \u201cnot yet \nbeen tested with experimental studies, so it\u2019s necessarily \nstill within the experimental status.\u201d 3.RR.116. \n\n18 \n \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \nDr. Cantor\u2019s testimony is consistent with the Cass \nReport, 5 a study recently commissioned by the National \nHealth Service in the United Kingdom to evaluate the \nsafety and efficacy of puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \nThe authors of Cass Report spent four years reviewing \nclinical data, interviewing patients and providers, and \nconducting six systematic reviews. It concluded, among \nother things, the following:  \n\u2022 Gender Dysphoria: a diagnosis of gender dyspho-\nria is \u201cnot reliably predictive of whether that \nyoung person will have longstanding gender in-\ncongruence in the future, or whether medical in-\ntervention will be the best option for them.\u201d Cass \nReport at 29. \n\u2022 Social Transition: there is \u201cno clear evidence \nthat social transition in childhood has any positive \nor negative mental health outcomes, and rela-\ntively weak evidence for any effect in adoles-\ncence.\u201d Id. at 31. \n\u2022 Puberty Blockers: the use of puberty blockers \nresulted in \u201cno changes in gender dysphoria or \nbody satisfaction\u201d and there is \u201cinsufficient/incon-\nsistent evidence about the effects of puberty sup-\npression on psychological or psychosocial wellbe-\ning, cognitive development, cardio-metabolic risk \nor fertility \u2026 there is no evidence that puberty \nblockers buy time to think, and some concern that \n \n5 Hilary Cass, M.D., Independent Review of Gender Identity \nServices for Children and Young Adults, National Health Services \nEngland (Apr. 2024) (the \u201cCass Report\u201d), available at https://ti-\nnyurl.com/mw4s3arn. \n\n19 \n \nthey may change the trajectory of psychosexual \nand gender identity development.\u201d Id. at 32. \n\u2022 Cross-Sex Hormones: \u201c[t]here is a lack of high-\nquality research assessing the outcomes of hor-\nmone interventions in adolescents with gender \ndysphoria/incongruence, and few studies that un-\ndertake long-term follow-up. No conclusions can \nbe drawn about the effect on gender dysphoria, \nbody satisfaction, psychosocial health, cognitive \ndevelopment, or fertility [from the use of cross-\nsex hormones]. Uncertainty remains about the \noutcomes for height/growth, cardiometabolic and \nbone health.\u201d Id. at 33. \n\u2022 Suicides: \u201cIt has been suggested that hormone \ntreatment reduces the elevated risk of death by \nsuicide in this population, but the evidence found \ndid not support this conclusion.\u201d Id. \n7. The risks of the prohibited procedures \noutweigh the benefits. \nAs noted, Dr. Cantor testified, \u201cEach of the system-\natic reviews came to the same conclusion, that the evi-\ndence for benefits are outweighed by the evidence of the \nrisks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. \nDr. Rom\u00e1n, expert for Texas, testified that the \u201cSwe-\ndish National Board of Health and Welfare concluded \nthat \u2018the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming \ntreatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits of \nthese treatments.\u2019\u201d 4.CR.1637. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, also testified, \u201cThe po-\ntential benefits [of providing puberty blockers to minors] \ndo not outweigh the risks,\u201d 3.RR.37\u201338, and that \u201cthe \nbenefits do not outweigh the risks for cross-sex hor-\nmones for adolescents,\u201d 3.RR.52. \n\n20 \n \n8. Minors cannot give informed consent to \nthe prohibited procedures. \nDr. Geeta Nangia, a child and adolescent psychia-\ntrist, testified as an expert for Texas. She testified that \n\u201cminors lack the necessary neurological, psychosocial, \nand cognitive development to provide informed consent \nor assent to\u201d the prohibited procedures. 4.CR.1452\u201385. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that minors \nhave very limited capacity to understand the implica-\ntions of taking potentially life-altering puberty blockers \nor cross-sex hormones. 3.RR.54\u201357. \nDr. Alan Hopewell, a clinical psychologist and neuro-\npsychologist, testified as an expert for Texas that minors \nhave limited reasoning ability and cannot give informed \nconsent to the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.186\u201390. \n9. Therapy is effective. \nDr. Nangia, expert for Texas, \u201ctreat[s] her patients \nwith exploratory, supportive, and family therapy,\u201d and \ntestified that \u201cchildren with gender dysphoria benefit \ntremendously from therapy\u2014particularly psychody-\nnamic therapy.\u201d 4.CR.1447\u201349. \nDr. Taylor, expert for Texas, testified that psycho-\ntherapy is a safe and effective treatment for minors with \ngender dysphoria. 3.RR.144. She testified that minors \nwith gender dysphoria or confusion is a symptom of the \nfamily dynamic and that dysfunction in the family system \nneeds to be addressed to resolve their feelings of gender \ndysphoria and confusion. 3.RR.143\u201344. \n \n* * * \nIn sum, the district court did not and could not have \nannounced as a matter of legislative fact (\u201cestablished \ntruths, facts, or pronouncements that do not change from \ncase to case but apply universally,\u201d Gould, 536 F.2d at \n\n21 \n \n220) that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria.\u201d And the evidence set for \nthis question should not be closed. Evidence such as that \npresented in Texas\u2019s defense of its statute similar to SB1 \nand the Cass report needs to be considered before the \nCourt can announce any legislative fact about the prohib-\nited procedures. \n \n \n \n \n\n22 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. But if the Court remands this case, it should not \nannounce that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully \nimprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria\u201d as a matter of settled, \nundisputed legislative fact. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nRALPH MOLINA \nDeputy First Assistant \n  Attorney General \nAUSTIN KINGHORN \nDeputy Attorney General \n  for Legal Strategy \nOCTOBER 15, 2024 \nCHARLES K.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal thought process, a reflection on my current knowledge state and a strategic plan for information gathering. It does not contain new external evidence, facts, or legal arguments about the case itself. It confirms the importance of the \"medical uncertainty\" and \"legislative fact\" arguments introduced by the Texas amicus brief and identifies a key gap in my knowledge: the petitioner's counter-arguments and supporting evidence from their allies.\n\nTherefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are unchanged from the previous update. My cumulative beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Central Conflict\u2014Nature of the Classification (Stable):** The core legal disagreement remains whether SB1 is a facial sex classification (*Petitioner's view*) or a regulation of specific medical procedures for a specific purpose (*Respondent's view*). The Texas brief did not alter this fundamental legal clash but provided factual arguments (e.g., gender dysphoria as a purely mental condition) intended to support the respondent's framing.\n\n2.  **The Role of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (Stable):** The precedential conflict between *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test and *Feeney*'s discriminatory *purpose* requirement for Equal Protection claims remains a central, unresolved legal question. The Texas brief did not focus on this doctrinal issue, instead concentrating on the factual predicate for the law.\n\n3.  **The \"Similarly Situated\" Debate (Stable but Reinforced):** The respondent's argument that boys and girls are not \"similarly situated\" regarding these treatments is stable. The Texas brief reinforces this by introducing expert testimony asserting that biological sex is binary and immutable, providing a factual basis for the state to argue that inherent biological differences are the basis for the law's distinctions.\n\n4.  **The Standard of Review (Updated and Deepened):** My understanding of the arguments against heightened scrutiny has deepened. Beyond the legal argument to limit *Bostock*, the Texas brief provides a factual assault on the potential classification of \"transgender status\" as a quasi-suspect class.\n    *   **New Factual Challenge to Suspect Class Status:** The brief introduces evidence and expert testimony arguing that gender identity is not an immutable characteristic and can change over time. It also posits that \"adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a new phenomenon, potentially driven by \"social contagion.\" These claims directly attack the traditional criteria (e.g., immutability) the Court uses to identify suspect or quasi-suspect classes, thereby strengthening the argument that only rational basis review should apply.\n\n5.  **The State's Governmental Interest & Medical Uncertainty (Significantly Updated and Elaborated):** My prior belief was that Tennessee was invoking the \"medical uncertainty\" doctrine from *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Texas brief transformed this from a legal strategy into a detailed, evidence-based narrative. It provides a comprehensive counter-narrative to the petitioner's claim of a \"medical consensus.\"\n    *   **New Evidentiary Support:** The brief marshals a specific set of claims, purportedly backed by expert testimony from a parallel case in Texas (`Loe v. State`), to establish profound scientific dispute. These claims include:\n        *   Gender dysphoria is a \"purely a mental condition\" with no biological test.\n        *   \"Adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a recent, novel phenomenon, distinct from historical presentations and not yet in the DSM-V.\n        *   The rise in cases is a \"social contagion,\" particularly among teenage girls.\n        *   The prohibited treatments are \"experimental,\" lack high-quality evidentiary support for their benefits, and their risks (e.g., infertility) outweigh the benefits.\n        *   Safer, effective alternatives like psychotherapy exist.\n    *   **International Precedent:** The brief continues to cite the Cass Review from the UK as a key piece of evidence that other Western health systems are moving away from the \"gender-affirming\" model due to a lack of evidence.\n\n6.  **The \"Legislative Fact\" Argument (New Belief):** The Texas brief introduced a novel and sophisticated procedural argument. It urges the Court to avoid establishing a \"legislative fact\"\u2014a universally applicable truth\u2014that these medical procedures are safe and effective.\n    *   **Argument for Judicial Restraint:** Texas argues that the district court's findings were explicitly preliminary and based on a limited record, and that the US government is mischaracterizing them as settled science. It contends that the \"evidence set should not yet be closed.\"\n    *   **Predictive Significance:** This provides the Court with a potential off-ramp. The justices could rule in favor of Tennessee not by declaring the treatments harmful, but by concluding that the science is too unsettled for the judiciary to declare a constitutional right based on their efficacy. This reframes the question from \"Is this care beneficial?\" to \"Should the Court, on this record, prevent a legislature from acting in the face of scientific uncertainty?\" This pathway strongly favors a posture of judicial deference to the legislature.",

The search query, while semantically correct ('amicus brief in support of petitioner'), was likely too general, causing the search engine to incorrectly match keywords in the title of the Texas brief. This has left a critical gap in my understanding of the case, as I have a detailed view of the respondent's arguments but almost no information on the petitioner's supporting evidence and counter-arguments. To rectify this, I must formulate a more targeted search strategy. Instead of using generic terms, I will search for amicus briefs from specific organizations that are highly likely to support the petitioner's position, such as major medical associations (e.g., American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics) and prominent civil rights organizations. This approach will allow me to directly find the evidence and reasoning used to counter the 'medical uncertainty' and 'legislative fact' arguments, which are central to the respondent's case.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the full text of the amicus brief from the State of Texas in support of the respondents (Tennessee). Although the search action was intended to find briefs supporting the petitioner, it returned a document whose core arguments I have already analyzed and integrated. This observation, therefore, does not introduce new substantive arguments but instead provides the direct source text, reinforcing and adding detail to my existing beliefs. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) are substantively stable, but my confidence in the structure and evidence of the respondent's case is strengthened. The information gap regarding the petitioner's counter-arguments remains and is now more pronounced.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Central Conflict\u2014Nature of the Classification (Stable):** The fundamental legal dispute remains whether Tennessee's law constitutes a facial sex classification subject to heightened scrutiny (Petitioner's view) or a permissible regulation of specific medical procedures (Respondent's view). The full text of the Texas brief confirms its strategy is to provide a factual foundation for the latter interpretation.\n\n2.  **The Role of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (Stable):** The unresolved tension between *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test for sex discrimination and the Equal Protection Clause's traditional requirement of discriminatory *purpose* (*Feeney*) remains a central legal hurdle. The Texas brief, as confirmed by the full text, strategically avoids a deep dive into this doctrinal conflict, focusing instead on factual and procedural arguments.\n\n3.  **The \"Similarly Situated\" Debate (Stable and Reinforced):** The respondent's position that boys and girls are not \"similarly situated\" with respect to the banned treatments is stable. The full text of the Texas brief confirms the evidentiary basis for this argument, citing expert testimony from `Loe v. State` that \"there are two and only two biological sexes\" and that biological sex is an immutable, binary characteristic defined by gamete production strategy. This provides a scientific-sounding rationale for treating the sexes differently under the law.\n\n4.  **The Standard of Review (Stable and Reinforced):** My understanding of the arguments against heightened scrutiny is reinforced. The Texas brief's full text confirms its direct assault on the criteria for establishing a quasi-suspect class.\n    *   **Reinforced Factual Challenge to Suspect Class Status:** The brief explicitly cites testimony from the Texas case (`Loe v. State`) that \"gender identity can change over time\" and that \"adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a new phenomenon, distinct from historical presentations. By directly quoting its experts, the brief provides concrete evidence intended to undermine the \"immutability\" factor the Court considers for suspect-class analysis, thereby strengthening the case for applying only rational basis review.\n\n5.  **The State's Governmental Interest & Medical Uncertainty (Stable and Elaborated):** The narrative of \"medical uncertainty\" is confirmed as a primary pillar of the respondent's case. The full text provides the specific evidentiary claims marshaled by Texas in its own litigation, transforming this from a general theme into a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal of the alleged \"medical consensus.\"\n    *   **Confirmed Evidentiary Basis:** The brief explicitly lists the arguments and evidence from the `Loe v. State` record, including:\n        *   Gender dysphoria is a \"purely a mental condition\" with no biological test.\n        *   \"Adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a recent phenomenon, potentially a \"social contagion,\" and is not yet a formal diagnosis in the DSM-V.\n        *   The prohibited treatments are \"experimental,\" lack high-quality evidence, and their risks (infertility, etc.) outweigh benefits.\n        *   Psychotherapy is an effective alternative.\n    *   **Confirmed International Precedent:** The brief's citation of the Cass Review from the UK is now confirmed as a key piece of external validation for its claims of shifting international scientific opinion.\n\n6.  **The \"Legislative Fact\" Argument (Stable and Elaborated):** The full text confirms that this procedural argument is a sophisticated and central part of the respondent's-side strategy. It is presented as \"Argument I\" in the brief.\n    *   **Reinforced Argument for Judicial Restraint:** The brief explicitly argues that the district court's findings were preliminary and based on a limited record (\"Based on its review of the record, the Court agrees\"). Texas contends the US government is improperly elevating these preliminary findings into a settled \"legislative fact\" that would bind other courts.\n    *   **Confirmed \"Off-Ramp\" for the Court:** The brief's framing\u2014\"the evidence set should not yet be closed\"\u2014is confirmed as a direct appeal to judicial modesty. It offers the Court a way to rule for Tennessee by deferring to legislative judgment in the face of scientific uncertainty, rather than making a definitive ruling on the medical science itself. The brief bolsters this argument by citing legal scholarship on the nature of legislative facts (Proctor, Lawson), indicating a high degree of legal sophistication.\n\n7.  **Information Gap (Unchanged and Highlighted):** The search action failed to retrieve any amicus briefs supporting the petitioner. This observation underscores a critical gap in my knowledge base. While my understanding of the respondent's case is now highly detailed and well-sourced, I still lack the corresponding evidence and counter-arguments from the petitioner's allies. My ability to predict the outcome is hampered by this one-sided view of the evidentiary battle. The strength and detail of the Texas brief make it imperative to find the counter-narrative.",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n7: 20241015102823960_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.314)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n194: 20241015102831480_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.314)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \non social media and, while in hospital, to con-\ntact likeminded people and ask when they will \nbe admitted to the clinic. \nMy view is that gender dysphoria in children \nand young adults is largely explained as a so-\ncial contagion. A slight increase in prevalence \nstarted in 2007, when the first smartphone was \nlaunched. However, it took a few years before \nthe majority of teenagers had a smartphone, \nand this coincides quite well with the sharp in-\ncrease in the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in \nyoung people. American journalist Abigail \nSchrier's book Irreversible Damage: The \nTransgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters \n(2020) provides a vivid and detailed account of \nthe social contagion of gender dysphoria. \n4.CR.1630\u201331. \n\n14 \n \n6. Treatment of adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is a developing field. The \nprohibited treatments are experimental, \nand no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits. \nDr. Cantor, expert for Texas, testified that although \n\u201cwe have outcome studies on the childhood onset type \nand we have outcome studies on the adult onset type, we \nhave absolutely no data, we have no outcome studies on \nthis -- what I\u2019ll call the adolescent onset type even though \nthey are now suddenly the large majority of people com-\ning into clinics.\u201d 3.RR.108. \nHe also testified that there are \u201cvarious levels of evi-\ndence going from low-quality evidence that are relatively \nuncertain or ambiguous up through high-quality evi-\ndence that is highly reliable and worth generalizing to \nother people.\u201d 3.RR.83. \u201c[L]ow-quality studies are very \nnumerous in the research literature exactly because or \nas a side effect of their being easy to perform, but they're \nless reliable. The more systematic and the more reliable \nstudies are harder to perform, take more time to per-\nform, and take much more thorough analysis, so there \nare fewer of them.\u201d 3.RR.86. The highest-quality studies \nare \u201csystematic reviews which review all the other stud-\nies beneath it assessing them according to their relative \nqualities.\u201d Id. \nDr. Cantor testified that the \u201cgreat majority of the \nstudies [relied on by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts] were sur-\nveys.\u201d Surveys \u201care very, very common because it\u2019s so \neasy to conduct a survey, for example, on the Internet. \nSurveys can, you know, help us give, you know -- help us \nproduce hypotheses, can help give us ideas, but they \ndon't represent evidence at all\u2026. [T]hey can give us a \ngood idea of questions to look at, but they don't represent \n\n15 \n \nany kind of outcomes evidence.\u201d 3.RR.95. Surveys \u201cdon\u2019t \ncount as medical evidence, they don't count as outcome \nevidence, but the conclusions of the [plaintiffs\u2019] experts \ndepended largely on what doesn't count as evidence.\u201d \n3.RR.96. \nThe lowest-quality evidence comes from \u201ccase stud-\nies and reports,\u201d which \u201care generally retrospective \nstudies where somebody would go through hospital rec-\nords, for example, pull out cases of specific diagnoses and \nsee what happened amongst those people. It gives -- it \ncan give some idea of what to expect if nothing is done, \nbut because these are not systematic, they're not yet \nready for any kind of generalization to other cases.\u201d \n3.RR.90. \u201c[T]here have been a handful [of case studies \nabout the prohibited procedures on minors] published \nover the years. But again, they generally came out with \nambiguous -- with ambiguous results but results that, \nagain, suggested that it was at least worth looking at \nmore systematically.\u201d 3.RR.97\u201398. \nHigher quality evidence comes from \u201ccase-controlled \nstudies,\u201d which are \u201clooking for patterns of what hap-\npens in different groups of people or what makes differ-\nent groups of people different from each other.\u201d \n3.RR.90\u201391. Dr. Cantor is only aware of one such study, \nwhich was \u201ca particularly low-quality study because we \ncan\u2019t tell, you know, what changes, you know, what im-\nprovements and, you know, what got worse amongst \nthese people\u201d and \u201c[t]hey were in a poor mental health \nstatus to begin with.\u201d 3.RR.98. \nThe next highest-quality evidence is \u201ccohort studies,\u201d \nin which \u201cwe\u2019re now checking on a single group of people \nbut over time. We\u2019re looking to see what happened, for \nexample, before or after they were exposed to a treat-\nment or exposed to some not just substance. So instead \n\n16 \n \nof just taking a look at them at one point in time, we\u2019re \ntaking the same group of people and looking at them over \nseveral groups of time.\u201d 3.RR.91. \u201cThere have been ex-\nactly 13 [cohort studies], and these are the 13 that I sum-\nmarize in my own report. This is the highest level study \nthat so far has been conducted at all for the medical tran-\nsition of minors.\u201d 3.RR.99. \n\u201c[F]our of [the cohort studies] showed essentially no \nimprovement at all.\u201d 3.RR.100. In \u201croughly six of them, \nthere were some improvements in some mental health \nparameters, but we can\u2019t conclude that it was the inter-\nvention, that it was the medical interventions itself that \ncaused the improvement because the people were get-\nting psychotherapy at the same time.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]here were \ntwo studies which were designed in a way that allowed \nmore direct comparison trying to allocate how much of \nthe improvement was due to the medical interventions \nversus how much of the improvement was due to the \nmental health interventions. And both of those demon-\nstrate -- and both of those failed to demonstrate that the \nmedical interventions produced any more benefit than \ndid the mental health -- the psychotherapeutic interven-\ntions.\u201d 3.RR.100-01. \u201cAnd there was one other very re-\ncent study that just did not indicate whether the people \nwere in psychotherapy at the same time, so the results -\n- we can\u2019t assess whether the medical interventions were \nsuperior because we don't know how many were getting \npsychotherapy at the same time.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nThe next highest level of evidence comes from \u201cran-\ndomized controlled trials[, which] are the ones where we \ntake a group of people, randomly assign which ones are \ngoing to receive the experimental treatment and which \nones are going to receive either no treatment or some \nother comparison treatment such as treatment as usual, \n\n17 \n \na placebo treatment, or some other -- some other inter-\nvention.\u201d 3.RR.92. There have not been any randomized \ncontrol studies of the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.101. \nThe highest-level evidence comes from systematic re-\nviews, which \u201canalyze all of the studies and all of the lay-\ners that were beneath it. Again, especially in large fields \nwith many people, there are many, many studies, and es-\npecially for very busy clinicians, it\u2019s not possible to read \nand integrate every single one. So the purpose of system-\natic reviews is to get the big picture of what all of the \nother studies have shown, but as I say, to do it in a sys-\ntematic way that removes the potential for bias. The big-\ngest bias, as I mentioned, was cherry-picking where peo-\nple pick out the positive studies but don't mention the \nstudies where the experiment failed.\u201d 3.R.93\u201394. \u201cThere \nhave now been several systematic reviews, none con-\nducted in the U.S. They've all been conducted by the na-\ntional public healthcare systems in Europe.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nEach of them concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to sug-\ngest that medicalized interventions provides any benefits \nsuperior to the mental health interventions.\u201d 3.RR.102. \n\u201cEach of the systematic reviews came to the same con-\nclusion, that the evidence for benefits are outweighed by \nthe evidence of the risks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. Those \nharms include, sterilization, permanent loss of capacity \nto breast-feed, inability to orgasm and loss of sexual \nfunction, interference with neurological and cognitive de-\nvelopment, elevated risk of Parkinsonism, and reduced \nbone density. 4.CR.1220\u201325. \nIn short, there is no evidence that the prohibited pro-\ncedures are safe and effective to treat minors with gen-\nder dysphoria. The prohibited procedures have \u201cnot yet \nbeen tested with experimental studies, so it\u2019s necessarily \nstill within the experimental status.\u201d 3.RR.116. \n\n18 \n \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \nDr. Cantor\u2019s testimony is consistent with the Cass \nReport, 5 a study recently commissioned by the National \nHealth Service in the United Kingdom to evaluate the \nsafety and efficacy of puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \nThe authors of Cass Report spent four years reviewing \nclinical data, interviewing patients and providers, and \nconducting six systematic reviews. It concluded, among \nother things, the following:  \n\u2022 Gender Dysphoria: a diagnosis of gender dyspho-\nria is \u201cnot reliably predictive of whether that \nyoung person will have longstanding gender in-\ncongruence in the future, or whether medical in-\ntervention will be the best option for them.\u201d Cass \nReport at 29. \n\u2022 Social Transition: there is \u201cno clear evidence \nthat social transition in childhood has any positive \nor negative mental health outcomes, and rela-\ntively weak evidence for any effect in adoles-\ncence.\u201d Id. at 31. \n\u2022 Puberty Blockers: the use of puberty blockers \nresulted in \u201cno changes in gender dysphoria or \nbody satisfaction\u201d and there is \u201cinsufficient/incon-\nsistent evidence about the effects of puberty sup-\npression on psychological or psychosocial wellbe-\ning, cognitive development, cardio-metabolic risk \nor fertility \u2026 there is no evidence that puberty \nblockers buy time to think, and some concern that \n \n5 Hilary Cass, M.D., Independent Review of Gender Identity \nServices for Children and Young Adults, National Health Services \nEngland (Apr. 2024) (the \u201cCass Report\u201d), available at https://ti-\nnyurl.com/mw4s3arn. \n\n19 \n \nthey may change the trajectory of psychosexual \nand gender identity development.\u201d Id. at 32. \n\u2022 Cross-Sex Hormones: \u201c[t]here is a lack of high-\nquality research assessing the outcomes of hor-\nmone interventions in adolescents with gender \ndysphoria/incongruence, and few studies that un-\ndertake long-term follow-up. No conclusions can \nbe drawn about the effect on gender dysphoria, \nbody satisfaction, psychosocial health, cognitive \ndevelopment, or fertility [from the use of cross-\nsex hormones]. Uncertainty remains about the \noutcomes for height/growth, cardiometabolic and \nbone health.\u201d Id. at 33. \n\u2022 Suicides: \u201cIt has been suggested that hormone \ntreatment reduces the elevated risk of death by \nsuicide in this population, but the evidence found \ndid not support this conclusion.\u201d Id. \n7. The risks of the prohibited procedures \noutweigh the benefits. \nAs noted, Dr. Cantor testified, \u201cEach of the system-\natic reviews came to the same conclusion, that the evi-\ndence for benefits are outweighed by the evidence of the \nrisks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. \nDr. Rom\u00e1n, expert for Texas, testified that the \u201cSwe-\ndish National Board of Health and Welfare concluded \nthat \u2018the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming \ntreatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits of \nthese treatments.\u2019\u201d 4.CR.1637. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, also testified, \u201cThe po-\ntential benefits [of providing puberty blockers to minors] \ndo not outweigh the risks,\u201d 3.RR.37\u201338, and that \u201cthe \nbenefits do not outweigh the risks for cross-sex hor-\nmones for adolescents,\u201d 3.RR.52. \n\n20 \n \n8. Minors cannot give informed consent to \nthe prohibited procedures. \nDr. Geeta Nangia, a child and adolescent psychia-\ntrist, testified as an expert for Texas. She testified that \n\u201cminors lack the necessary neurological, psychosocial, \nand cognitive development to provide informed consent \nor assent to\u201d the prohibited procedures. 4.CR.1452\u201385. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that minors \nhave very limited capacity to understand the implica-\ntions of taking potentially life-altering puberty blockers \nor cross-sex hormones. 3.RR.54\u201357. \nDr. Alan Hopewell, a clinical psychologist and neuro-\npsychologist, testified as an expert for Texas that minors \nhave limited reasoning ability and cannot give informed \nconsent to the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.186\u201390. \n9. Therapy is effective. \nDr. Nangia, expert for Texas, \u201ctreat[s] her patients \nwith exploratory, supportive, and family therapy,\u201d and \ntestified that \u201cchildren with gender dysphoria benefit \ntremendously from therapy\u2014particularly psychody-\nnamic therapy.\u201d 4.CR.1447\u201349. \nDr. Taylor, expert for Texas, testified that psycho-\ntherapy is a safe and effective treatment for minors with \ngender dysphoria. 3.RR.144. She testified that minors \nwith gender dysphoria or confusion is a symptom of the \nfamily dynamic and that dysfunction in the family system \nneeds to be addressed to resolve their feelings of gender \ndysphoria and confusion. 3.RR.143\u201344. \n \n* * * \nIn sum, the district court did not and could not have \nannounced as a matter of legislative fact (\u201cestablished \ntruths, facts, or pronouncements that do not change from \ncase to case but apply universally,\u201d Gould, 536 F.2d at \n\n21 \n \n220) that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria.\u201d And the evidence set for \nthis question should not be closed. Evidence such as that \npresented in Texas\u2019s defense of its statute similar to SB1 \nand the Cass report needs to be considered before the \nCourt can announce any legislative fact about the prohib-\nited procedures. \n \n \n \n \n\n22 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. But if the Court remands this case, it should not \nannounce that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully \nimprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria\u201d as a matter of settled, \nundisputed legislative fact. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nRALPH MOLINA \nDeputy First Assistant \n  Attorney General \nAUSTIN KINGHORN \nDeputy Attorney General \n  for Legal Strategy \nOCTOBER 15, 2024 \nCHARLES K.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a record of my own internal reasoning\u2014a \"THINK\" action. It contains no new external facts, evidence, or arguments related to the case of *U.S. v. Skrmetti*. Instead, it is a metacognitive reflection on a previous failed search and a plan to rectify the resulting information imbalance. As this observation provides no new substantive information that would alter my prediction, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain entirely stable. The observation serves only to confirm and highlight the significance of the previously identified \"Information Gap.\"\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are therefore unchanged:\n\n1.  **Central Conflict\u2014Nature of the Classification (Stable):** The core legal question remains whether Tennessee's law is a facial sex classification demanding heightened scrutiny (Petitioner's view) or a permissible regulation of medical procedures that applies neutrally (Respondent's view). The Texas amicus brief has provided a detailed evidentiary and rhetorical framework for the latter position.\n\n2.  **The Role of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (Stable):** The doctrinal tension between *Bostock*'s broad \"but-for\" test for sex discrimination and the Equal Protection Clause's traditional requirement of discriminatory *purpose* (*Feeney*) is a key unresolved issue. The respondent's side, as exemplified by the Texas brief, appears to be sidestepping a direct confrontation with this tension, preferring to focus on the factual record and the standard of review.\n\n3.  **The \"Similarly Situated\" Debate (Stable and Reinforced):** The respondent's argument that boys and girls are not \"similarly situated\" regarding the banned treatments is a cornerstone of their defense against an equal protection claim. This belief is reinforced by the specific evidence from the Texas brief, which grounds this legal argument in a biological-determinist framework, citing expert testimony that biological sex is an immutable, binary characteristic.\n\n4.  **The Standard of Review (Stable and Reinforced):** My understanding of the respondent's strategy to avoid heightened scrutiny is solid. The Texas brief confirms a direct challenge to the criteria for establishing a quasi-suspect class for transgender individuals.\n    *   **Reinforced Factual Challenge to Suspect Class Status:** The brief provides concrete evidentiary claims from its own litigation (`Loe v. State`)\u2014such as \"gender identity can change over time\" and the idea of \"adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" as a new phenomenon\u2014to directly attack the \"immutability\" factor, a key consideration for the Court in suspect-class analysis. This strengthens the argument for applying the more deferential rational basis review.\n\n5.  **The State's Governmental Interest & Medical Uncertainty (Stable and Elaborated):** The \"medical uncertainty\" narrative is a primary justification for the law. My belief in this has been elaborated with specific evidentiary points marshaled by Texas, including claims that gender dysphoria is a \"purely a mental condition,\" that treatments are \"experimental,\" and that psychotherapy is a viable alternative.\n    *   **Confirmed International Precedent:** The respondent's side is leveraging the UK's Cass Review as external validation for their claim that the international scientific consensus is shifting away from affirming care for minors, bolstering their argument for legislative caution.\n\n6.  **The \"Legislative Fact\" Argument (Stable and Elaborated):** This procedural argument, confirmed as \"Argument I\" in the Texas brief, offers the Court an \"off-ramp.\" It posits that the district court's findings on medical consensus were preliminary and that the US government is improperly trying to elevate them to settled \"legislative fact.\" This invites judicial restraint, allowing the Court to defer to legislative judgment in the face of what the respondents frame as ongoing scientific debate, rather than making a definitive ruling on the science itself.\n\n7.  **Information Gap (Unchanged and Highlighted):** The most critical aspect of my current belief state is the significant, one-sided information gap. My knowledge of the respondent's case is detailed and well-sourced, while my knowledge of the petitioner's counter-arguments and supporting evidence is minimal.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the result of a failed search action. My query was specifically designed to locate amicus briefs from major medical organizations (AMA, AAP) supporting the petitioner, in a direct attempt to fill the significant information gap I had previously identified. The search did not return the requested documents. Instead, it returned the amicus brief from the State of Texas supporting the respondents\u2014a document I have already analyzed in detail.\n\nThis observation contains no new substantive information, facts, or arguments regarding the case. Therefore, my core beliefs about the legal strategies and evidentiary claims of the parties remain stable. However, the observation itself\u2014the failure of my targeted search\u2014is a new signal that powerfully reinforces and elevates the importance of the information imbalance.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are therefore consolidated and reinforced as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Stable and Reinforced):** My understanding of the respondent's case, primarily informed by the Texas amicus brief, is unchanged. The re-surfacing of this same document confirms its salience. The key pillars of their argument remain:\n    *   **Classification:** The law is a neutral regulation of medical procedures, not a classification based on sex or transgender status.\n    *   **Standard of Review:** The law should be subject only to rational basis review because transgender status is not a quasi-suspect class (lacking immutability), and there is no facial sex discrimination.\n    *   **State Interest:** The state has a compelling interest in protecting minors from what it characterizes as \"experimental\" and \"irreversible\" medical procedures, citing a purported lack of scientific consensus and pointing to international shifts in medical opinion (e.g., the Cass Review).\n    *   **\"Similarly Situated\" Argument:** Boys and girls are not similarly situated with respect to these specific treatments, which are prescribed based on a discordance with biological sex, thus defeating an equal protection claim.\n\n2.  **The \"Legislative Fact\" Off-Ramp (Stable and Reinforced):** The procedural argument that the Court should not establish a binding \"legislative fact\" about the efficacy of gender-affirming care based on a preliminary injunction record remains a key strategic element for the respondents. This argument, detailed again in the observed document, offers the Court a path to side with Tennessee by deferring to legislative judgment amidst what the state frames as scientific uncertainty, without needing to definitively rule on the underlying medical science.\n\n3.  **The Information Gap (Critically Reinforced and Elevated):** My previous belief in an information gap has now been updated. It is not merely a passive lack of information; it is a confirmed, active obstacle. My direct attempt to acquire countervailing arguments and evidence from the petitioner's key allies (the mainstream medical establishment) has failed. This has several implications:\n    *   **Increased Uncertainty:** My confidence in any prediction is now lower than before. Without access to the petitioner's best evidence and arguments, my model of the case is fundamentally incomplete and biased toward the well-documented respondent position.\n    *   **Heightened Importance of Missing Information:** I now know that the petitioner's counter-narrative is essential. Specifically, I need to understand how the U.S. and its amici (1) frame the medical consensus, (2) rebut the \"medical uncertainty\" and \"social contagion\" claims, and (3) argue that *Bostock*'s logic should apply directly to this Equal Protection challenge.\n\nIn summary, while my knowledge of the respondent's case is solid and stable, the latest observation has confirmed that my understanding of the petitioner's case is virtually non-existent. The failure to find the AMA/AAP brief transforms the information gap from a hypothesis into a confirmed and central feature of my current belief state, severely limiting my ability to make a balanced prediction.",

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatients in appropriate cases.2  \n \n2 Those include (among others) the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospi-\ntal; the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital; the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hos-\npital in Columbus, Ohio; the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pitts-\nburgh; Duke Children\u2019s Hospital & Health Center; the Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia; Children\u2019s National Hospital in the \n \n\n7 \n \nB. Tennessee SB1 \n1. Puberty blockers have been used to treat gender \ndysphoria for 20 years and precocious puberty for more \nthan 30 years.  J.A. 964, 967.  And hormone therapy has \nbeen used even longer\u2014for at least 60 years to treat \ngender dysphoria in adults, and at least 20 years in ad-\nolescents.  See Pet. App. 2a, 5a, 265a. \nIn the last three years, however, state legislatures \nhave adopted a wave of bans on gender-affirming care \nfor minors based on model legislation and legislative \nfindings circulated by advocacy groups.  In 2021, Arkan-\nsas became the first state to enact a ban.  See Ark. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 20-9-1502(a).  In 2022, Alabama followed.  See \nAla. Code \u00a7 26-26-4.  And in the year and a half since, 20 \nother States have done the same.3   \n2. This case is about the ban Tennessee adopted in \nMarch 2023, the Prohibition on Medical Procedures \nPerformed on Minors Related to Sexual Identity, Sen-\nate Bill 1, Tenn.

See Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 58-1-\n603, 58-1-603.1; W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20.  See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B), 68-33-103(a)(1).5  \nSB1 defines \u201c[s]ex\u201d as the \u201cimmutable characteristics of \nthe reproductive system that define the individual as \nmale or female, as determined by anatomy and genetics \nexisting at the time of birth.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-102(9).  \nBecause SB1\u2019s prohibition applies only when a cov-\nered treatment is prescribed to allow individuals to live \nin conformity with a gender identity other than their \nsex assigned at birth, the law does not restrict the \n \n4 See, e.g., Tenn. Pub. Ch. 285 (enacted Apr. 28, 2023) (Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 49-50-805) (limiting students to participating in interscholas-\ntic athletic events \u201conly in accordance with the student\u2019s sex\u201d at \nbirth); Tenn. Pub. Ch. 448 (enacted May 17, 2023) (Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 49-6-5102) (specifying that public school teachers need not refer \nto a student by pronouns inconsistent with the student\u2019s sex as-\nsigned at birth). \n5  SB1 also prohibits surgical procedures provided for the same \npurposes, but that prohibition is not at issue here.  Pet. App. 9a-10a, \n140a-142a.   \n\n9 \n \nprovision of puberty blockers or hormones for any other \npurpose.  The law also explicitly exempts those treat-\nments when they are prescribed \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s con-\ngenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical \ninjury.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  The \nterms \u201c[c]ongenital defect\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d are defined to \ninclude an \u201cabnormality present in a minor that is in-\nconsistent with the normal development of a human be-\ning of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d but specifically exclude \u201cgender \ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, [and] gender in-\ncongruence.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(2).   \nViolations of SB1 are punishable by civil penalties of \n$25,000 for each prohibited treatment, professional dis-\ncipline, and potential civil liability in private suits.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-105 to 68-33-107.  The law took ef-\nfect on July 1, 2023. \nC. The Present Controversy \n1. Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4.

The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.

But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb.

Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).

(quoting \nTenn.

Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L. Stutzman, Long-term use of antidepressants, mood \nstabilizers, and antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a focus on \nappropriate deprescribing, 11 Mental Health Clinician 320, 329-330 \n(2021). \n12 See, e.g., Ankita Nanda et al., Adverse Effects of Stimulant In-\nterventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): \nA Comprehensive Systematic Review, 15 Cureus, no. 9, at 9 (Sept. \n2023); Natalia M.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal thought process, a reflection on my own knowledge state and information-gathering strategy. It contains no new external facts, evidence, or arguments about the case itself. Therefore, my substantive beliefs about the legal positions of the parties remain unchanged from the previous state.\n\nHowever, this observation refines my understanding of my own epistemic position and solidifies my strategy. It acts as a formal confirmation and articulation of the conclusions drawn from my previous failed search. My cumulative beliefs are now structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondent's Case (Stable and Well-Defined):** My knowledge of the arguments supporting Tennessee remains solid, based entirely on the amicus brief from Texas and other states. This position is built on several key pillars:\n    *   **Standard of Review:** The law should be subject to rational basis review. This is argued on the grounds that it regulates medical procedures neutrally, not on the basis of sex or transgender status, and that transgender status is not a quasi-suspect class.\n    *   **State's Interest:** The state has a legitimate, even compelling, interest in protecting minors from what it characterizes as \"experimental,\" \"irreversible,\" and potentially harmful medical treatments. This argument is supported by citing a purported lack of long-term scientific consensus and highlighting shifts in European medical guidelines (e.g., the Cass Review).\n    *   **Equal Protection Argument:** The law does not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it treats boys and girls identically with respect to the prohibited treatments. The argument is that the \"similarly situated\" requirement for a discrimination claim is not met, as the treatments are prescribed based on a discordance with biological sex, not sex itself.\n    *   **Procedural Off-Ramp:** A key strategic argument available to the Court is to defer to legislative judgment in an area of scientific uncertainty. This \"legislative fact\" argument allows the Court to uphold the law without making a definitive ruling on the medical science, especially on a preliminary injunction record.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Case (The Known Unknown - Stable):** My understanding of the petitioner's (United States) case remains a complete void. The previous observation confirmed this was a critical information gap. This new observation\u2014my own internal reasoning\u2014cements this gap as the single most important feature of my current belief state. I still lack any direct information on how the petitioner will:\n    *   Argue for heightened scrutiny.\n    *   Frame the medical evidence to establish a consensus on the safety and efficacy of gender-affirming care.\n    *   Rebut the respondent's claims of \"medical uncertainty\" and \"experimentation.\"\n    *   Apply precedents like *Bostock v. Clayton County* to argue that discrimination based on transgender status is inherently a form of sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n3.  **Strategic Refinement (New Meta-Belief):** The primary update from this observation is meta-cognitive. I have now formally integrated a strategic directive into my belief state: the most direct and essential action is to acquire the primary brief from the petitioner, the United States. My previous, less-targeted search attempts have been diagnosed as inefficient. This internal reasoning solidifies the belief that guessing at amicus briefs is a suboptimal strategy and that the petitioner's own brief is the highest-value, authoritative source needed to resolve the critical information imbalance.\n\nIn summary, my substantive beliefs are stable: I have a one-sided model of the case favoring the respondent's well-documented arguments. The new observation adds no new case facts but formally diagnoses this imbalance and updates my procedural beliefs, making the acquisition of the \"Brief for the United States\" the singular, immediate priority for creating a valid predictive model. My confidence in any outcome prediction remains at a nadir.",

WFA has a unique \nand \nsignificant \nstatewide \npresence \nwith \nits \neducational and advocacy work in public policy and \nthe culture. WFA\u2019s interest in this case stems directly \nfrom its core issues. \n \nThe Illinois Family Institute (IFI) is a \nnonprofit educational and lobbying organization \nbased in Tinley Park, Illinois, that exists to advance \nlife, faith, family, and religious freedom in public \npolicy and culture from a Christian worldview.   \nThe \nInternational \nConference \nof \nEvangelical Chaplain Endorsers (ICECE) has as \nits main function to endorse chaplains to the military \nand other organizations requiring chaplains that do \nnot have a denominational structure to do so, avoiding \nthe entanglement with religion that the government \nwould otherwise have if it determined chaplain \nendorsements. ICECE safeguards religious liberty for \nall.  \nThe Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) is a non-\nprofit legal organization established under section \n501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Since its \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or \nin part.  No person or entity other than amici and their \ncounsel made a monetary contribution intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of this brief.   \n\n \n2  \n \nfounding in 1997, PJI has advised and represented in \ncourt and administrative proceedings thousands of \nindividuals, businesses, and religious institutions, \nparticularly in the realm of First Amendment and \nparental rights. PJI often represents teachers, \nparents, and their children to vindicate their \nconstitutional rights in public schools, including with \nrespect to children exhibiting as transgender. As such, \nPJI has a strong interest in the development of the \nlaw in this area. \n \nThe National Legal Foundation (NLF) is a \npublic interest law firm dedicated to the defense of \nfundamental parental rights and First Amendment \nliberties, including the freedoms of speech, assembly, \nand religion. The NLF and its donors and supporters, \nin particular those from Tennessee, are vitally \nconcerned with the outcome of this case because of its \neffect on the fundamental rights of parents and their \nminor children.  \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nTransgenderism \nis \nthis \ngeneration\u2019s \nphrenology, only it does more immediate harm. It is \nbased on incorrect philosophical assumptions and \npseudo-science. This Court\u2019s unfortunate opinion in \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), \ncommitted the cardinal logical error of assuming its \nconclusion. Its reasoning should be cabined, if not \ndisclaimed, and it should certainly not be extended to \nthe Equal Protection Clause. Application to that area \nwould actually undercut the clause\u2019s protections \nestablished for sex in appropriate circumstances. \n\n \n3  \n \nTransgenderism is a philosophy at war with itself, \nand it deserves no special constitutional protection. \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. \nBostock Was Based on a Logical Fallacy, \nand Its Pernicious Effect Should Be \nCabined, Not Extended \n \nThe United States\u2019 and L.W.\u2019s argument to \nextend equal protection guarantees to transgender \nindividuals is based on and follows this Court\u2019s \nreasoning in Bostock. (Pet. Br. at 21-28; L.W. Br. at \n23-32.) Bostock, however, committed the fundamental \nlogical error of assuming its conclusion,2 resulting in \nan interpretation of Title VII that would have \nastounded its enactors in 1964. See 590 U.S. at 683-\n99 (Alito, J., dissenting); id. at 780-81, 804 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). This case affords this \nCourt the opportunity to cabin the error of Bostock \nand to reason logically and in conformity with the \nadopters of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nIn contention in this case are two philosophical \nviews of reality. What Justice Blacklock of the Texas \nSupreme Court called the \u201cTransgender Vision\u201d \nclaims that all of us have a \u201csex assigned at birth\u201d that \nmay deviate from our inwardly felt \u201cgender identity.\u201d \nWhen a person\u2019s biological sex and gender identity \ndiverge, the Transgender Vision holds that a person \n \n2 This logical error is an example of circular reasoning and \nis also termed \u201cbegging the question\u201d and, in Latin, \u201cpetitio \nprincipii.\u201d \n\n \n4  \n \nshould normally give \u201cgender identity\u201d priority and, \nwhen that person does so, it would be \u201cunfair\u201d and \n\u201cunjust\u201d not to recognize the person as the gender \nthey have selected, as if they had been born that way. \nConversely, what Justice Blacklock termed the \n\u201cTraditional Vision\u201d sees things quite differently. Sex \nis not \u201cassigned at birth,\u201d but is an innate and \nimmutable characteristic that cannot be altered by a \nmental desire or inclination. Thus, we as individuals \ndo not decide whether to \u201cidentify\u201d as male or female; \nwe are male or female, whatever we feel about the \nmatter.3 The Petitioners refer to this as a difference \nbetween subjective and objective visions of reality.  \n \nIn a key passage in Bostock, this Court stated \nas follows:  \n \nOr take an employer who fires a transgender \nperson who was identified as a male at birth \nbut who now identifies as a female. If the \nemployer \nretains \nan \notherwise \nidentical \nemployee who was identified as female at birth, \nthe employer intentionally penalizes a person \nidentified as male at birth for traits or actions \nthat it tolerates in an employee identified as \nfemale at birth.  \n \n590 U.S. at 660. The problem with this reasoning is \nthat it assumes the reality and veracity of the \nTransgender Vision, i.e., that a male who \u201cidentifies\u201d \n \n3 State v. Loe, 67 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1421, 2024 WL 3219030 \nat *15-*16 (June 28, 2024) (Blacklock, J., concurring). \n\n \n5  \n \nas a woman is \u201cidentical\u201d to a female who \u201cidentifies\u201d \nas a woman. From this starting point, the Bostock \nmajority expanded that, taking two similarly situated \nemployees, one a male at birth now identifying as a \nfemale and the other a female at birth who still \nidentifies as female, if the employer fires only the \nformer, biological \u201csex plays an unmistakable and \nimpermissible role\u201d in the action. Id.   \n \nIf the only thing that mattered was how \npersons \u201cidentify\u201d themselves subjectively, then a \nmale who identifies as female and a female who does \nthe same would be similarly situated. But to charge \nan employer with discrimination based on sex (rather \nthan gender) discrimination because it fired the male \nwho identifies as a female, one has to switch back to \nthat person really being male (his biological sex) while \npresenting as female (his preferred gender). For there \nto be a true correlation, the female similarly situated \nhas to be presenting as the male gender, i.e., as a \ngender other than her biological sex. If the employer \nfired males presenting as females but did not fire \nfemales presenting as males, then you would have sex \ndiscrimination.4 \nSee \nid. \nat \n697-98 \n(Alito, \nJ., \ndissenting) (demonstrating majority\u2019s illogical \u201cbattle \nof labels\u201d). The Bostock majority\u2019s holding that an \n \n4 Of course, this reflects the underlying philosophical \ntension in transgenderism. It holds that physical sex is not \nthe \u201creal\u201d person but then defines the \u201creal\u201d person as the \nother physical sex. And there is no reason that a subjective \n\u201cgender\u201d feeling cannot change, as detransitioners show. \nThe philosophical tension generated by transgenderism is \ndiscussed further in part II, infra. \n\n \n6  \n \nemployee proves discrimination simply by showing \nthat an employer took biological sex into account \nwhen firing him, see id. at 657-58, or that he was fired \n\u201cfor traits or actions [the employer] would not have \nquestioned in members of a different sex [who \npresented in accord with their sex],\u201d id. at 652, simply \ndoes not follow. \n \nLogical \nfallacies \noften \nhave \nunintended \nrepercussions, and that is true here. See id. at 804 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (prognosticating that the \nmajority \ndecision \nwill \n\u201clikely \nreverberate \nin \nunpredictable ways for years to come\u201d). A simple \nexample shows the error of the Bostock majority\u2019s \nreasoning.  \n \nSuppose a male employee, Bob, who does not \nidentify as female, is discharged because he \nrepeatedly enters the women\u2019s restroom and locker \nroom. Using the reasoning of Bostock, his firing \nviolates Title VII: because women are not fired for \nentering the women\u2019s restroom and locker room, but \nonly he as a man, biological \u201csex plays an \nunmistakable \nand \nimpermissible \nrole\u201d \nin \nhis \ndischarge. Id. at 660. And taking the Bostock \nrationale further, it does no good for the employer to \nargue that it also fired Heather, who is a female who \nidentifies as such, because she repeatedly entered the \nmen\u2019s restroom and locker room, as her discharge, too, \nnecessarily made reference to her biological sex. Bob \ninvading the women\u2019s room and Heather invading the \nmen\u2019s room would each have been disciplined taking \ninto account their sex, or, to use Bostock\u2019s \nformulation, because of \u201cactions [the employer] would \nnot have questioned in members of a different sex.\u201d \n\n \n7  \n \nId. at 652. That their employer applied a rule \nforbidding all employees to go into the other sex\u2019s \nrestroom and locker room does not cure the problem \nunder Bostock because, it instructs, Title VII protects \nan individual. Id. at 659. \u201cInstead of avoiding Title VII \nexposure, this employer doubles it.\u201d Id. As this \nillustration demonstrates, the Bostock rationale \ndoesn\u2019t work, unless one wants to indulge the \npreposterous presumption that Congress, whether it \nknew it at the time or not, was mandating open-sex \nrestrooms and locker rooms by all covered employers. \n \nThe proper comparison for \u201csex\u201d discrimination \nis between male and female, not between those who \npresent as male (no matter their sex) and those who \ndo not. Thus, Bostock was wrong because the \nemployers did not discriminate on the basis of sex: \nthey took action against both men and women equally \nwhen they presented as transgender. See 590 U.S. at \n698-99 (Alito, J., dissenting). \u201cBostock\u2019s logic cannot \nstand if a person\u2019s declaration of a transgender \nidentity is understood as a misguided break from \nreality, as it was by nearly everyone in 1964\u2014rather \nthan as a revelation of reality, as it is by some people \ntoday.\u201d5 \n \n \n5 State v. Loe, 2024 WL 3219030 at *19 (Blacklock, J., \nconcurring). The majority opinion in Loe refused to \nextend Bostock\u2019s reasoning to the Equal Protection Clause \nand held that the Texas statute prohibiting certain \ntransgender-related surgeries on minors did not violate the \nclause.  Id. at *13-*15 (finding that transgenderism was \nneither the equivalent of sex for equal protection purposes \nnor a protected class). \n\n \n8  \n \nThe issue of whether a male identifying as \nfemale is in the same position as a biological female \nfor Equal Protection Clause purposes cannot be \nanswered simply by assuming the accuracy of the \nTransgender Vision, i.e., that people actually are the \nsex they subjectively claim they are. Those who \nadopted the Fourteenth Amendment certainly did not \nmake any such assumption. They unquestionably \nheld to the Traditional Vision, that boys are boys and \ngirls are girls, whatever they might feel, think, or \ndesire. Thus, transgender \u201cgirls\u201d and real girls are not \nin the same class on a physical, philosophical, or \nlogical basis. This Court should not infect its Equal \nProtection Clause jurisprudence with the misguided, \ncircular reasoning it used in Bostock. \n \nII. \nGranting \nTransgender \nIndividuals \nProtected Status Would Erode Equal \nProtection for Sex, and Particularly for \nWomen  \n \nThe Transgender Vision as a philosophy is at \nwar with itself, as well as with reality. If sex is fluid, \nthen, at the end of the day, there is no such thing as \nan immutable sex characteristic and no common \nground on which to describe and differentiate the \nsexes. For this reason, some in the homosexual rights \nmovement have spoken against the transgender \nmovement.  \n \nReferring to the common LGBTQ+ acronym, \nProfessor Carl Trueman describes the present \ncultural phenomenon as \u201cThe Triumph of the T.\u201d Carl \nTrueman, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self \n\n \n9  \n \n339-78 \n(2020). \nHe \npoints \nout \nthat \n\u201cboth \ntransgenderism and queer theory are predicated on a \nbasic denial of the fixed nature of gender, something \nthat the L and the G by contrast assume.\u201d Id. at 340-\n41. While those encompassed by LGBTQ+ have forged \na political coalition based on victimhood, id. at 353-57, \nTrueman also reports that \u201cthe status of transgender \npeople is today a matter of acrimonious dispute \namong those who have campaigned for women\u2019s \nrights.\u201d Id. at 357. Trueman summarizes the work of \nfeminist Janice Raymond as follows: \n \nthough what constitutes female identity \n(gender) in different times and different \ncultures may vary greatly, these various \nidentities are connected to common forms of \nbodily \nexperience. \nTo \nreject \nthat, \nas \ntransgenderism does, is to move gender \nentirely into the realm of the psychological and \nto deny, in a quasi-gnostic fashion, any \nsignificance to the body. \n \n. . . . Being a woman is now something that can \nbe \nproduced \nby \na \ntechnique\u2014literally \nprescribed by a doctor. The pain, the struggle, \nand the history of oppression that shape what \nit means to be a woman in society are thus \ntrivialized and rendered irrelevant. \n \nTrueman puts the point succinctly: \u201cas soon as \nbiology is discounted as being one decisive factor of \nsignificance for identity, the L, the G, and the B are \nalso destabilized as meaningful categories.\u201d Id. at 362. \n\n \n10  \n \nAnd again, \u201cIf gender is completely psychologized and \nsevered from biological sex, then categories built on \nthe old male-female binary cease to be relevant . . . .\u201d \nId. \nat \n365. \nTaken \nto \nits \nlogical \nextreme, \ntransgenderism makes distinctions based on the \nbinary of male-female sex meaningless. \n \nThis Court has recognized that, for many \npurposes (although not all), the sex of an individual is \nnot of consequence and the government may not \ndistinguish among individuals on the basis of sex \nwithout violating the Equal Protection Clause. See \nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) \n(\u201cthe sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to \nability to perform or contribute to society\u201d); Reed v. \nReed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971). That precedent is based on \nthe (accurate) assumptions that sex is not a personal \nselection, but immutable. See id.; see also Nguyen v. \nINS, 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001); United States v. Va., 518 \nU.S. 515, 533 (1996). If the Transgender Vision is \ncorrect, that foundational premise about sex is \ninaccurate, and protection of sex as a classification for \nequal protection must fall. If there is no immutable \nversion of sex, but only an infinitely modulating sense \nof gender identity, then there is no fixed sex to protect \nfor Equal Protection Clause purposes and no traits \nand attributes that can be attributed to one sex versus \nthe other on which to base a claim of discrimination. \n \nThe \nbasic \ninconsistency \nin \ntransgender \nphilosophy works itself out in cases involving minors \nas follows: government actors that assist minors \ntransition genders, such as public schools and foster \n\n \n11  \n \ncare agencies, simultaneously insist that (a) minors \nare mature enough to make this life-changing \ndecision for themselves and (b) these same minors are \nso sensitive that anyone that doesn\u2019t immediately \naffirm their transgender impulse by using their newly \nminted names and faux pronouns causes them \ncrushing emotional trauma. This attempt to shut \ndown any expressed disagreement with their \u201cnewly \ndiscovered self\u201d runs directly counter, of course, to \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nlong-established \ncase \nlaw \nthat \ndisagreement with the ideas expressed by others \nprovides no warrant to stifle their speech.  See Matal \nv. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 244 (2017) (Alito, J., plurality \nop.) (collecting cases). It also demonstrates the \nphilosophy\u2019s own weakness, as any theory that must \nbe propped up by having it both ways is intellectually \nbankrupt and certainly unworthy of constitutional \nprotection. \n \nThe fixed star of transgenderism is the \nindividual self, and this turns out to be no star at all. \nIf individuals, simply by thinking about it, are free to \nchange genders once, they are free to do so multiple \ntimes, as detransitioners demonstrate. And if the \nmind may override the physical attributes of the body \nin this way, why is there any need to try to \napproximate another gender physically in the first \nplace? If gender is not fixed, but fluid, then it should \nnot matter what body one has. Yet, transgender \nindividuals seek to take on the appearance and even \nattributes of a body that they say has no fixed reality. \nIronically, the attributes of the other sex to which \nthey aspire turn out to be the stereotypical attributes \n\n \n12  \n \nwhich \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nfound \nindicative \nof \nunconstitutional sex discrimination.  See, e.g., Va., \n518 U.S. at 549-51; Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, \n458 U.S. 718, 725 (1982); Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 684-\n85. \n \nA philosophy at war with itself, at war with \nreality, and at war against the affected individual\u2019s \nown body has no claims on permanency. If this Court \nwere to adopt transgenderism as a dominant cultural \nand constitutional philosophy, it would necessarily \nportend the crumbling of the category of physical sex, \nultimately emasculating the current protections for \nthat status.  \n \nIII. \nTransgenderism Should Not Be Granted \nAny Type of Protected Status \n \nWe leave largely to others to elaborate on the \nobvious: transgenderism does not qualify for protected \nstatus under any test previously used by this Court.  \nMoreover, we will leave to others the battle of the \nsocial science studies, while noting that the tide has \nmarkedly turned against the efficacy of \u201cgender-\naffirming\u201d care via pharmaceuticals and surgeries.  \n \nWe do wish to point out something else that is \nboth \nobvious \nand \nsettled \nbiological \nscience: \nindividuals are made either male or female at \nconception. They have either XY chromosomes in all \nof the trillions of cells in their mature body (except for \nred blood cells and reproductive cells), in which case \nthey are male, or XX chromosomes, in which case they \n\n \n13  \n \nare female. No pharmaceutical or surgical procedure \ncan or will ever change that basic, biological fact.  \n \nTransgenderism is just as irrational as \u201ctrans-\nstaturism,\u201d explained by the following example: I am \nsix feet tall. However, no matter what the tape \nmeasure says, I have a deep inner understanding that \nI am really 6\u201911\u201d, and that\u2019s the height that I believe \nmyself to be. I do not believe anyone has a right to tell \nme what height I am, because I am the one who \ndecides for myself what my inner self is and is meant \nto be. Thus, I also have a right to have surgery to \nlengthen my limbs and have my physical body \ncorrespond to my mental understanding of who I \nreally am. I also believe I have the right to require \nothers to treat me as 6\u201911\u201d and to seek legal relief \nagainst those who fail to do so. \n \nIf I expressed these thoughts widely and \nsincerely, I would be considered irrational and \nmentally unfit. That\u2019s exactly what I would be. It is no \ndifferent with respect to transgender individuals.6  \n \nFinally, the operating assumption of those \nrequiring adolescents to be affirmed in exhibiting as \ntransgender is flawed. We will leave to others the \ncataloguing of studies and their findings. We note, \n \n6 Another example would be \u201ctrans-ageism.\u201d Even though \nunder 60, could someone rationally claim that they \nconsider themselves to be 65 and entitled immediately to \nretirement benefits? Or a 16-year-old claim he considers \nhimself 21 and so able to procure and consume alcoholic \nbeverages? \n\n \n14  \n \nhowever, what we believe is uncontroverted: that \nchildren who express discomfort with their biological \nsex also present with other symptoms such as anxiety \nand suicidal ideation. As the United States puts it, \n\u201ceveryone agrees [that gender confusion] is a serious \nmedical condition.\u201d (Pet. Br. at 31.) The question that \npresents itself is whether exhibiting as transgender \nwill cure these children or whether their gender \nconfusion is simply another symptom of their \nunstable psychological condition. Those who advocate \nfor aggressively treating children as transgender, \neven when pre-pubescent and even to the extent of \ntaking non-reversible pharmaceutical and surgical \nsteps, adopt the presumption that exhibiting as \ntransgender will cure the other mental ills of the \nchild. That is certainly not something that can be \nknown a priori, and it is just as logical to assume that \ngender confusion is just another symptom of other \nmental conditions. Indeed, the most recent and \nreliable studies show that the overall mental health \nof those who transition, including those upon whom \nmedical procedures are performed, does not improve \nover time.7 \n \nThose clamoring for a protected status for those \nexhibiting as transgender are seeking to have this \nCourt assume this same, faulty predicate that \nexhibiting as transgender will cure a child\u2019s mental \nproblems. But this issue should not be moved from \nlegislative chambers to the courtroom. If this Court \n \n7 See, e.g., studies collected in Amicus Brief of Society for \nEvidence-Based Gender Medicine. \n\n \n15  \n \ndid so by constitutionalizing the faulty assumption \nthat \npharmaceutical \nand \nsurgical \ntransgender \ninterventions are sometimes medically necessary for \nminors, as the United States urges (Pet. Br. at 31-49), \nit would do grave harm to both individuals and our \nsystem of government. \n \nFor the Equal Protection Clause to operate, the \nparties have to be \u201cin all relevant respects alike.\u201d \nNordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). The simple, \nunalterable fact is that a person who presents as male \nbut has female reproductive organs and chromosomes \nis not \u201cin all relevant respects alike\u201d to a person who \npresents as male and has the reproductive organs and \nchromosomes to match. That difference is the very \nreason that the former person is called \u201ctransgender\u201d \nand the latter is not. By definition, those who exhibit \nas transgender and those who do not are in that very \nrespect not \u201cin all respects alike.\u201d Id. Biological males \nand females are \u201cnot fungible.\u201d Ballard v. United \nStates, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946). Neither are females \nfungible with biological males presenting as females. \n\u201cGender identity\u201d does not equate to \u201csex,\u201d and it \nnever will. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n\u201cTransgenderism\u201d \nand \n\u201cgender \nidentity\u201d \ndiscrimination \nare \nnot \nthe \nsame \nas \n\u201csex\u201d \ndiscrimination, and they have no protected status \nunder the Equal Protection Clause.

Lib-\nerty Counsel engages in strategic litigation to pro-\ntect the freedom of speech of professionals, busi-\nnessowners, ministers, and ordinary Americans \nfrom all walks of life. Liberty Counsel attorneys \nhave represented clients before this Court, federal \ncircuit courts of appeals, and federal and state trial \ncourts nationwide. Liberty Counsel attorneys also \nhave spoken or testified before Congress on matters \nrelating to government infringement on First \nAmendment rights. \nAs part of its mission, Liberty Counsel has repre-\nsented or provided legal counsel to numerous li-\ncensed counselors who diagnose and treat patients \nwith emotional and mental disorders and dysfunc-\ntions (whether cognitive, affective, behavioral, or \nsexual), including patients with unwanted same-sex \nattractions, behaviors, or identity, and gender dys-\nphoria. These counselors exclusively use talk ther-\napy whereby the client expresses his or her stressor \nto the counselor, and the counselor and client talk to \nhelp the client achieve their self-determined objec-\ntive. To that end, Liberty Counsel has challenged on \nFirst Amendment grounds several state and local \nlaws that prohibit counselors from using talk ther-\napy to help their clients explore their unwanted \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no person other than Amicus or its counsel made a \nmonetary contribution intended to fund this brief\u2019s preparation \nor submission. \n\n \n \n \n2 \nsexual attractions, behaviors, or confusion. See, e.g., \nOtto v. City of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. \n2020); Vazzo v. City of Tampa, No. 19-14387, 2023 \nWL 1466603 (11th Cir. Feb. 2, 2023); King v. Gover-\nnor of the State of New Jersey, 767 F.3d 216 (3d Cir. \n2014), cert denied sub nom., King v. Christie, 575 \nU.S. 996 (2015); Pickup v. Brown, 740 F.3d 1208 (9th \nCir. 2014), cert denied, 573 U.S. 945 (2014). See also \nMountain Right to Life, Inc. v. Becerra, 585 U.S. \n1027 (2018) (granting petition for writ of certiorari \nin challenge to California law that mandated crisis \npregnancy centers to notify women about the avail-\nability of state-sponsored services, including abor-\ntion, and vacating Ninth Circuit decision and re-\nmanding for reconsideration in light of Nat\u2019l Inst. of \nFam. & Life Advocs. v. Becerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018)). \nLiberty Counsel therefore has a vital interest in \nensuring that the Court decides this case by making \na clear distinction between talk therapy\u2014which is \npure speech protected by the First Amendment\u2014\nand invasive medical interventions involving con-\ntrolled drugs and surgery\u2014which are most often ap-\npropriately categorized as conduct that the state \nmay regulate.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThis case raises critical questions about the tiers \nof judicial scrutiny applied to laws that regulate \nmedical treatments involving dangerous drugs and \nexperimental surgery on the one hand, and, on the \nother hand, mental health counseling that involves \npure speech for minors who present with gender dys-\nphoria and unwanted sexual attractions, behaviors, \nand identity. Tennessee\u2019s law prohibiting certain \n\n \n \n \n3 \nexperimental invasive medical procedures, such as \ndangerous drugs and experimental surgeries for mi-\nnors, does not implicate a suspect class or impinge \nupon a fundamental right, and therefore the law \nwarrants only rational basis review. However, what-\never tier of scrutiny this Court determines is appli-\ncable in this case and those involving similar ques-\ntions, the Court should clearly limit its decision to \nlaws that regulate conduct\u2014invasive medical proce-\ndures like drugs and surgery\u2014not protected speech. \nAlthough this case involves an equal protection \nchallenge to Tennessee\u2019s law prohibiting certain off \nlabel use of dangerous drugs and experimental sur-\ngeries for minors, if not narrowly circumscribed the \nCourt\u2019s decision about the appropriate tier of scru-\ntiny could have broader implications for its First \nAmendment jurisprudence. If the Court applies a re-\nlaxed standard of review for laws prohibiting inva-\nsive medical procedures for minors, lower courts \nmay improperly use that precedent to also apply ra-\ntional basis review to laws banning therapeutic \ncounseling for minors who seek to align their iden-\ntity with their biological sex on the incorrect grounds \nthat both are forms of conduct, and this Court has \nalready determined that the latter is not. The deep-\nening circuit split over the proper level of judicial \nscrutiny applied to bans on such talk therapy, which \ninvolve only First-Amendment protected speech, \nhighlights the need for this Court to provide clear \nguidance on this issue.  \nDangerous and experimental medical procedures \nlike puberty blockers, cross-sex hormone drugs, and \nsurgery fall squarely within the state\u2019s traditional \nauthority to regulate public health and safety, and \n\n \n \n \n4 \nlaws regulating such conduct do not trigger height-\nened scrutiny. Prescribing drugs and performing in-\nvasive surgery is most often appropriately consid-\nered conduct, not speech. In contrast, therapeutic \ncounseling, or talk therapy, that helps minors align \ntheir attractions, feelings, identity, and behaviors to \ntheir religious or other values involves First Amend-\nment-protected speech, and any laws that prohibit \nsuch counseling are constitutionally suspect because \nthey are both content- and viewpoint-based.  \nIn short, by affirming the distinction between con-\nduct and speech, the Court can ensure that its First \nAmendment jurisprudence remains consistent inso-\nfar that content- and viewpoint-based laws are pre-\nsumptively unconstitutional. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Must Make a Clear Distinction \nBetween Invasive Medical Interventions \nInvolving \nDangerous \nDrugs \nand \nExperimental Surgeries, Which Are Most \nOften Appropriately Considered Conduct, \nand Counseling Involving Talk Therapy, \nWhich is Pure Speech. \nThis Court must preserve the essential distinction \nbetween laws that regulate conduct and those that \nrestrict speech. This Court\u2019s precedents have drawn \na line between the government\u2019s authority to govern \nconduct\u2014particularly in the realm of public health \nand safety\u2014and the heightened scrutiny required \nwhen the government discriminates against speech \non the basis of content or viewpoint.  \n\n \n \n \n5 \nLaws that prohibit speech because of its content or \nviewpoint automatically trigger strict scrutiny, re-\ngardless of the justification. Therefore, in the con-\ntext of laws regulating invasive medical interven-\ntions involving drugs and experimental surgeries, \nthis Court should be clear that they are most often \nappropriately considered conduct and subject to a \nrational basis standard, and they are not pure \nspeech, the regulation of which is subject to strict \nscrutiny. \nA. The Court\u2019s decision should make a clear \ndistinction between conduct and speech. \n Over the past fifty years, \u201cthe most important doc-\ntrinal development in the jurisprudence of constitu-\ntional rights has been the formulation, and prolifer-\nation, of \u2018tiers of scrutiny.\u2019\u201d Ashutosh Bhagwat, The \nTest That Ate Everything: Intermediate Scrutiny in \nFirst Amendment Jurisprudence, 2007 U. Ill. L. Rev. \n783, 784 (2007). \u201cTiered scrutiny\u201d refers to \u201cthe var-\nying levels of review courts use when deciding con-\nstitutional questions, and typically includes rational \nbasis review, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scru-\ntiny.\u201d John Inazu, First Amendment Scrutiny: Rea-\nligning First Amendment Doctrine Around Govern-\nment Interests, 89 Brook. L. Rev. 1, 52 n.102 (2023). \nAs one scholar explained, this Court created these \ntiers \u201cto formalize the jurisprudence of rights, and \nreconcile the general presumption of constitutional-\nity and deference to legislative bodies with the in-\nherently countermajoritarian nature of judicial re-\nview.\u201d Bhagwat, 2007 U. Ill. L. Rev. at 784. \nIn Equal Protection cases, this Court applies strict \nscrutiny to \u201cclassifications that disadvantage a \n\n \n \n \n6 \n\u2018suspect class,\u2019 or that impinge upon the exercise of \na \u2018fundamental right.\u2019\u201d Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, \n216\u201317 (1982) (cleaned up). Otherwise, the Court \n\u201cwill uphold the legislative classification so long as \nit bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.\u201d \nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996). In First \nAmendment speech cases, the Court applies strict \nscrutiny to content-based laws\u2014that is, laws \u201cthat \ntarget speech based on its communicative content,\u201d \nReed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015)\u2014\nand intermediate scrutiny to \u201ccontent-neutral re-\nstrictions that impose an incidental burden on \nspeech,\u201d see United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, \n376 (1968). \nGranted, the present case does not involve a First \nAmendment claim. But this Court has recognized \nthat \u201can equal protection claim\u201d can be \u201cclosely in-\ntertwined with First Amendment interests and that \ncontent-based restrictions on speech can violate \nequal protection. Police Dep\u2019t of City of Chicago v. \nMosley, 408 U.S. 92, 94\u201395 (1972); accord, Simon & \nSchuster, Inc. v. Members of New York State Crime \nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 124 (1991) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring in the judgment) (observing that the \nstrict scrutiny test applied to content-based speech \nrestrictions \u201cderives from our equal protection juris-\nprudence\u201d). That being so, although the present case \ninvolves an equal protection challenge to a state\u2019s \nlaw prohibiting certain invasive and experimental \nmedical interventions for minors including drugs \nand surgeries, the Court\u2019s decision on the appropri-\nate tier of scrutiny could reverberate beyond this \ncase. See, e.g., Tingley v. Ferguson, 144 S. Ct. 33, 34 \n(2023) (denying certiorari in First Amendment \n\n \n \n \n7 \nchallenge to the State of Washington\u2019s ban on ther-\napy to help gender-dysphoric minors align their feel-\nings with their biological sex); Nat\u2019l Inst. of Fam. & \nLife Advocs. v. Becerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018); Pickup \nv. Brown, 740 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir. 2014); King v. Gov-\nernor of the State of New Jersey, 767 F.3d 216 (3d \nCir. 2014). \nA ruling in this case that upholds a relaxed stand-\nard of review for laws targeting invasive and exper-\nimental medical procedures could mislead lower \ncourts to apply rational basis review to laws banning \ncounseling or talk therapy on the erroneous basis \nthat both types of legislation regulate conduct rather \nthan speech. Thus, Amicus urges the Court to be \nmindful of the broader implications that its decision \nin this case could have on its First Amendment ju-\nrisprudence, particularly in cases that involve laws \nregulating counseling involving only speech. \nIndeed, the Court\u2019s selection of a particular tier of \njudicial scrutiny in this matter could impact First \nAmendment challenges to bans on laws that prohibit \ncounseling that helps a client align unwanted attrac-\ntions, behavior, identity, or confusion with religious \nor other moral values. Therefore, the Court\u2019s appli-\ncation of a particular tier of scrutiny in this case \ncould set the framework for how lower courts scruti-\nnize laws that regulate counseling for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria or unwanted sexual attrac-\ntions, behaviors, and identity. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8 \nB. There is a deepening circuit split over the \nproper tier of judicial scrutiny applied to \ncounseling bans. \nThe danger of an inconsistent and erroneous tier \nof scrutiny is not speculative: There is already a \ndeepening circuit split over the level of judicial re-\nview accorded to laws that ban counseling or talk \ntherapy.2 \n The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that three lo-\ncal ordinances banning counseling regulated First \nAmendment-protected speech, and thus it held that \nthe ordinances were unconstitutional content- and \nviewpoint-based speech restrictions that failed to \nsatisfy strict scrutiny. See Otto v. City of Boca Raton, \n981 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. 2020) (striking Boca Raton \nand Palm Beach County ordinances on First Amend-\nment grounds). See also Vazzo v. City of Tampa, su-\npra, 2023 WL 1466603, at *1 (finding that \u201c[t]he City \nof Tampa\u2019s SOCE ordinance * * * is substantively \nthe same as the ordinances at issue in Otto\u201d and af-\nfirming district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment \nto counselors that challenged ordinance). The court \nof appeals in Otto found that the ordinances were \n\u201cplainly speaker-focused and content-based re-\nstrictions on speech: they limit a category of people\u2014\ntherapists\u2014from communicating a particular mes-\nsage.\u201d Id. at 863 (citation omitted). \u201cWhether ther-\napy is prohibited depends only on the content of the \n \n2 Such laws often use the terms \u201cconversion therapy\u201d or \u201csex-\nual orientation change efforts\u201d\u2014neither of which are counsel-\ning terms and neither term has been used by counselors to de-\nscribe their practice of counseling minors with unwanted same-\nsex attractions, behaviors, or identity. Rather, these terms are \nused for political purposes by proponents of such laws. \n\n \n \n \n9 \nwords used in that therapy, and the ban on that con-\ntent is because the government disagrees with it.\u201d \nId.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also rejected the govern-\nment-defendants\u2019 suggestion that the \u201cordinances \nhere\u2014even if based on the content of a therapist\u2019s \nspeech\u2014fall into a kind of twilight zone of \u2018profes-\nsional speech\u2019 or \u2018professional conduct.\u2019\u201d 981 F.3d at \n864\u201365. The court of appeals observed that \u201c[t]he \ngovernment cannot regulate speech by relabeling it \nas conduct.\u201d Id. at 865. And, most relevant here, it \nnoted that \u201cspeech-based SOCE\u201d is not a \u201cmedical \npractice\u201d but \u201ca client-directed conversation consist-\ning entirely of speech.\u201d Id. at 866 n.3; see also id. at \n865 (\u201cWhat the governments call a \u201cmedical proce-\ndure\u201d consists\u2014entirely\u2014of words.\u201d). \nFinally, relying on this Court\u2019s precedents, the \nEleventh Circuit rejected the argument that govern-\nments have the unfettered power to regulate \u201cprofes-\nsional speech.\u201d 981 F.3d at 866\u201367 (citation omit-\nted). The court of appeals observed that \u201c[t]he idea \nthat the ordinances target \u2018professional speech\u2019 does \nnot loosen the First Amendment\u2019s restraints.\u201d Id. at \n867. The court of appeals went on to hold that be-\ncause the ordinances were content-based regula-\ntions, they must survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 867\u2013\n68. Noting that strict scrutiny is a \u201cdemanding \nstandard,\u201d id. at 869 n.9 (quoting Brown v. Ent. Mer-\nchants Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, 799 (2011)), the court of \nappeals found that the government-defendants \nfailed to meet their burden of proving that the ordi-\nnances were narrowly tailored to further a compel-\nling interest in protecting minors from \u201cpurely \nspeech-based SOCE,\u201d id. at 868. \n\n \n \n \n10 \nIn Pickup v. Brown, however, the Ninth Circuit re-\nviewed California\u2019s law that similarly banned coun-\nseling under the rational basis standard, finding \nthat the law \u201cregulates conduct,\u201d specifically \u201cthera-\npeutic treatment.\u201d 740 F.3d 1208, 1229\u201330 (9th Cir. \n2014). In doing so, the Ninth Circuit observed that \n\u201cit is well recognized that a state enjoys considerable \nlatitude to regulate the conduct of its licensed health \ncare professionals in administering treatment.\u201d Id. \nat 1230 (citing Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, \n157 (2007)). The court of appeals found that the law \npassed First Amendment muster because it regu-\nlated \u201cprofessional conduct, where the state\u2019s power \nis great, even though such regulation may have an \nincidental effect on speech.\u201d Id. at 1229. The court of \nappeals went further, concluding that the law did \nnot even implicate the First Amendment because it \ntargeted only \u201ctreatment,\u201d which is merely conduct, \nand \u201cthe fact that speech may be used to carry out \nthose therapies does not turn the regulation of con-\nduct into a regulation of speech.\u201d Id. In other words, \nthe Ninth Circuit held that because talk therapy is \nactually conduct, the First Amendment offers no \nprotection for licensed therapists. See id. at 1231. \nIn King v. Governor of New Jersey, the Third Cir-\ncuit reviewed New Jersey\u2019s similar counseling ban \nunder intermediate scrutiny. See 767 F.3d 216, 234\u2013\n37 (3d Cir. 2014). The Third Circuit disagreed with \nthe Ninth Circuit and noted that \u201cverbal communi-\ncation that occurs during SOCE counseling is speech \nthat enjoys some degree of protection under the First \nAmendment.\u201d Id. at 224. But the court of appeals \nnevertheless upheld the law under intermediate \nscrutiny. The Third Circuit reasoned that the law \n\n \n \n \n11 \n\u201cwarrants lesser protection,\u201d id. at 232, because it \nregulated professional speech expressed while the \ncounselor provides \u201cpersonalized services to a client \nbased on the professional\u2019s expert knowledge.\u201d Id. at \n233 (concluding \u201cthat speech occurring as part of \nSOCE counseling is professional speech\u201d).  \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \nthe law \u201cdiscriminates on the basis of content,\u201d id. at \n236, it concluded that such discrimination was \u201cper-\nmissible\u201d because \u201c[t]he New Jersey legislature * * * \ntargeted SOCE counseling for prohibition because it \nwas presented with evidence that this particular \nform of counseling is ineffective and potentially \nharmful to clients, id. at 237. In other words, the \ncourt of appeals held that the state could discrimi-\nnate on the basis of content \u201cto protect its citizens \nfrom ineffective or harmful professional practices.\u201d \nId. The Third Circuit went on to uphold the law un-\nder intermediate scrutiny, finding that it \u201cdirectly \nadvances the government\u2019s interest in protecting cli-\nents from ineffective and/or harmful professional \nservices\u201d and is \u201csufficiently tailored\u201d to further that \nend. Id. at 237, 240.  \nAnother case that relied on the so-called \u201cprofes-\nsional speech\u201d doctrine was Moore-King v. County of \nChesterfield, 708 F.3d 560 (4th Cir. 2013). There, the \nFourth Circuit held that several county ordinances \nthat regulated fortune teller businesses did not vio-\nlate the First Amendment free expression rights of a \nself-described \u201cspiritual counselor.\u201d See 708 F.3d at \n569. The court of appeals held that \u201c[u]nder the pro-\nfessional speech doctrine, the government can li-\ncense and regulate those who would provide services \nto their clients for compensation without running \n\n \n \n \n12 \nafoul of the First Amendment.\u201d Id. The court of ap-\npeals concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cactivities fit \ncomfortably within the confines of professional \nspeech analysis\u201d because \u201cher psychic activities and \nspiritual counseling generally involve a personalized \nreading for a paying client.\u201d Id. \nThis Court identified by name and soundly and un-\nequivocally rejected the holdings of Pickup, King, \nand Moore-King in National Institute of Family & \nLife Advocates v. Becerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018) (\u201cNI-\nFLA\u201d). Observing that it \u201chas \u2018been reluctant to \nmark off new categories of speech for diminished \nconstitutional protection,\u2019\u201d id. at 767 (quoting Den-\nver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium, \nInc. v. F.C.C., 518 U.S. 727, 804 (1996) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring in part)), this Court noted that it \u201chas not \nrecognized \u2018professional speech\u2019 as a separate cate-\ngory of speech,\u201d id. \u201cAnd it has been especially reluc-\ntant to \u2018exemp[t] a category of speech from the nor-\nmal prohibition on content-based restrictions.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709, 722 \n(2012) (plurality opinion)). Under this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents, governments may not impose content-based \nrestrictions on speech without \u201cpersuasive evidence \nof a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition to \nthat effect.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). \nThis Court further observed that \u201c[t]he dangers as-\nsociated with content-based regulations of speech \nare\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n179: 20241011131752505_23-47720Amicus20Brief.json (score: 0.391)\nNo. 23-477\nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES \nCOURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\nA\n(800) 274-3321 \u2022 (800) 359-6859\nBRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE WOMEN\u2019S \nDECLARATION INTERNATIONAL USA  \nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS\n120024\nUNITED STATES,\nPetitioner,\nv.\nJONATHAN SKRMETTI, ATTORNEY GENERAL  \nAND REPORTER FOR TENNESSEE, et al.,\nRespondents.\nKARA DANSKY\nCounsel of Record\nWOMEN\u2019S DECLARATION  \nINTERNATIONAL USA\nP.O.

We are female human beings; this \nrecognition is demonstrably more accurate than notions \nfrom the framework of so-called \u201cgender identity.\u201d In \nfact, not a single one of us has a \u201cgender identity\u201d at all, \nnotwithstanding petitioner\u2019s absurd and utterly baseless \ncontention that \u201c[e]very person has a gender identity,\u201d \nCompl. in Intervention at 5, L.W., et al. v. Skrmetti, et al., \n3:23-cv-00376 (N.D.Tn. April 26, 2023).\nIt\u2019s a bit maddening to speak when the meaning of \nwords is up for grabs. In the case of the word \u201cwoman,\u201d \nfor example, it\u2019s almost as if we are using homonyms, two \nwords with the same sound but different meanings, one for \nthe standard meaning and another for the proposed new \nmeaning. For example, petitioner is essentially contending \nthat there are two types of women: one type of woman who \nis female and another type of woman who is male. This is a \nneat little linguistic trick, but it is not grounded in reality.\nFurthermore, proponents of \u201cgender identity\u201d often \nsay that sex and gender are different (we agree); other \ntimes they say that sex and gender are the same (we \ndisagree). Proponents of \u201cgender identity\u201d can never \n\n5\nmake any of their arguments make sense. But for them, \nthe point is not to make sense; the point is to play with \nmaterial reality and language. The entire ideology of \n\u201cgender identity\u201d is in the realm of faith, ignorance, and \nproclamation, in full contempt of any collaborative social \nreality with shared meanings. Entangled in our individual \ninner worlds, all people are meant to see our thoughts as \nfacts, shadows of concrete reality.\nFor serious users of (and people who care about the \naccurate use of ) language, \u201cwoman\u201d is a time-stable \nnoun that references one of the most basic categorical \ndistinctions society must acknowledge: sex. A woman is \nan adult human female, possibly a mother, or a sister, or \na lover.

Worse, our words for female members of the \nhuman community are being hollowed out simply to serve \nas vessels for the creation of new \u201cgender identities\u201d \nwith a seemingly endless set of behavioral and costume \npossibilities.

She warns: \u201cWhile \ntruth is not required in order for a belief to be protected, \nthe law needs to make distinctions between things that are \ntrue and things that are not. Reality and delusions cannot \nhold the same value or society descends into chaos.\u201d6\nWhen it comes to historical shifts in linguistic \nmeaning, some proposed changes are socially damaging. \nObserving that words can shift and change meaning over \ntime does not mean that all changes are rational or useful \nto all groups. Attempts to enshrine \u201cgender identity\u201d into \nlaw are bound to lead to confusion in society and harm \nespecially to women and girls, and especially lesbians. \nIt\u2019s clear which choice the law must make; it must be \npredicated on the (continued) existence of sex.\nFor all these reasons and the reasons set forth below, \namicus argues that: (I) The word \u201ctransgender\u201d is a \nlinguistic sleight of hand that cannot be protected legally \nas a quasi-suspect class under equal protection analysis \nbecause it has no coherent meaning, is not an immutable \ntrait, and does not describe a politically powerless group of \npeople; (II) Children have an international human right to \ngrow into adulthood and to be protected from the physical \nand psychological harms that result from suppressing \npuberty and/or administering opposite-sex hormones; \nand (III) Sex is grounded in material reality, whereas \n6.

WDI USA assumes that by \u201ctransgender\u201d \nand \u201ctransgender status\u201d in Bostock, the Court meant \nsomething along the lines of \u201cnot conforming to sex \nstereotypes\u201d because Aimee Stephens, the employee in \n\n9\nthat case who was terminated by his employer, was a \nman who did not conform to the stereotypes typically \nassociated with masculinity (see Section III, infra, on why \nsuch stereotypes are harmful).7\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which \nrepresents the respondents in support of the petitioner in \nWKLV\u0003PDWWHU\u000f\u0003GH\u00c0QHV\u0003WKH\u0003WHUP\u0003\u00b4WUDQVJHQGHU\u00b5\u0003WR\u0003PHDQ\u0003\u00b4D\u0003\nbroad range of identities and experiences that fall outside \nof the traditional understanding of gender.\u201d8 It continues: \n\u201cSome of those identities and experiences include people \nwhose gender identity is different from the sex they were \nassigned at birth, people who transition from living as \none gender to another or wish to do so (often described \nby the clinical term \u2018transsexual\u2019), people who \u2018cross-\ndress\u2019 part of the time, and people who identify outside \nthe traditional gender binary (meaning they identify as \nsomething other than male or female).

WFA has a unique \nand \nsignificant \nstatewide \npresence \nwith \nits \neducational and advocacy work in public policy and \nthe culture. WFA\u2019s interest in this case stems directly \nfrom its core issues. \n \nThe Illinois Family Institute (IFI) is a \nnonprofit educational and lobbying organization \nbased in Tinley Park, Illinois, that exists to advance \nlife, faith, family, and religious freedom in public \npolicy and culture from a Christian worldview.   \nThe \nInternational \nConference \nof \nEvangelical Chaplain Endorsers (ICECE) has as \nits main function to endorse chaplains to the military \nand other organizations requiring chaplains that do \nnot have a denominational structure to do so, avoiding \nthe entanglement with religion that the government \nwould otherwise have if it determined chaplain \nendorsements. ICECE safeguards religious liberty for \nall.  \nThe Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) is a non-\nprofit legal organization established under section \n501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Since its \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or \nin part.  No person or entity other than amici and their \ncounsel made a monetary contribution intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of this brief.   \n\n \n2  \n \nfounding in 1997, PJI has advised and represented in \ncourt and administrative proceedings thousands of \nindividuals, businesses, and religious institutions, \nparticularly in the realm of First Amendment and \nparental rights. PJI often represents teachers, \nparents, and their children to vindicate their \nconstitutional rights in public schools, including with \nrespect to children exhibiting as transgender. As such, \nPJI has a strong interest in the development of the \nlaw in this area. \n \nThe National Legal Foundation (NLF) is a \npublic interest law firm dedicated to the defense of \nfundamental parental rights and First Amendment \nliberties, including the freedoms of speech, assembly, \nand religion. The NLF and its donors and supporters, \nin particular those from Tennessee, are vitally \nconcerned with the outcome of this case because of its \neffect on the fundamental rights of parents and their \nminor children.  \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nTransgenderism \nis \nthis \ngeneration\u2019s \nphrenology, only it does more immediate harm. It is \nbased on incorrect philosophical assumptions and \npseudo-science. This Court\u2019s unfortunate opinion in \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), \ncommitted the cardinal logical error of assuming its \nconclusion. Its reasoning should be cabined, if not \ndisclaimed, and it should certainly not be extended to \nthe Equal Protection Clause. Application to that area \nwould actually undercut the clause\u2019s protections \nestablished for sex in appropriate circumstances. \n\n \n3  \n \nTransgenderism is a philosophy at war with itself, \nand it deserves no special constitutional protection. \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. \nBostock Was Based on a Logical Fallacy, \nand Its Pernicious Effect Should Be \nCabined, Not Extended \n \nThe United States\u2019 and L.W.\u2019s argument to \nextend equal protection guarantees to transgender \nindividuals is based on and follows this Court\u2019s \nreasoning in Bostock. (Pet. Br. at 21-28; L.W. Br. at \n23-32.) Bostock, however, committed the fundamental \nlogical error of assuming its conclusion,2 resulting in \nan interpretation of Title VII that would have \nastounded its enactors in 1964. See 590 U.S. at 683-\n99 (Alito, J., dissenting); id. at 780-81, 804 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). This case affords this \nCourt the opportunity to cabin the error of Bostock \nand to reason logically and in conformity with the \nadopters of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nIn contention in this case are two philosophical \nviews of reality. What Justice Blacklock of the Texas \nSupreme Court called the \u201cTransgender Vision\u201d \nclaims that all of us have a \u201csex assigned at birth\u201d that \nmay deviate from our inwardly felt \u201cgender identity.\u201d \nWhen a person\u2019s biological sex and gender identity \ndiverge, the Transgender Vision holds that a person \n \n2 This logical error is an example of circular reasoning and \nis also termed \u201cbegging the question\u201d and, in Latin, \u201cpetitio \nprincipii.\u201d \n\n \n4  \n \nshould normally give \u201cgender identity\u201d priority and, \nwhen that person does so, it would be \u201cunfair\u201d and \n\u201cunjust\u201d not to recognize the person as the gender \nthey have selected, as if they had been born that way. \nConversely, what Justice Blacklock termed the \n\u201cTraditional Vision\u201d sees things quite differently. Sex \nis not \u201cassigned at birth,\u201d but is an innate and \nimmutable characteristic that cannot be altered by a \nmental desire or inclination. Thus, we as individuals \ndo not decide whether to \u201cidentify\u201d as male or female; \nwe are male or female, whatever we feel about the \nmatter.3 The Petitioners refer to this as a difference \nbetween subjective and objective visions of reality.  \n \nIn a key passage in Bostock, this Court stated \nas follows:  \n \nOr take an employer who fires a transgender \nperson who was identified as a male at birth \nbut who now identifies as a female. If the \nemployer \nretains \nan \notherwise \nidentical \nemployee who was identified as female at birth, \nthe employer intentionally penalizes a person \nidentified as male at birth for traits or actions \nthat it tolerates in an employee identified as \nfemale at birth.  \n \n590 U.S. at 660. The problem with this reasoning is \nthat it assumes the reality and veracity of the \nTransgender Vision, i.e., that a male who \u201cidentifies\u201d \n \n3 State v. Loe, 67 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1421, 2024 WL 3219030 \nat *15-*16 (June 28, 2024) (Blacklock, J., concurring). \n\n \n5  \n \nas a woman is \u201cidentical\u201d to a female who \u201cidentifies\u201d \nas a woman. From this starting point, the Bostock \nmajority expanded that, taking two similarly situated \nemployees, one a male at birth now identifying as a \nfemale and the other a female at birth who still \nidentifies as female, if the employer fires only the \nformer, biological \u201csex plays an unmistakable and \nimpermissible role\u201d in the action. Id.   \n \nIf the only thing that mattered was how \npersons \u201cidentify\u201d themselves subjectively, then a \nmale who identifies as female and a female who does \nthe same would be similarly situated. But to charge \nan employer with discrimination based on sex (rather \nthan gender) discrimination because it fired the male \nwho identifies as a female, one has to switch back to \nthat person really being male (his biological sex) while \npresenting as female (his preferred gender). For there \nto be a true correlation, the female similarly situated \nhas to be presenting as the male gender, i.e., as a \ngender other than her biological sex. If the employer \nfired males presenting as females but did not fire \nfemales presenting as males, then you would have sex \ndiscrimination.4 \nSee \nid. \nat \n697-98 \n(Alito, \nJ., \ndissenting) (demonstrating majority\u2019s illogical \u201cbattle \nof labels\u201d). The Bostock majority\u2019s holding that an \n \n4 Of course, this reflects the underlying philosophical \ntension in transgenderism. It holds that physical sex is not \nthe \u201creal\u201d person but then defines the \u201creal\u201d person as the \nother physical sex. And there is no reason that a subjective \n\u201cgender\u201d feeling cannot change, as detransitioners show. \nThe philosophical tension generated by transgenderism is \ndiscussed further in part II, infra. \n\n \n6  \n \nemployee proves discrimination simply by showing \nthat an employer took biological sex into account \nwhen firing him, see id. at 657-58, or that he was fired \n\u201cfor traits or actions [the employer] would not have \nquestioned in members of a different sex [who \npresented in accord with their sex],\u201d id. at 652, simply \ndoes not follow. \n \nLogical \nfallacies \noften \nhave \nunintended \nrepercussions, and that is true here. See id. at 804 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (prognosticating that the \nmajority \ndecision \nwill \n\u201clikely \nreverberate \nin \nunpredictable ways for years to come\u201d). A simple \nexample shows the error of the Bostock majority\u2019s \nreasoning.  \n \nSuppose a male employee, Bob, who does not \nidentify as female, is discharged because he \nrepeatedly enters the women\u2019s restroom and locker \nroom. Using the reasoning of Bostock, his firing \nviolates Title VII: because women are not fired for \nentering the women\u2019s restroom and locker room, but \nonly he as a man, biological \u201csex plays an \nunmistakable \nand \nimpermissible \nrole\u201d \nin \nhis \ndischarge. Id. at 660. And taking the Bostock \nrationale further, it does no good for the employer to \nargue that it also fired Heather, who is a female who \nidentifies as such, because she repeatedly entered the \nmen\u2019s restroom and locker room, as her discharge, too, \nnecessarily made reference to her biological sex. Bob \ninvading the women\u2019s room and Heather invading the \nmen\u2019s room would each have been disciplined taking \ninto account their sex, or, to use Bostock\u2019s \nformulation, because of \u201cactions [the employer] would \nnot have questioned in members of a different sex.\u201d \n\n \n7  \n \nId. at 652. That their employer applied a rule \nforbidding all employees to go into the other sex\u2019s \nrestroom and locker room does not cure the problem \nunder Bostock because, it instructs, Title VII protects \nan individual. Id. at 659. \u201cInstead of avoiding Title VII \nexposure, this employer doubles it.\u201d Id. As this \nillustration demonstrates, the Bostock rationale \ndoesn\u2019t work, unless one wants to indulge the \npreposterous presumption that Congress, whether it \nknew it at the time or not, was mandating open-sex \nrestrooms and locker rooms by all covered employers. \n \nThe proper comparison for \u201csex\u201d discrimination \nis between male and female, not between those who \npresent as male (no matter their sex) and those who \ndo not. Thus, Bostock was wrong because the \nemployers did not discriminate on the basis of sex: \nthey took action against both men and women equally \nwhen they presented as transgender. See 590 U.S. at \n698-99 (Alito, J., dissenting). \u201cBostock\u2019s logic cannot \nstand if a person\u2019s declaration of a transgender \nidentity is understood as a misguided break from \nreality, as it was by nearly everyone in 1964\u2014rather \nthan as a revelation of reality, as it is by some people \ntoday.\u201d5 \n \n \n5 State v. Loe, 2024 WL 3219030 at *19 (Blacklock, J., \nconcurring). The majority opinion in Loe refused to \nextend Bostock\u2019s reasoning to the Equal Protection Clause \nand held that the Texas statute prohibiting certain \ntransgender-related surgeries on minors did not violate the \nclause.  Id. at *13-*15 (finding that transgenderism was \nneither the equivalent of sex for equal protection purposes \nnor a protected class). \n\n \n8  \n \nThe issue of whether a male identifying as \nfemale is in the same position as a biological female \nfor Equal Protection Clause purposes cannot be \nanswered simply by assuming the accuracy of the \nTransgender Vision, i.e., that people actually are the \nsex they subjectively claim they are. Those who \nadopted the Fourteenth Amendment certainly did not \nmake any such assumption. They unquestionably \nheld to the Traditional Vision, that boys are boys and \ngirls are girls, whatever they might feel, think, or \ndesire. Thus, transgender \u201cgirls\u201d and real girls are not \nin the same class on a physical, philosophical, or \nlogical basis. This Court should not infect its Equal \nProtection Clause jurisprudence with the misguided, \ncircular reasoning it used in Bostock. \n \nII. \nGranting \nTransgender \nIndividuals \nProtected Status Would Erode Equal \nProtection for Sex, and Particularly for \nWomen  \n \nThe Transgender Vision as a philosophy is at \nwar with itself, as well as with reality. If sex is fluid, \nthen, at the end of the day, there is no such thing as \nan immutable sex characteristic and no common \nground on which to describe and differentiate the \nsexes. For this reason, some in the homosexual rights \nmovement have spoken against the transgender \nmovement.  \n \nReferring to the common LGBTQ+ acronym, \nProfessor Carl Trueman describes the present \ncultural phenomenon as \u201cThe Triumph of the T.\u201d Carl \nTrueman, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self \n\n \n9  \n \n339-78 \n(2020). \nHe \npoints \nout \nthat \n\u201cboth \ntransgenderism and queer theory are predicated on a \nbasic denial of the fixed nature of gender, something \nthat the L and the G by contrast assume.\u201d Id. at 340-\n41. While those encompassed by LGBTQ+ have forged \na political coalition based on victimhood, id. at 353-57, \nTrueman also reports that \u201cthe status of transgender \npeople is today a matter of acrimonious dispute \namong those who have campaigned for women\u2019s \nrights.\u201d Id. at 357. Trueman summarizes the work of \nfeminist Janice Raymond as follows: \n \nthough what constitutes female identity \n(gender) in different times and different \ncultures may vary greatly, these various \nidentities are connected to common forms of \nbodily \nexperience. \nTo \nreject \nthat, \nas \ntransgenderism does, is to move gender \nentirely into the realm of the psychological and \nto deny, in a quasi-gnostic fashion, any \nsignificance to the body. \n \n. . . . Being a woman is now something that can \nbe \nproduced \nby \na \ntechnique\u2014literally \nprescribed by a doctor. The pain, the struggle, \nand the history of oppression that shape what \nit means to be a woman in society are thus \ntrivialized and rendered irrelevant. \n \nTrueman puts the point succinctly: \u201cas soon as \nbiology is discounted as being one decisive factor of \nsignificance for identity, the L, the G, and the B are \nalso destabilized as meaningful categories.\u201d Id. at 362. \n\n \n10  \n \nAnd again, \u201cIf gender is completely psychologized and \nsevered from biological sex, then categories built on \nthe old male-female binary cease to be relevant . . . .\u201d \nId. \nat \n365. \nTaken \nto \nits \nlogical \nextreme, \ntransgenderism makes distinctions based on the \nbinary of male-female sex meaningless. \n \nThis Court has recognized that, for many \npurposes (although not all), the sex of an individual is \nnot of consequence and the government may not \ndistinguish among individuals on the basis of sex \nwithout violating the Equal Protection Clause. See \nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) \n(\u201cthe sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to \nability to perform or contribute to society\u201d); Reed v. \nReed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971). That precedent is based on \nthe (accurate) assumptions that sex is not a personal \nselection, but immutable. See id.; see also Nguyen v. \nINS, 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001); United States v. Va., 518 \nU.S. 515, 533 (1996). If the Transgender Vision is \ncorrect, that foundational premise about sex is \ninaccurate, and protection of sex as a classification for \nequal protection must fall. If there is no immutable \nversion of sex, but only an infinitely modulating sense \nof gender identity, then there is no fixed sex to protect \nfor Equal Protection Clause purposes and no traits \nand attributes that can be attributed to one sex versus \nthe other on which to base a claim of discrimination. \n \nThe \nbasic \ninconsistency \nin \ntransgender \nphilosophy works itself out in cases involving minors \nas follows: government actors that assist minors \ntransition genders, such as public schools and foster \n\n \n11  \n \ncare agencies, simultaneously insist that (a) minors \nare mature enough to make this life-changing \ndecision for themselves and (b) these same minors are \nso sensitive that anyone that doesn\u2019t immediately \naffirm their transgender impulse by using their newly \nminted names and faux pronouns causes them \ncrushing emotional trauma. This attempt to shut \ndown any expressed disagreement with their \u201cnewly \ndiscovered self\u201d runs directly counter, of course, to \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nlong-established \ncase \nlaw \nthat \ndisagreement with the ideas expressed by others \nprovides no warrant to stifle their speech.  See Matal \nv. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 244 (2017) (Alito, J., plurality \nop.) (collecting cases). It also demonstrates the \nphilosophy\u2019s own weakness, as any theory that must \nbe propped up by having it both ways is intellectually \nbankrupt and certainly unworthy of constitutional \nprotection. \n \nThe fixed star of transgenderism is the \nindividual self, and this turns out to be no star at all. \nIf individuals, simply by thinking about it, are free to \nchange genders once, they are free to do so multiple \ntimes, as detransitioners demonstrate. And if the \nmind may override the physical attributes of the body \nin this way, why is there any need to try to \napproximate another gender physically in the first \nplace? If gender is not fixed, but fluid, then it should \nnot matter what body one has. Yet, transgender \nindividuals seek to take on the appearance and even \nattributes of a body that they say has no fixed reality. \nIronically, the attributes of the other sex to which \nthey aspire turn out to be the stereotypical attributes \n\n \n12  \n \nwhich \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nfound \nindicative \nof \nunconstitutional sex discrimination.  See, e.g., Va., \n518 U.S. at 549-51; Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, \n458 U.S. 718, 725 (1982); Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 684-\n85. \n \nA philosophy at war with itself, at war with \nreality, and at war against the affected individual\u2019s \nown body has no claims on permanency. If this Court \nwere to adopt transgenderism as a dominant cultural \nand constitutional philosophy, it would necessarily \nportend the crumbling of the category of physical sex, \nultimately emasculating the current protections for \nthat status.  \n \nIII. \nTransgenderism Should Not Be Granted \nAny Type of Protected Status \n \nWe leave largely to others to elaborate on the \nobvious: transgenderism does not qualify for protected \nstatus under any test previously used by this Court.  \nMoreover, we will leave to others the battle of the \nsocial science studies, while noting that the tide has \nmarkedly turned against the efficacy of \u201cgender-\naffirming\u201d care via pharmaceuticals and surgeries.  \n \nWe do wish to point out something else that is \nboth \nobvious \nand \nsettled \nbiological \nscience: \nindividuals are made either male or female at \nconception. They have either XY chromosomes in all \nof the trillions of cells in their mature body (except for \nred blood cells and reproductive cells), in which case \nthey are male, or XX chromosomes, in which case they \n\n \n13  \n \nare female. No pharmaceutical or surgical procedure \ncan or will ever change that basic, biological fact.  \n \nTransgenderism is just as irrational as \u201ctrans-\nstaturism,\u201d explained by the following example: I am \nsix feet tall. However, no matter what the tape \nmeasure says, I have a deep inner understanding that \nI am really 6\u201911\u201d, and that\u2019s the height that I believe \nmyself to be. I do not believe anyone has a right to tell \nme what height I am, because I am the one who \ndecides for myself what my inner self is and is meant \nto be. Thus, I also have a right to have surgery to \nlengthen my limbs and have my physical body \ncorrespond to my mental understanding of who I \nreally am. I also believe I have the right to require \nothers to treat me as 6\u201911\u201d and to seek legal relief \nagainst those who fail to do so. \n \nIf I expressed these thoughts widely and \nsincerely, I would be considered irrational and \nmentally unfit. That\u2019s exactly what I would be. It is no \ndifferent with respect to transgender individuals.6  \n \nFinally, the operating assumption of those \nrequiring adolescents to be affirmed in exhibiting as \ntransgender is flawed. We will leave to others the \ncataloguing of studies and their findings. We note, \n \n6 Another example would be \u201ctrans-ageism.\u201d Even though \nunder 60, could someone rationally claim that they \nconsider themselves to be 65 and entitled immediately to \nretirement benefits? Or a 16-year-old claim he considers \nhimself 21 and so able to procure and consume alcoholic \nbeverages? \n\n \n14  \n \nhowever, what we believe is uncontroverted: that \nchildren who express discomfort with their biological \nsex also present with other symptoms such as anxiety \nand suicidal ideation. As the United States puts it, \n\u201ceveryone agrees [that gender confusion] is a serious \nmedical condition.\u201d (Pet. Br. at 31.) The question that \npresents itself is whether exhibiting as transgender \nwill cure these children or whether their gender \nconfusion is simply another symptom of their \nunstable psychological condition. Those who advocate \nfor aggressively treating children as transgender, \neven when pre-pubescent and even to the extent of \ntaking non-reversible pharmaceutical and surgical \nsteps, adopt the presumption that exhibiting as \ntransgender will cure the other mental ills of the \nchild. That is certainly not something that can be \nknown a priori, and it is just as logical to assume that \ngender confusion is just another symptom of other \nmental conditions. Indeed, the most recent and \nreliable studies show that the overall mental health \nof those who transition, including those upon whom \nmedical procedures are performed, does not improve \nover time.7 \n \nThose clamoring for a protected status for those \nexhibiting as transgender are seeking to have this \nCourt assume this same, faulty predicate that \nexhibiting as transgender will cure a child\u2019s mental \nproblems. But this issue should not be moved from \nlegislative chambers to the courtroom. If this Court \n \n7 See, e.g., studies collected in Amicus Brief of Society for \nEvidence-Based Gender Medicine. \n\n \n15  \n \ndid so by constitutionalizing the faulty assumption \nthat \npharmaceutical \nand \nsurgical \ntransgender \ninterventions are sometimes medically necessary for \nminors, as the United States urges (Pet. Br. at 31-49), \nit would do grave harm to both individuals and our \nsystem of government. \n \nFor the Equal Protection Clause to operate, the \nparties have to be \u201cin all relevant respects alike.\u201d \nNordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). The simple, \nunalterable fact is that a person who presents as male \nbut has female reproductive organs and chromosomes \nis not \u201cin all relevant respects alike\u201d to a person who \npresents as male and has the reproductive organs and \nchromosomes to match. That difference is the very \nreason that the former person is called \u201ctransgender\u201d \nand the latter is not. By definition, those who exhibit \nas transgender and those who do not are in that very \nrespect not \u201cin all respects alike.\u201d Id. Biological males \nand females are \u201cnot fungible.\u201d Ballard v. United \nStates, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946). Neither are females \nfungible with biological males presenting as females. \n\u201cGender identity\u201d does not equate to \u201csex,\u201d and it \nnever will. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n\u201cTransgenderism\u201d \nand \n\u201cgender \nidentity\u201d \ndiscrimination \nare \nnot \nthe \nsame \nas \n\u201csex\u201d \ndiscrimination, and they have no protected status \nunder the Equal Protection Clause.

Lib-\nerty Counsel engages in strategic litigation to pro-\ntect the freedom of speech of professionals, busi-\nnessowners, ministers, and ordinary Americans \nfrom all walks of life. Liberty Counsel attorneys \nhave represented clients before this Court, federal \ncircuit courts of appeals, and federal and state trial \ncourts nationwide. Liberty Counsel attorneys also \nhave spoken or testified before Congress on matters \nrelating to government infringement on First \nAmendment rights. \nAs part of its mission, Liberty Counsel has repre-\nsented or provided legal counsel to numerous li-\ncensed counselors who diagnose and treat patients \nwith emotional and mental disorders and dysfunc-\ntions (whether cognitive, affective, behavioral, or \nsexual), including patients with unwanted same-sex \nattractions, behaviors, or identity, and gender dys-\nphoria. These counselors exclusively use talk ther-\napy whereby the client expresses his or her stressor \nto the counselor, and the counselor and client talk to \nhelp the client achieve their self-determined objec-\ntive. To that end, Liberty Counsel has challenged on \nFirst Amendment grounds several state and local \nlaws that prohibit counselors from using talk ther-\napy to help their clients explore their unwanted \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no person other than Amicus or its counsel made a \nmonetary contribution intended to fund this brief\u2019s preparation \nor submission. \n\n \n \n \n2 \nsexual attractions, behaviors, or confusion. See, e.g., \nOtto v. City of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. \n2020); Vazzo v. City of Tampa, No. 19-14387, 2023 \nWL 1466603 (11th Cir. Feb. 2, 2023); King v. Gover-\nnor of the State of New Jersey, 767 F.3d 216 (3d Cir. \n2014), cert denied sub nom., King v. Christie, 575 \nU.S. 996 (2015); Pickup v. Brown, 740 F.3d 1208 (9th \nCir. 2014), cert denied, 573 U.S. 945 (2014). See also \nMountain Right to Life, Inc. v. Becerra, 585 U.S. \n1027 (2018) (granting petition for writ of certiorari \nin challenge to California law that mandated crisis \npregnancy centers to notify women about the avail-\nability of state-sponsored services, including abor-\ntion, and vacating Ninth Circuit decision and re-\nmanding for reconsideration in light of Nat\u2019l Inst. of \nFam. & Life Advocs. v. Becerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018)). \nLiberty Counsel therefore has a vital interest in \nensuring that the Court decides this case by making \na clear distinction between talk therapy\u2014which is \npure speech protected by the First Amendment\u2014\nand invasive medical interventions involving con-\ntrolled drugs and surgery\u2014which are most often ap-\npropriately categorized as conduct that the state \nmay regulate.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThis case raises critical questions about the tiers \nof judicial scrutiny applied to laws that regulate \nmedical treatments involving dangerous drugs and \nexperimental surgery on the one hand, and, on the \nother hand, mental health counseling that involves \npure speech for minors who present with gender dys-\nphoria and unwanted sexual attractions, behaviors, \nand identity. Tennessee\u2019s law prohibiting certain \n\n \n \n \n3 \nexperimental invasive medical procedures, such as \ndangerous drugs and experimental surgeries for mi-\nnors, does not implicate a suspect class or impinge \nupon a fundamental right, and therefore the law \nwarrants only rational basis review. However, what-\never tier of scrutiny this Court determines is appli-\ncable in this case and those involving similar ques-\ntions, the Court should clearly limit its decision to \nlaws that regulate conduct\u2014invasive medical proce-\ndures like drugs and surgery\u2014not protected speech. \nAlthough this case involves an equal protection \nchallenge to Tennessee\u2019s law prohibiting certain off \nlabel use of dangerous drugs and experimental sur-\ngeries for minors, if not narrowly circumscribed the \nCourt\u2019s decision about the appropriate tier of scru-\ntiny could have broader implications for its First \nAmendment jurisprudence. If the Court applies a re-\nlaxed standard of review for laws prohibiting inva-\nsive medical procedures for minors, lower courts \nmay improperly use that precedent to also apply ra-\ntional basis review to laws banning therapeutic \ncounseling for minors who seek to align their iden-\ntity with their biological sex on the incorrect grounds \nthat both are forms of conduct, and this Court has \nalready determined that the latter is not. The deep-\nening circuit split over the proper level of judicial \nscrutiny applied to bans on such talk therapy, which \ninvolve only First-Amendment protected speech, \nhighlights the need for this Court to provide clear \nguidance on this issue.  \nDangerous and experimental medical procedures \nlike puberty blockers, cross-sex hormone drugs, and \nsurgery fall squarely within the state\u2019s traditional \nauthority to regulate public health and safety, and \n\n \n \n \n4 \nlaws regulating such conduct do not trigger height-\nened scrutiny. Prescribing drugs and performing in-\nvasive surgery is most often appropriately consid-\nered conduct, not speech. In contrast, therapeutic \ncounseling, or talk therapy, that helps minors align \ntheir attractions, feelings, identity, and behaviors to \ntheir religious or other values involves First Amend-\nment-protected speech, and any laws that prohibit \nsuch counseling are constitutionally suspect because \nthey are both content- and viewpoint-based.  \nIn short, by affirming the distinction between con-\nduct and speech, the Court can ensure that its First \nAmendment jurisprudence remains consistent inso-\nfar that content- and viewpoint-based laws are pre-\nsumptively unconstitutional. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Must Make a Clear Distinction \nBetween Invasive Medical Interventions \nInvolving \nDangerous \nDrugs \nand \nExperimental Surgeries, Which Are Most \nOften Appropriately Considered Conduct, \nand Counseling Involving Talk Therapy, \nWhich is Pure Speech. \nThis Court must preserve the essential distinction \nbetween laws that regulate conduct and those that \nrestrict speech. This Court\u2019s precedents have drawn \na line between the government\u2019s authority to govern \nconduct\u2014particularly in the realm of public health \nand safety\u2014and the heightened scrutiny required \nwhen the government discriminates against speech \non the basis of content or viewpoint.  \n\n \n \n \n5 \nLaws that prohibit speech because of its content or \nviewpoint automatically trigger strict scrutiny, re-\ngardless of the justification. Therefore, in the con-\ntext of laws regulating invasive medical interven-\ntions involving drugs and experimental surgeries, \nthis Court should be clear that they are most often \nappropriately considered conduct and subject to a \nrational basis standard, and they are not pure \nspeech, the regulation of which is subject to strict \nscrutiny. \nA. The Court\u2019s decision should make a clear \ndistinction between conduct and speech. \n Over the past fifty years, \u201cthe most important doc-\ntrinal development in the jurisprudence of constitu-\ntional rights has been the formulation, and prolifer-\nation, of \u2018tiers of scrutiny.\u2019\u201d Ashutosh Bhagwat, The \nTest That Ate Everything: Intermediate Scrutiny in \nFirst Amendment Jurisprudence, 2007 U. Ill. L. Rev. \n783, 784 (2007). \u201cTiered scrutiny\u201d refers to \u201cthe var-\nying levels of review courts use when deciding con-\nstitutional questions, and typically includes rational \nbasis review, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scru-\ntiny.\u201d John Inazu, First Amendment Scrutiny: Rea-\nligning First Amendment Doctrine Around Govern-\nment Interests, 89 Brook. L. Rev. 1, 52 n.102 (2023). \nAs one scholar explained, this Court created these \ntiers \u201cto formalize the jurisprudence of rights, and \nreconcile the general presumption of constitutional-\nity and deference to legislative bodies with the in-\nherently countermajoritarian nature of judicial re-\nview.\u201d Bhagwat, 2007 U. Ill. L. Rev. at 784. \nIn Equal Protection cases, this Court applies strict \nscrutiny to \u201cclassifications that disadvantage a \n\n \n \n \n6 \n\u2018suspect class,\u2019 or that impinge upon the exercise of \na \u2018fundamental right.\u2019\u201d Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, \n216\u201317 (1982) (cleaned up). Otherwise, the Court \n\u201cwill uphold the legislative classification so long as \nit bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.\u201d \nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996). In First \nAmendment speech cases, the Court applies strict \nscrutiny to content-based laws\u2014that is, laws \u201cthat \ntarget speech based on its communicative content,\u201d \nReed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015)\u2014\nand intermediate scrutiny to \u201ccontent-neutral re-\nstrictions that impose an incidental burden on \nspeech,\u201d see United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, \n376 (1968). \nGranted, the present case does not involve a First \nAmendment claim. But this Court has recognized \nthat \u201can equal protection claim\u201d can be \u201cclosely in-\ntertwined with First Amendment interests and that \ncontent-based restrictions on speech can violate \nequal protection. Police Dep\u2019t of City of Chicago v. \nMosley, 408 U.S. 92, 94\u201395 (1972); accord, Simon & \nSchuster, Inc. v. Members of New York State Crime \nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 124 (1991) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring in the judgment) (observing that the \nstrict scrutiny test applied to content-based speech \nrestrictions \u201cderives from our equal protection juris-\nprudence\u201d). That being so, although the present case \ninvolves an equal protection challenge to a state\u2019s \nlaw prohibiting certain invasive and experimental \nmedical interventions for minors including drugs \nand surgeries, the Court\u2019s decision on the appropri-\nate tier of scrutiny could reverberate beyond this \ncase. See, e.g., Tingley v. Ferguson, 144 S. Ct. 33, 34 \n(2023) (denying certiorari in First Amendment \n\n \n \n \n7 \nchallenge to the State of Washington\u2019s ban on ther-\napy to help gender-dysphoric minors align their feel-\nings with their biological sex); Nat\u2019l Inst. of Fam. & \nLife Advocs. v. Becerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018); Pickup \nv. Brown, 740 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir. 2014); King v. Gov-\nernor of the State of New Jersey, 767 F.3d 216 (3d \nCir. 2014). \nA ruling in this case that upholds a relaxed stand-\nard of review for laws targeting invasive and exper-\nimental medical procedures could mislead lower \ncourts to apply rational basis review to laws banning \ncounseling or talk therapy on the erroneous basis \nthat both types of legislation regulate conduct rather \nthan speech. Thus, Amicus urges the Court to be \nmindful of the broader implications that its decision \nin this case could have on its First Amendment ju-\nrisprudence, particularly in cases that involve laws \nregulating counseling involving only speech. \nIndeed, the Court\u2019s selection of a particular tier of \njudicial scrutiny in this matter could impact First \nAmendment challenges to bans on laws that prohibit \ncounseling that helps a client align unwanted attrac-\ntions, behavior, identity, or confusion with religious \nor other moral values. Therefore, the Court\u2019s appli-\ncation of a particular tier of scrutiny in this case \ncould set the framework for how lower courts scruti-\nnize laws that regulate counseling for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria or unwanted sexual attrac-\ntions, behaviors, and identity. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8 \nB. There is a deepening circuit split over the \nproper tier of judicial scrutiny applied to \ncounseling bans. \nThe danger of an inconsistent and erroneous tier \nof scrutiny is not speculative: There is already a \ndeepening circuit split over the level of judicial re-\nview accorded to laws that ban counseling or talk \ntherapy.2 \n The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that three lo-\ncal ordinances banning counseling regulated First \nAmendment-protected speech, and thus it held that \nthe ordinances were unconstitutional content- and \nviewpoint-based speech restrictions that failed to \nsatisfy strict scrutiny. See Otto v. City of Boca Raton, \n981 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. 2020) (striking Boca Raton \nand Palm Beach County ordinances on First Amend-\nment grounds). See also Vazzo v. City of Tampa, su-\npra, 2023 WL 1466603, at *1 (finding that \u201c[t]he City \nof Tampa\u2019s SOCE ordinance * * * is substantively \nthe same as the ordinances at issue in Otto\u201d and af-\nfirming district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment \nto counselors that challenged ordinance). The court \nof appeals in Otto found that the ordinances were \n\u201cplainly speaker-focused and content-based re-\nstrictions on speech: they limit a category of people\u2014\ntherapists\u2014from communicating a particular mes-\nsage.\u201d Id. at 863 (citation omitted). \u201cWhether ther-\napy is prohibited depends only on the content of the \n \n2 Such laws often use the terms \u201cconversion therapy\u201d or \u201csex-\nual orientation change efforts\u201d\u2014neither of which are counsel-\ning terms and neither term has been used by counselors to de-\nscribe their practice of counseling minors with unwanted same-\nsex attractions, behaviors, or identity. Rather, these terms are \nused for political purposes by proponents of such laws. \n\n \n \n \n9 \nwords used in that therapy, and the ban on that con-\ntent is because the government disagrees with it.\u201d \nId.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also rejected the govern-\nment-defendants\u2019 suggestion that the \u201cordinances \nhere\u2014even if based on the content of a therapist\u2019s \nspeech\u2014fall into a kind of twilight zone of \u2018profes-\nsional speech\u2019 or \u2018professional conduct.\u2019\u201d 981 F.3d at \n864\u201365. The court of appeals observed that \u201c[t]he \ngovernment cannot regulate speech by relabeling it \nas conduct.\u201d Id. at 865. And, most relevant here, it \nnoted that \u201cspeech-based SOCE\u201d is not a \u201cmedical \npractice\u201d but \u201ca client-directed conversation consist-\ning entirely of speech.\u201d Id. at 866 n.3; see also id. at \n865 (\u201cWhat the governments call a \u201cmedical proce-\ndure\u201d consists\u2014entirely\u2014of words.\u201d). \nFinally, relying on this Court\u2019s precedents, the \nEleventh Circuit rejected the argument that govern-\nments have the unfettered power to regulate \u201cprofes-\nsional speech.\u201d 981 F.3d at 866\u201367 (citation omit-\nted). The court of appeals observed that \u201c[t]he idea \nthat the ordinances target \u2018professional speech\u2019 does \nnot loosen the First Amendment\u2019s restraints.\u201d Id. at \n867. The court of appeals went on to hold that be-\ncause the ordinances were content-based regula-\ntions, they must survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 867\u2013\n68. Noting that strict scrutiny is a \u201cdemanding \nstandard,\u201d id. at 869 n.9 (quoting Brown v. Ent. Mer-\nchants Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, 799 (2011)), the court of \nappeals found that the government-defendants \nfailed to meet their burden of proving that the ordi-\nnances were narrowly tailored to further a compel-\nling interest in protecting minors from \u201cpurely \nspeech-based SOCE,\u201d id. at 868. \n\n \n \n \n10 \nIn Pickup v. Brown, however, the Ninth Circuit re-\nviewed California\u2019s law that similarly banned coun-\nseling under the rational basis standard, finding \nthat the law \u201cregulates conduct,\u201d specifically \u201cthera-\npeutic treatment.\u201d 740 F.3d 1208, 1229\u201330 (9th Cir. \n2014). In doing so, the Ninth Circuit observed that \n\u201cit is well recognized that a state enjoys considerable \nlatitude to regulate the conduct of its licensed health \ncare professionals in administering treatment.\u201d Id. \nat 1230 (citing Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, \n157 (2007)). The court of appeals found that the law \npassed First Amendment muster because it regu-\nlated \u201cprofessional conduct, where the state\u2019s power \nis great, even though such regulation may have an \nincidental effect on speech.\u201d Id. at 1229. The court of \nappeals went further, concluding that the law did \nnot even implicate the First Amendment because it \ntargeted only \u201ctreatment,\u201d which is merely conduct, \nand \u201cthe fact that speech may be used to carry out \nthose therapies does not turn the regulation of con-\nduct into a regulation of speech.\u201d Id. In other words, \nthe Ninth Circuit held that because talk therapy is \nactually conduct, the First Amendment offers no \nprotection for licensed therapists. See id. at 1231. \nIn King v. Governor of New Jersey, the Third Cir-\ncuit reviewed New Jersey\u2019s similar counseling ban \nunder intermediate scrutiny. See 767 F.3d 216, 234\u2013\n37 (3d Cir. 2014). The Third Circuit disagreed with \nthe Ninth Circuit and noted that \u201cverbal communi-\ncation that occurs during SOCE counseling is speech \nthat enjoys some degree of protection under the First \nAmendment.\u201d Id. at 224. But the court of appeals \nnevertheless upheld the law under intermediate \nscrutiny. The Third Circuit reasoned that the law \n\n \n \n \n11 \n\u201cwarrants lesser protection,\u201d id. at 232, because it \nregulated professional speech expressed while the \ncounselor provides \u201cpersonalized services to a client \nbased on the professional\u2019s expert knowledge.\u201d Id. at \n233 (concluding \u201cthat speech occurring as part of \nSOCE counseling is professional speech\u201d).  \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \nthe law \u201cdiscriminates on the basis of content,\u201d id. at \n236, it concluded that such discrimination was \u201cper-\nmissible\u201d because \u201c[t]he New Jersey legislature * * * \ntargeted SOCE counseling for prohibition because it \nwas presented with evidence that this particular \nform of counseling is ineffective and potentially \nharmful to clients, id. at 237. In other words, the \ncourt of appeals held that the state could discrimi-\nnate on the basis of content \u201cto protect its citizens \nfrom ineffective or harmful professional practices.\u201d \nId. The Third Circuit went on to uphold the law un-\nder intermediate scrutiny, finding that it \u201cdirectly \nadvances the government\u2019s interest in protecting cli-\nents from ineffective and/or harmful professional \nservices\u201d and is \u201csufficiently tailored\u201d to further that \nend. Id. at 237, 240.  \nAnother case that relied on the so-called \u201cprofes-\nsional speech\u201d doctrine was Moore-King v. County of \nChesterfield, 708 F.3d 560 (4th Cir. 2013). There, the \nFourth Circuit held that several county ordinances \nthat regulated fortune teller businesses did not vio-\nlate the First Amendment free expression rights of a \nself-described \u201cspiritual counselor.\u201d See 708 F.3d at \n569. The court of appeals held that \u201c[u]nder the pro-\nfessional speech doctrine, the government can li-\ncense and regulate those who would provide services \nto their clients for compensation without running \n\n \n \n \n12 \nafoul of the First Amendment.\u201d Id. The court of ap-\npeals concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cactivities fit \ncomfortably within the confines of professional \nspeech analysis\u201d because \u201cher psychic activities and \nspiritual counseling generally involve a personalized \nreading for a paying client.\u201d Id. \nThis Court identified by name and soundly and un-\nequivocally rejected the holdings of Pickup, King, \nand Moore-King in National Institute of Family & \nLife Advocates v. Becerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018) (\u201cNI-\nFLA\u201d). Observing that it \u201chas \u2018been reluctant to \nmark off new categories of speech for diminished \nconstitutional protection,\u2019\u201d id. at 767 (quoting Den-\nver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium, \nInc. v. F.C.C., 518 U.S. 727, 804 (1996) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring in part)), this Court noted that it \u201chas not \nrecognized \u2018professional speech\u2019 as a separate cate-\ngory of speech,\u201d id. \u201cAnd it has been especially reluc-\ntant to \u2018exemp[t] a category of speech from the nor-\nmal prohibition on content-based restrictions.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709, 722 \n(2012) (plurality opinion)). Under this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents, governments may not impose content-based \nrestrictions on speech without \u201cpersuasive evidence \nof a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition to \nthat effect.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). \nThis Court further observed that \u201c[t]he dangers as-\nsociated with content-based regulations of speech \nare also present in the context of professional \nspeech.\u201d NIFLA, 585 U.S. at 771. The Court cau-\ntioned that \u201cregulating the content of professionals\u2019 \nspeech \u2018pose[s] the inherent risk that the Govern-\nment seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory \ngoal, \nbut \nto \nsuppress \nunpopular \nideas \nor \n\n \n \n \n13 \ninformation.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. \nF.C.C., 512 U.S. 622, 641 (1994)). The Court consid-\nered the practice of medicine as an example in which \nspeech should be protected, observing that \u201c[d]octors \nhelp patients make deeply personal decisions, and \ntheir candor is crucial.\u201d Id. (quoting Wollschlaeger v. \nGovernor, Fla., 848 F.3d 1293, 1328 (11th Cir. 2017) \n(en banc) (Pryor, J., concurring)). \nThe Eleventh Circuit case that the Court cited, \nWollschlaeger, is illustrative. There, the court of ap-\npeals held that the record-keeping provision of Flor-\nida\u2019s Firearm Owners\u2019 Privacy Act, which prohibited \nphysicians from intentionally entering any disclosed \ninformation concerning firearm ownership into the \npatient\u2019s medical record under certain circum-\nstances, constituted a speaker-focused and content-\nbased restriction on speech, and thus was subject to \nFirst Amendment scrutiny. See 848 F.3d at 1307. \nThe court of appeals found that \u201c[t]he record-keeping \nand inquiry provisions expressly limit the ability of \ncertain speakers\u2014doctors and medical profession-\nals\u2014to write and speak about a certain topic\u2014the \nownership of firearms\u2014and thereby restrict their \nability to communicate and/or convey a message.\u201d Id. \nAs a result, the court of appeals concluded, \u201cthere \ncan be no doubt that these provisions trigger First \nAmendment scrutiny.\u201d Ibid. \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected the argument that \nthe First Amendment is not implicated because any \neffect on speech would be merely incidental to the \nregulation of professional conduct. 848 F.3d at 1308. \nThe court of appeals observed that \u201ccharacterizing \nspeech as conduct is a dubious constitutional enter-\nprise,\u201d id. at 1309, and noted that this Court has \n\n \n \n \n14 \nconsistently \u201capplied heightened scrutiny to regula-\ntions restricting the speech of professionals,\u201d id. at \n1310. \nDespite this Court\u2019s explicit rejection and abroga-\ntion of Pickup and King in NIFLA, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals continues to uphold content-based \nbans on counseling. In Tingley v. Ferguson, the \nNinth Circuit upheld Washington\u2019s law that subjects \nlicensed health care providers to discipline if they \npractice \u201cconversion therapy\u201d on minor patients, \nfinding that the law did not violate the First Amend-\nment. 47 F.4th 1055, 1084 (9th Cir. 2022), cert. de-\nnied, 144 S. Ct. 33 (2023). The court of appeals re-\njected the argument that NIFLA fully abrogated \nPickup, concluding that \u201c[it] abrogated only the \u2018pro-\nfessional speech\u2019 doctrine\u2014the part of Pickup in \nwhich we determined that speech within the con-\nfines of a professional relationship (the \u201cmidpoint\u201d of \nthe continuum) categorically receives lesser scru-\ntiny.\u201d Id. at 1073. In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, \u201cNI-\nFLA does not require us to abandon our analysis in \nPickup insofar as it related to conduct.\u201d Id. The court \nof appeals concluded that NIFLA does not prevent \n\u201cthe regulation of professional conduct, even if it \u201cin-\ncidentally burden[s] speech.\u201d Id. at 1075 (quoting \n585 U.S. at 769). For that reason, the court of ap-\npeals held that \u201c[b]ecause Pickup\u2019s holding rests \nupon that exception, it survives NIFLA.\u201d Id. The \nNinth Circuit then found that the law survived ra-\ntional basis review. See id. at 1078. \nMembers of this Court have acknowledged that \n\u201c[t]he Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion created a Circuit \nsplit.\u201d Tingley v. Ferguson, 144 S. Ct. 33, 34 (2023) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) \n\n \n \n \n15 \n(citing Otto, 981 F.3d at 859, 865); see also id. at 35 \n(Alito, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (not-\ning that \u201c[t]here is a conflict in the Circuits about the \nconstitutionality of [conversion therapy] laws\u201d). As \nJustice Thomas observed, \u201cthe Ninth Circuit at-\ntempted to sidestep\u201d this Court\u2019s precedents subject-\ning content-based laws to strict scrutiny \u201cby conclud-\ning that counseling is unprotected by the First \nAmendment because States have traditionally regu-\nlated the practice of medicine.\u201d Tingley, 144 S. Ct. at \n34\u201335. But \u201c[t]he Court has already made clear its \n\u2018reluctance to exempt a category of speech from the \nnormal prohibition on content-based restrictions.\u2019\u201d \nId. (quoting NIFLA, 585 U.S. at 767) (cleaned up). \nAnd \u201cthe Court has instructed that states may not \n\u2018impose content-based restrictions on speech without \n\u2018persuasive evidence * * * of a long (if heretofore un-\nrecognized) tradition\u2019 to that effect.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting NI-\nFLA, 585 U.S. at 767 (citation omitted)). Yet, as Jus-\ntice Thomas observed, \u201cthe Ninth Circuit did not of-\nfer a single example of a historical regulation analo-\ngous to [Washington\u2019s conversion-therapy law], \nwhich targets treatments conducted solely through \nspeech.\u201d Id. \nThe Tenth Circuit exacerbated the circuit split last \nmonth when it upheld Colorado\u2019s counseling ban. \nChiles v. Salazar, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 4157902 \n(10th Cir. Sept. 12, 2024). Following the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s interpretation of NIFLA, the court of appeals \nfound that Colorado\u2019s law fit within what it deemed \n\u201cthe second NIFLA context\u201d\u2014namely, that \u201cStates \nmay regulate professional conduct.\u201d 2024 WL \n4157902, at *11. The Tenth Circuit observed that \n\u201c[t]here is a long-established history of states \n\n \n \n \n16 \nregulating the healthcare professions,\u201d id., at *15, \nand it agreed with the district court that \u201ctalk ther-\napy provided by mental health professionals is a \nmedical treatment,\u201d id., and that the law \u201cinci-\ndentally involves speech because an aspect of the \ncounseling conduct, by its nature, necessarily in-\nvolves speech,\u201d id., at *18. The court of appeals then \nupheld the law under rational basis review, finding \nthat it was \u201crationally related to Colorado\u2019s interest \nin protecting minor patients seeking mental health \ncare from obtaining ineffective and harmful thera-\npeutic modalities.\u201d Id., at *28. \nThe sharp circuit split over the level of judicial re-\nview accorded to laws banning counseling demon-\nstrates the need for precision in the Court\u2019s decision \nin this case (and also future clarification from this \nCourt). In Pickup, the Ninth Circuit applied rational \nbasis scrutiny, deeming California\u2019s counseling ban \nas a mere regulation of \u201cprofessional conduct.\u201d 740 \nF.3d at 1229. In King, the Third Circuit took a dif-\nferent approach, subjecting a similar law to interme-\ndiate scrutiny on the grounds that the speech in-\nvolved in therapy, though not fully protected, war-\nrants heightened protection. See 767 F.3d at 237. \nBut this Court in NIFLA emphatically and unequiv-\nocally rejected the creation of a \u201cprofessional speech\u201d \ndoctrine, holding that content-based speech re-\nstrictions cannot be justified without a clear histori-\ncal basis. See 585 U.S. at 767. Despite NIFLA\u2019s clear \nabrogation of Pickup and King, lower courts con-\ntinue to defy this Court\u2019s unequivocal instructions. \nThe Ninth Circuit in Tingley, 47 F.4th at 1084, and \nthe Tenth Circuit in Chiles, 2024 WL 4157902, at \n*11, have improperly upheld \u201cconversion therapy\u201d \n\n \n \n \n17 \nbans by treating therapeutic speech as professional \nconduct and applying rational basis review. These \nrulings deepen a conflict that cuts to the heart of this \nCourt\u2019s First Amendment jurisprudence and disre-\ngards this Court\u2019s precedents that content-based \nspeech restrictions are always subject to strict scru-\ntiny. See Reed, 576 U.S. at 163. As Members of this \nCourt have acknowledged, this Court must eventu-\nally intervene to resolve the constitutional confusion \ncreated by the lower courts\u2019 ongoing misinterpreta-\ntion of NIFLA and affirm that content- and view-\npoint-based speech restrictions, even under the \nguise of regulating medical treatments, are subject \nto strict scrutiny. E.g., Tingley, 144 S. Ct. at 34 \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); id. \nat 35 (Alito, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nIn the meantime, this Court should carefully confine \nthe standard of review that it will announce in this \ncase to medical procedures and interventions that \ninvolve actual conduct, not pure speech. \nII. \nInvasive Medical Interventions Involving \nDrugs \nand \nSurgeries \nAre \nConduct, \nWhereas Counseling or Talk Therapy is \nSpeech \nProtected \nby \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nDangerous and scientifically contraindicated med-\nical procedures such as puberty blockers, cross-sex \nhormone treatment and experimental and invasive \nsurgeries are most often appropriately considered \nforms of conduct that fall within a state\u2019s traditional \nauthority to regulate public health and safety. By \ncontrast, talk therapy counseling that helps a client \nalign unwanted sexual attractions, behaviors, and \nidentities, or gender dysphoria with religious or \n\n \n \n \n18 \nmoral values is speech that lies at the heart of First \nAmendment protections. The Court should make a \nclear distinction when determining the appropriate \nlevel of judicial scrutiny in the context of laws that \nregulate invasive and experimental medical inter-\nventions involving dangerous drugs and life-altering \nsurgeries\u2014which is most often appropriately consid-\nered conduct\u2014from counseling or talk therapy\u2014\nwhich is speech. \nA. Invasive medical interventions involving \ndrugs and surgeries are conduct, not \nspeech.  \nDangerous and scientifically contraindicated med-\nical interventions such as puberty blockers, cross-\nsex hormone therapy and experimental surgeries, \nfundamentally differ from counseling or talk ther-\napy. Invasive medical interventions involving dan-\ngerous drugs and experimental surgeries are most \noften appropriately considered conduct. Cf. L. W. by \n& through Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 466 \n(6th Cir.), cert. granted sub nom. United States v. \nSkrmetti, 144 S. Ct. 2679 (2024) (noting that the \nmedical profession offered \u201ca variety of treatments,\u201d \nincluding \u201ccross-sex hormones and surgeries, for \u201cin-\ndividuals suffering from a lack of alignment between \ntheir biological sex and perceived gender\u201d (citing \nWalter O. Bockting & Eli Coleman, A Comprehen-\nsive Approach to the Treatment of Gender Dysphoria, \n5 J. Psych. & Hum. Sexuality 131, 132 (1992)). As \nsuch, medical procedures involving dangerous drugs \nand experimental surgeries are subject to regulation \nunder the state\u2019s traditional authority over health \nand safety. See Gonzales v. Carhart, supra, 550 U.S. \nat 157 (\u201cUnder our precedents it is clear the State \n\n \n \n \n19 \nhas a significant role to play in regulating the medi-\ncal profession.\u201d).  \nB. Drug and surgical interventions are \ninherently non-communicative and do not \nimplicate the First Amendment. \nInvasive medical interventions involving drugs \nand experimental surgeries are not protected speech \nor symbolic conduct. Such interventions do not \u201ccon-\nvey a particularized message.\u201d Spence v. State of \nWash., 418 U.S. 405, 411 (1974) (per curiam). Gen-\nder dysphoria is generally the result of underlying \nmental health conditions, adverse childhood experi-\nences or trauma, family difficulties, or significantly \nhigher rates of neurodevelopmental disorders such \nas autism spectrum disorder. See International \nFoundation for Therapeutic & Counselling Choice, \nIFTCC Principles for Approaches to Transgender \nTreatments (Mar. 9, 2023) (hereinafter \u201cPrinciples\u201d) \n(citing studies)3; see also Melanie Bechard et al., \nPsychosocial and Psychological Vulnerability in Ad-\nolescents with Gender Dysphoria: A \u201cProof of Princi-\nple\u201d Study, 43 J. Sex & Marital Therapy 678, 678\u2013\n88 (2017) (finding that \u201ca large percentage of adoles-\ncents referred for gender dysphoria have a substan-\ntial co-occurring history of psychosocial and psycho-\nlogical vulnerability\u201d). Unlike recognized forms of \nsymbolic speech, such as displaying a flag upside \ndown, see Spence, 418 U.S. at 406, or wearing an \narmband, see Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. \nSch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511 (1969), these medical \n \n3 Available at https://learning.iftcc.org/wp-content/up-\nloads/2023/12/IFTCC-Principles-for-Approaches-to-\nTransgender-Treatments.Final-01-12-23.pdf. \n\n \n \n \n20 \ninterventions do not convey a specific, particularized \nmessage to the public. Their primary purpose is \nmedical\u2014purportedly aimed at alleviating the dis-\ntress associated with gender dysphoria\u2014rather \nthan serving as an expression of personal or political \nbeliefs. Nor would the intended audience have a \ngreat likelihood of understanding the message given \nthe surrounding circumstances. See Spence, 418 \nU.S. at 411.  \nC. Counseling is First Amendment-protected \nspeech. \nUnlike medically invasive procedures, involving \ndangerous drugs and experimental surgeries, men-\ntal health counseling that helps clients align their \nfeelings, attractions, behaviors, or identity with reli-\ngious and moral values is First Amendment-pro-\ntected speech.  \nClinical and scientific evidence has consistently \ndemonstrated that exploring a client\u2019s unwanted \nsame-sex attractions, behaviors, and identity in a \nprofessional therapeutic setting through talk ther-\napy is safe and effective. See, e.g., Paul Santero et \nal., Effects of Therapy on Religious Men Who Have \nUnwanted Same-Sex Attraction, 85 Linacre Q. 1\u201317 \n(2018); Stanton L. Jones et al., A Longitudinal Study \nof Attempted Religiously Mediated Sexual Orienta-\ntion Change, J. Sex & Marital Therapy (2011); Elan \nKarten et al., Sexual Orientation Change Efforts in \nMen, J. Men\u2019s Studies 84\u2013102 (2010). \nClient-directed counseling is entirely speech \nbased. Clients seeking counseling typically hold tra-\nditional religious and moral values and seek to align \ntheir feelings, attractions, behaviors, and identity \n\n \n \n \n21 \nwith their beliefs. They seek counseling because \nthey want to live in accordance with their sincerely \nheld religious and moral beliefs. Thus, the clients\u2019 \nprimary goal in seeking counseling is often part of \ntheir broader desire to live consistent with their re-\nligious beliefs and moral values. See Christopher \nRosik, Motivational, Ethical and Epistemological \nFoundations In The Clinical Treatment Of Un-\nwanted Homoerotic Attraction, 29 J. Marital & Fam. \nTherapy 13 (2003). And, the fundamental principle \nof all mental health counseling\u2014that the client has \nthe right to self-determination\u2014demands that cli-\nents are entitled to make that decision. \nAs discussed above, the Eleventh Circuit found \nthat laws prohibiting therapists from counseling cli-\nents with unwanted sexual attractions and behav-\niors are unconstitutional content- and viewpoint-\nbased regulations of speech. See Otto v. City of Boca \nRaton, supra, 981 F.3d at 854. The court of appeals \nnoted that the First Amendment prohibits the gov-\nernment from regulating or punishing speech\u2014in-\ncluding speech by licensed professionals\u2014because of \nits message, ideas, or opinions. See id. at 862 (citing \nMosley, 408 U.S. at 95). The court of appeals thus \nfound that the ordinances were \u201cplainly speaker-fo-\ncused and content-based restrictions on speech: they \nlimit a category of people\u2014therapists\u2014from com-\nmunicating a particular message\u201d Id. at 863 (citation \nomitted). \u201cWhether therapy is prohibited depends \nonly on the content of the words used in that ther-\napy, and the ban on that content is because the gov-\nernment disagrees with it.\u201d Id.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding is correct because it \nis consistent with this Court\u2019s precedents. State and \n\n \n \n \n22 \nmunicipal laws that target counseling under the \nguise of banning one viewpoint are unconstitutional. \nSuch laws disfavor speech with a particular con-\ntent\u2014voluntary talk therapy about unwanted same-\nsex attraction and gender dysphoria. And they dis-\nfavor particular speakers\u2014licensed counselors and \ntherapists who help clients with unwanted sexual \nattractions and behaviors. Conversely, these laws do \nnot ban a counselor from encouraging a boy to \u201ctran-\nsition\u201d to a girl, as if such a denial of chromosomal \nreality is even possible. Nor do they prohibit a coun-\nselor from helping a girl embrace her same-sex at-\ntractions, behaviors, or identity. As such, counseling \nbans like the challenged ordinances in Otto \u201cgo[] \neven beyond mere content discrimination, to actual \nviewpoint discrimination.\u201d R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 \nU.S. 377, 391 (1992). Such bans are presumptively \nunconstitutional and therefore subject to strict scru-\ntiny. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the decision below. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nANITA L.

In the case of the word \u201cwoman,\u201d \nfor example, it\u2019s almost as if we are using homonyms, two \nwords with the same sound but different meanings, one for \nthe standard meaning and another for the proposed new \nmeaning. For example, petitioner is essentially contending \nthat there are two types of women: one type of woman who \nis female and another type of woman who is male. This is a \nneat little linguistic trick, but it is not grounded in reality.\nFurthermore, proponents of \u201cgender identity\u201d often \nsay that sex and gender are different (we agree); other \ntimes they say that sex and gender are the same (we \ndisagree). Proponents of \u201cgender identity\u201d can never \n\n5\nmake any of their arguments make sense. But for them, \nthe point is not to make sense; the point is to play with \nmaterial reality and language. The entire ideology of \n\u201cgender identity\u201d is in the realm of faith, ignorance, and \nproclamation, in full contempt of any collaborative social \nreality with shared meanings. Entangled in our individual \ninner worlds, all people are meant to see our thoughts as \nfacts, shadows of concrete reality.\nFor serious users of (and people who care about the \naccurate use of ) language, \u201cwoman\u201d is a time-stable \nnoun that references one of the most basic categorical \ndistinctions society must acknowledge: sex.

Reality and delusions cannot \nhold the same value or society descends into chaos.\u201d6\nWhen it comes to historical shifts in linguistic \nmeaning, some proposed changes are socially damaging. \nObserving that words can shift and change meaning over \ntime does not mean that all changes are rational or useful \nto all groups.

At issue in that case was an Idaho statute \nthat expressly granted men an advantage over women \nin the administration of probate estates. The Idaho law \nstated: \u201cOf several persons claiming and equally entitled \nto administer, males must be preferred to females, and \nrelatives of the whole to those of the half blood\u201d (emphasis \nadded).

She was, of course, talking \nabout sex, i.e., the difference between men and women, \nand the \u201cunalterable identifying trait\u201d to which she \nreferred was the fact of her client Sally Reed being female. \nIn contrast, the word \u201ctransgender\u201d is anything but an \n\n13\n\u201cunalterable identifying trait over which [an] individual \nhas no control.\u201d To equate it with the discrimination and \nother ill-treatment that women receive on account of \nbeing of the female sex would be a mistake of the highest \nproportions.

For example, \nwomen in our society are expected to wear high heels \nin order to comply with the rules of womanhood and to \nattract the attention of men, even though it has been \nshown time and again that wearing high heels impairs \nmobility and causes lower back pain, sore calves, foot \npain, ankle sprains, constricted blood vessels, crooked \nfeet, and weakened ligaments. Women are also expected \nto be sweet, docile, and subservient to men. This is all \nstill true, notwithstanding the gains that feminists have \nmade over the years.

For feminists, in other \nwords, gender is the problem, not the solution.\nThe fabricated concept of \u201cgender identity\u201d manipulates \nregressive, sexist stereotypes for a particularly harmful \npurpose\u2014to deny women the coherent, objective legal \ntaxonomy that anchors the jurisprudence of women\u2019s \nrights.34 On its face, \u201cgender identity\u201d refers to a person\u2019s \nsubjective identity, not to his or her sex, defined by \nwhatever feeling the person has of what it means to \u201cbe of \nWKH\u0003JHQGHU\u0003ZLWK\u0003ZKLFK\u0003KH\u0003RU\u0003VKH\u0003LGHQWL\u00c0HV\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003ZKDWHYHU\u0003\nexpression the person gives that feeling.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation\u2014the successful retrieval of the \"Brief for the Petitioner\"\u2014is a watershed moment in my belief formation. It completely resolves the primary \"known unknown\" that dominated my previous belief state. Where there was a void, there is now a detailed, robust, and well-supported legal argument from the United States. My model of the case has transformed from a one-sided account into a comprehensive view of the central legal clashes.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondent's Case (Stable):** My understanding of Tennessee's arguments remains unchanged, grounded in the amicus brief from allied states. This position rests on the following pillars:\n    *   **Standard of Review:** The law is a neutral regulation of medical procedures and should be subject to rational basis review.\n    *   **State's Interest:** The state has a legitimate interest in protecting minors from what it deems \"experimental\" and \"irreversible\" treatments, citing purported scientific uncertainty and shifts in European guidelines.\n    *   **Equal Protection:** The law does not discriminate based on sex because it applies its prohibitions equally to boys and girls seeking to transition.\n    *   **Judicial Deference:** The Court should defer to legislative judgment in an area of scientific controversy, especially on a preliminary record.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Case (New and Well-Defined):** The brief for the United States has filled the critical information gap, providing a comprehensive counter-narrative. The petitioner's argument is built on a direct assault on the premises of the respondent's case.\n    *   **Standard of Review (Heightened Scrutiny):** This is the central thrust of the US argument. The brief argues for heightened scrutiny on two independent grounds:\n        *   **Facial Sex Discrimination:** The law is not neutral; it explicitly classifies based on sex. The brief argues that the law's legality hinges on the patient's sex. For example, testosterone can be prescribed to a minor assigned male at birth (e.g., for delayed puberty) but is forbidden for a minor assigned female at birth (for gender-affirming care). This is a classic sex-based classification that, under precedents like ***United States v. Virginia (VMI)*** and ***Sessions v. Morales-Santana***, triggers heightened scrutiny.\n        *   **Discrimination Based on Transgender Status:** The brief also argues that the law discriminates against transgender individuals as a class, which should also warrant heightened scrutiny. It directly invokes ***Bostock v. Clayton County*** to argue that discrimination based on transgender status is inextricably linked to and constitutes a form of sex discrimination.\n    *   **Rebuttal of State's Interest and Medical Evidence:** The US directly confronts Tennessee's \"scientific uncertainty\" claim.\n        *   **Established Standard of Care:** The brief frames gender-affirming care not as \"experimental\" but as the established, evidence-based standard of care endorsed by every major American medical organization (American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, etc.), based on WPATH and Endocrine Society guidelines.\n        *   **Illegitimate State Interest:** The brief reframes Tennessee's stated interest in \"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\" (Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)) as an impermissible state goal. Citing cases like ***Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan***, the US argues this is an attempt to enforce sex-based stereotypes, which is not a legitimate, let alone \"exceedingly persuasive,\" justification for a law under the Equal Protection Clause.\n    *   **Failure of Tailoring (Underinclusivity and Overinclusivity):** This is a new and powerful line of argument that directly attacks the law's coherence.\n        *   **Severe Underinclusivity:** The law is not a general ban on certain medications for minors. It is \"severely underinclusive\" because it permits the *exact same treatments* (puberty blockers, hormones) for minors for a host of other reasons, such as precocious puberty or endometriosis. This undermines Tennessee's claim that its primary interest is protecting children from the inherent dangers of these specific drugs.\n        *   **Severe Overinclusivity:** The law is a \"categorical[] prohibit[ion]\" that makes no allowance for individualized medical judgment. It bans care even when a patient, their parents, and their doctors all agree it is medically necessary, effectively overriding the established standard of care in all circumstances for this specific group of patients.\n\nIn summary, the acquisition of the petitioner's brief has fundamentally changed my belief state. I now have a two-sided, high-fidelity model of the legal conflict. The core of the case will be the battle over the standard of review. If the Court accepts the US government's argument that the law is a facial sex-based classification (*VMI*, *Bostock*), it will apply heightened scrutiny, and the law will be very difficult for Tennessee to defend, especially given the arguments about underinclusivity and the consensus of US medical organizations. If the Court accepts Tennessee's argument that this is a neutral medical regulation, it will apply rational basis review, and the law will likely be upheld. My predictive confidence has increased significantly, as I now understand the precise legal questions and precedents upon which the case will turn.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, while failing to retrieve the oral argument transcript, has provided a trove of new information in the form of three amicus briefs supporting the respondent (Tennessee). This significantly deepens my understanding of the arguments against the petitioner's case, adding multiple layers of legal, philosophical, and strategic reasoning that were previously absent from my model. My beliefs are now more granular and textured, particularly concerning the respondent's side of the conflict.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Stable):** My understanding of the United States' arguments remains stable and well-defined, grounded in their official brief. This position rests on the demand for heightened scrutiny, based on two primary pillars:\n    *   **Facial Sex Discrimination:** The law is a sex-based classification because the legality of prescribing a specific treatment (e.g., testosterone) depends entirely on the patient's sex assigned at birth. This triggers heightened scrutiny under precedents like ***United States v. Virginia (VMI)***.\n    *   **Discrimination via Transgender Status:** The law discriminates against transgender individuals, a form of sex discrimination under the logic of ***Bostock v. Clayton County***.\n    *   **Failure of Justification:** Under heightened scrutiny, the state's justifications fail. The law is severely underinclusive (allowing the same drugs for other conditions) and overinclusive (a categorical ban ignoring individualized medical judgment), and it contradicts the consensus of major American medical organizations, which view this care as the established standard.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Dramatically Elaborated and More Aggressive):** My prior model of the respondent's case was a basic defense of the law as a neutral medical regulation deserving rational basis review. The new amicus briefs have replaced this simple model with a multi-pronged offensive.\n    *   **Direct Attack on Precedent (New Detail):** The respondent's allies are not merely arguing that ***Bostock*** is inapplicable; they are attacking its core reasoning. The Wisconsin Family Action brief argues that ***Bostock*** was \"based on a logical fallacy\" (circular reasoning, or \"begging the question\") by assuming the validity of a \"Transgender Vision\" of reality. The explicit call is to \"cabin, if not disclaim\" ***Bostock***'s reasoning and prevent its extension to the Equal Protection Clause.\n    *   **Deconstruction of the Proposed Class (New Detail):** A central new theme is that \"transgender\" is not a category deserving of special constitutional protection. The Women\u2019s Declaration International USA brief argues that the term has \"no coherent meaning,\" is \"not an immutable trait,\" and does not describe a \"politically powerless group.\" Therefore, it cannot be a quasi-suspect class. This line of argument seeks to preempt the entire heightened scrutiny analysis by invalidating the classification itself. The briefs characterize the underlying concepts as \"pseudo-science\" and a \"linguistic sleight of hand.\"\n    *   **Strategic Reframing of the Issue (New Detail):** The Liberty Counsel brief introduces a critical strategic distinction: the Tennessee law regulates *conduct* (the administration of drugs and surgeries), not *speech* or *status*. This framing is designed to place the law squarely within the state's traditional police power to regulate medical practices, which is typically subject to the highly deferential rational basis review, similar to the analysis in ***Gonzales v. Carhart***.\n    *   **Pitting Rights Against Each Other (New Detail):** The briefs from Wisconsin Family Action and WDI USA introduce the argument that granting protected status to \"gender identity\" would \"erode Equal Protection for sex, and particularly for women.\" This frames the case not as a simple question of expanding rights, but as a zero-sum conflict between the rights of transgender individuals and the existing sex-based rights of women, a potentially powerful argument.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved from a two-sided model of a legal debate into a model of a fundamental clash of worldviews. The petitioner's case is a classic Equal Protection argument based on established precedents. The respondent's case, as revealed by these amici, is a root-and-branch assault on the petitioner's entire framework: it attacks the key precedent (***Bostock***), the proposed class (\"transgender\"), the philosophical underpinnings (\"gender identity\"), and the very nature of the law itself (conduct, not status). The central conflict remains the standard of review, but I now understand that the path to rational basis review for the respondents is not just a simple argument for deference, but a complex, aggressive strategy to dismantle the petitioner's case piece by piece.",

The potential for a large update to my predictive model (\u03b8) is therefore extremely high, justifying the high Task EIG. For Design EIG, this action serves as a crucial test of a core strategic principle: after an initial overview, secure the primary briefs from both parties to establish the core argumentative structure before over-investing in secondary sources.

App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet.

See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn.

Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and, after \nexpedited briefing, reversed the preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 1a-101a; see id. at 102a-124a (stay opinion).6   \na. As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit rejected pri-\nvate plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim.  Pet. App. 30a-\n50a.  The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.  The plaintiffs in that case have also sought certiorari.  \nSee Doe 1 v. Kentucky, petition for cert. pending, No. 23-492 (filed \nNov. 3, 2023). \n\n14 \n \nrationally concluded that SB1 was an appropriate re-\nsponse to perceived risks and uncertainties associated \nwith puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  Pet. App. \n49a-50a.  The court acknowledged the countervailing ev-\nidence reflected in the district court\u2019s findings, which it \ndid not question.  Id. at 50a.  But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb. Judge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  Under SB1, \nJudge White emphasized, \u201cmedical procedures that are \npermitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.\u201d  Id. at 72a (citation omitted).  And \nJudge White explained that SB1 \u201ccondition[s] the avail-\nability of procedures on a minor\u2019s conformity with soci-\netal expectations associated with the minor\u2019s assigned \nsex\u201d by \u201cbar[ring] treatment when sought \u2018for the pur-\npose of\u200a\u2019 inducing physiological changes, like secondary \nsex characteristics, that are \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 how so-\nciety expects boys and girls to appear.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)).   \n \nJudge White concluded that SB1 cannot withstand \nheightened scrutiny because its \u201ctext[] effectively re-\nveal[s] that [its] purpose is to force boys and girls to \nlook and live like boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L. Stutzman, Long-term use of antidepressants, mood \nstabilizers, and antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a focus on \nappropriate deprescribing, 11 Mental Health Clinician 320, 329-330 \n(2021). \n12 See, e.g., Ankita Nanda et al., Adverse Effects of Stimulant In-\nterventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): \nA Comprehensive Systematic Review, 15 Cureus, no. 9, at 9 (Sept. \n2023); Natalia M.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was a meta-cognitive reflection on my current knowledge state, rather than new external evidence about the case. It contained no new facts, arguments, or signals regarding *United States v. Skrmetti*. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and unchanged from the previous update. The observation served to confirm the strategic necessity of acquiring the petitioner's primary brief to balance the detailed understanding I have of the respondent's arguments.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs about the case remain as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Stable but Relatively Undetailed):** My understanding of the United States' position is based on the initial case summary and confirmed by my internal reasoning. The core argument is that Tennessee's law warrants heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. This is based on two main theories:\n    *   **Facial Sex Discrimination:** The law is a sex-based classification because it prohibits certain medical treatments (e.g., testosterone) for one sex while allowing them for the other, directly implicating precedents like ***United States v. Virginia (VMI)***.\n    *   **Transgender Status as Sex Discrimination:** The law's targeting of transgender individuals constitutes a form of sex discrimination, following the logic established in the Title VII context by ***Bostock v. Clayton County***.\n    *   **Failure to Justify:** The petitioner will argue that under heightened scrutiny, the state's justifications are insufficient. The law is both underinclusive (permitting the same medications for other purposes) and overinclusive (imposing a categorical ban that overrides individualized medical judgment and the consensus of major medical associations).\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Elaborated and Aggressive):** My understanding of Tennessee's defense, significantly deepened by the amicus briefs from the prior observation, has moved beyond a simple call for rational basis review. It is now understood as a fundamental, multi-pronged assault on the petitioner's entire legal framework.\n    *   **Direct Attack on Precedent:** Allies of the respondent are not merely distinguishing ***Bostock*** but are actively attacking its core logic as a \"fallacy\" and urging the Court to \"cabin, if not disclaim\" its reasoning to prevent its application to the Equal Protection Clause.\n    *   **Deconstruction of the Protected Class:** A key strategy is to argue that \"transgender\" is not a coherent or immutable category deserving of heightened constitutional protection. Arguments characterize the concept as \"pseudo-science\" and a \"linguistic sleight of hand,\" aiming to dismantle the premise for heightened scrutiny before it can even be applied.\n    *   **Strategic Reframing of the Law:** The law is being framed as a regulation of *conduct* (medical procedures) rather than *status* (transgender identity). This is a crucial move to place the law under the state's traditional police power to regulate medicine, which would likely trigger the highly deferential rational basis review, similar to the analysis in abortion-related cases like ***Gonzales v. Carhart***.\n    *   **Pitting Rights Against Each Other:** A powerful narrative is being constructed that frames the case as a zero-sum conflict. Granting constitutional protection to \"gender identity\" is argued to \"erode Equal Protection for sex, and particularly for women,\" creating a conflict between the rights of women and the rights of transgender individuals.\n\nIn summary, my belief state is unchanged by this observation. I possess a detailed model of a clash between a traditional Equal Protection argument from the petitioner and a radical, deconstructive counter-argument from the respondent and their allies. The observation has confirmed my assessment that my knowledge is currently imbalanced, and that obtaining the petitioner's full arguments from their primary brief is the most critical next step to developing a robust predictive model of the Court's potential ruling.",

This information is maximally valuable for the task, as predicting the outcome depends entirely on how the Court resolves this direct clash of legal frameworks (Task EIG = 1.0). Additionally, observing how Tennessee chooses to litigate against a recent, adverse precedent (Bostock) in a high-profile case provides a valuable data point on modern constitutional litigation strategy before the Roberts Court.

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for mi\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for minors under 16.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.   \nIn recent years, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered gender transitioning in mi-\nnors reversed course.  Pet. App. 28a.  Health authori-\nties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the United \nKingdom have all concluded that these interventions \npose significant risks with unproven benefits:   \n\n8 \n \n\uf0b7 Sweden: Sweden\u2019s Board of Health and Wel-\nfare found that \u201cthe evidence on treatment effi-\ncacy and safety is still insufficient and inconclu-\nsive\u201d and that \u201cthe risks\u201d of puberty blockers \nand cross-sex hormones \u201ccurrently outweigh \nthe possible benefits.\u201d  J.A. 337-40, 715-29.   \n\uf0b7 Finland: Finland\u2019s Council for Choices in \nHealth Care found that \u201cgender reassignment \nof minors is an experimental practice\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he reliability of the existing studies\u201d is \n\u201chighly uncertain.\u201d  J.A. 583-84.  \n\uf0b7 Norway:  The Norwegian Healthcare Investi-\ngation Board concluded that the \u201cresearch-\nbased knowledge for gender-affirming treat-\nment (hormonal and surgical) ... is insufficient,\u201d \nespecially for \u201cthe teenage population.\u201d J.A. \n341-42.   \n\uf0b7 United Kingdom: The United Kingdom\u2019s \nlauded independent review found \u201cremarkably \nweak evidence\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions, emphasizing that the benefits of using \n\u201cpuberty blockers and masculinizing/feminizing \nhormones in adolescents are unproven.\u201d  Inde-\npendent Review of Gender Identity Services for \nChildren and Young People: Final Report 13, \n33, 194 (April 2024) (Cass Review); J.A. 333-35, \n364-68.    \nAcross these reviews, authorities confronted the \n\u201csuggest[ion] that hormone treatment reduces the ele-\nvated risk of death by suicide\u201d in transgender-identi-\n\n9 \n \nfying youth; as the Cass Review emphasized, \u201cthe evi-\ndence found did not support this conclusion.\u201d  Cass Re-\nview at 33; see also J.A. 660-75.  Based on the available \nevidence, these countries now consider medical gen-\nder-transition interventions experimental in minors \nand have effectively banned them outside of controlled \nresearch settings. J.A. 332-42, 409-11, 726-27. \nUndeterred, advocacy groups have doubled down \non aggressive interventions for minors.  WPATH\u2014the \n\u201cleading association,\u201d U.S. Br. 3\u2014crafted the most re-\ncent version of its guidelines \u201cto have serious effect in \nthe law and policy ... even if the wording isn\u2019t quite \ncorrect,\u201d Ex. 184 at 24, Boe v. Marshall, 2:22-cv-184 \n(M.D. Ala.), Doc. 560-34.  And indeed, \u201cideology, not \nscience\u201d drove WPATH\u2019s drafting process.  Eknes-\nTucker v. Governor of Alabama, 114 F.4th 1241, 1261 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (Lagoa, J., concurring in the denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nWPATH initially commissioned a Johns Hopkins-\nled review to provide evidence-based backing for the \nGuidelines.  But it \u201cabandoned\u201d that approach after \nthe review \u201cfound little to no evidence about children \nand adolescents\u201d benefitting from gender-transition \ninterventions.  Boe, Doc. 560-23 at 22-23; J.A. 375-76.  \nAs one contributor put it, \u201c[o]ur concerns, echoed by \nthe social justice lawyers we spoke with, is that evi-\ndence-based review reveals little or no evidence and \nputs us in an untenable position in terms of affecting \npolicy or winning lawsuits.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th \nat 1261 (Lagoa, J., concurring) (quoting Boe, Doc. 560-\n24 at 2).  Instead, the Guidelines purport to rely on a \n\u201cconsensus-based\u201d process that incorporates opinions \n\n10 \n \napproved by 75% of committee members.  WPATH-8 \nat S8, S247.  WPATH\u2019s \u201cconsensus\u201d process left the \ndoor open for prioritizing politics over science.  And \nthat is exactly what happened.   \nFederal officials intervened in the Guidelines\u2019 \ndrafting.  HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel \nLevine pressured WPATH to issue the Guidelines be-\ncause its \u201cfailure\u201d to do so was \u201cproving a barrier to \noptimal policy progress.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-34 at 54.  \nThen, after receiving a preview of the near-final \nGuidelines, Levine\u2019s staff asked WPATH to remove \nthe recommended age minimums because the \u201clistings \nof ages [would] result in devastating legislation for \ntrans care.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-36 at 28-29.  On a later \nZoom call, Levine conveyed that \u201cthe Biden admin-\nistration\u201d worried about the inclusion of age limits for \npolitical reasons and \u201casked [WPATH] to remove \nthem.\u201d  Id. at 11.  \nWPATH members questioned the \u201cethic[s]\u201d of \u201cal-\nlowing US politics to dictate\u201d the Guidelines.  Id. at 32.  \nThey \u201cexplained to\u201d Levine that WPATH \u201ccould not \njust remove\u201d all age minimums \u201cat this stage.\u201d  Id. at \n11.  After all, the \u201cexpert opinion\u201d that called for those \nlimits was the Guidelines\u2019 \u201conly evidence.\u201d  Id. at 57. \nBut the reality that the drafters\u2019 \u201cexpert opinion\u201d \n\u201cwould be influenced by politics\u201d soon set in.  Id. at 32-\n33.  The dam broke when the American Academy of \nPediatrics (AAP) indicated it would oppose the Guide-\nlines if any age minimums were included.  Boe, Doc. \n560-37 at 100-01.  One co-chair objected that accepting \nAAP\u2019s request would \u201cmake a joke of our methodol-\nogy.\u201d  Id. at 101.    \n\n11 \n \nWPATH caved anyway.  Within days of the Guide-\nlines\u2019 release, it abandoned all age minimums.  No-\nwhere do the Guidelines disclose WPATH\u2019s eleventh-\nhour departure from the \u201cconsensus-based\u201d process it \nnow touts.  WPATH-8 at S8.   \nC. Troubling Disclosures in Tennessee \nPrompt SB1. \nAround the same time, media reports disclosed \nthat Vanderbilt University Medical Center was \nproviding gender-transition procedures to minors.  \nJ.A. 161-64.  Some patients \u201cstarted gender-affirming \nhormones at 13 or 14.\u201d  Ex. 1-B, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video \nat 45:41-45:45).  Others received \u201ctop surgery\u201d\u2014i.e., \nmastectomies.  J.A. 181.  Recordings revealed one doc-\ntor stating that \u201ctop surgeries\u201d and \u201croutine hormone \ntreatment\u201d would \u201cmake a lot of money\u201d for the hospi-\ntal. Ex. 1-D, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:11-0:47). \nYet, by Vanderbilt physicians\u2019 own admissions, \nthey \u201cha[d] very, very little data to guide [the] treat-\nment\u201d and were \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Ex.1-G, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 37:29-37:32); J.A. 231.  Van-\nderbilt\u2019s gender-clinic director presented a seminar ti-\ntled \u201cCaring for the Transgender Patient: With little \nevidence, but a lot of love.\u201d  Ex. 1-H, D.Ct.Doc.113-1, \nPageID#1060.  She noted the absence of \u201creal consen-\nsus\u201d about appropriate cross-sex hormone levels.  J.A. \n231.  And she conceded that doctors \u201cha[d]n\u2019t been do-\ning this ... long enough to know the long-term effects\u201d \nof cross-sex hormones, \u201cparticularly ... in [the] pediat-\nric population.\u201d Ex.1-G, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at \n38:08-38:20).  Still, Vanderbilt broadly offered these \n\n12 \n \nprocedures to youth.  And it warned potential \u201cconsci-\nentious\u201d objectors, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t want to do this kind \nof \nwork, \ndon\u2019t \nwork \nat \nVanderbilt.\u201d \nEx.1-E, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:01-0:08, 1:10-1:14). \nFollowing these revelations and tracking Euro-\npean developments, a bipartisan coalition of Tennes-\nsee lawmakers passed SB1 to \u201cprotect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  \nThe legislature acknowledged gender dysphoria as a \ncondition involving \u201cdistress from a discordance be-\ntween\u201d a person\u2019s sex and asserted gender identity.  \nId. \u00a768-33-101(c).  But it detailed concerns with using \npharmaceutical and surgical interventions to address \nthis condition in minors. \nSpecifically, SB1\u2019s legislative findings recognized \nthat gender-transition interventions \u201ccan lead to [a] \nminor becoming irreversibly sterile, having increased \nrisk of disease and illness, or suffering adverse and \nsometimes fatal psychological consequences.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-\n33-101(b).  The law further observed that the harms \nassociated with these interventions \u201care [not] yet fully \nknown.\u201d  Id.  And it noted that \u201chealth authorities in \nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom \u2026 have \nfound no evidence that the benefits of these proce-\ndures outweigh the risks.\u201d Id. \u00a768-33-101(e).  At the \nsame time, the legislature found that \u201cminors lack the \nmaturity to fully understand and appreciate the life-\naltering consequences of such procedures.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n101(h).  SB1 drew attention to the \u201cmany individuals \n... express[ing] regret for medical procedures that were \nperformed ... on them ... when they were minors.\u201d  Id.  \nIndeed, the legislature heard from a detransitioner \n\n13 \n \nwho explained that she was not \u201ccapable of making in-\nformed lifelong decisions\u201d as a teenager, and yet doc-\ntors provided transition treatments that severely \ndamaged her body.  House Health Subcommittee (Jan. \n31, 2023), tinyurl.com/5n8ewdsv (59:15-1:02:22). \nSB1 regulates medical practice to address these \nconcerns.  It prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming certain \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, \nor live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the \nminor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or dis-\ntress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and \nasserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  \nRegulated procedures include \u201c[s]urgically removing, \nmodifying, altering, or entering into tissues, cavities, \nor organs\u201d and \u201c[p]rescribing, administering, or dis-\npensing any puberty blocker or hormone.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n102(5).  SB1 allows these procedures to treat different \nconditions, like congenital defects, precocious puberty, \ndisease, and physical injuries. Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  \nAnd it leaves other long-used treatments, such as psy-\nchotherapy, available to minors.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(c). \nD. The District Court Preliminarily Enjoins \nSB1, but the Sixth Circuit Reverses. \nThree minors, their parents, and a doctor brought \na pre-enforcement challenge to SB1, asserting sub-\nstantive-due-process and equal-protection theories.  \nThe federal government intervened.  Then, days be-\nfore SB1\u2019s effective date, the district court held the law \nfacially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined \nall but the surgical prohibition.  Pet. App. 130a-218a, \n\n14 \n \n219a-221a.  The Sixth Circuit stayed that injunction. \nPet. App. 102a-124a. \nThe Sixth Circuit then reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n101a.  On the equal-protection claim, Chief Judge Sut-\nton, joined by Judge Thapar, concluded that SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions do not \u201cturn[] on sex\u201d or impose a sex classi-\nfication.  Pet. App. 32a.  Rather, SB1\u2019s \u201cclassifications \nturn on presumptively valid age and medical condi-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.   And in imposing those re-\nstrictions, SB1 \u201ctreat[s] similarly situated individuals \nevenhandedly.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a.  Given SB1\u2019s presump-\ntively valid restrictions, the court held that the law \n\u201cdoes not trigger\u201d heightened review.  Pet. App. 33a.  \nApplying heightened scrutiny, the court recognized, \nwould transfer \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d and \u201cfraught \nline-drawing dilemmas\u201d from the \u201carena of public de-\nbate and legislative action\u201d to the unelected federal ju-\ndiciary.  Pet. App. 44a-45a.  That the government \u201cdis-\nagree[s] with the States\u2019 assessment of the risks and \nthe right response to those risks ... does not suffice to \ninvalidate a democratically enacted law.\u201d  Pet. App. \n50a.   \nJudge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  She \nconcluded that intermediate scrutiny applies and that \nSB1 fails that standard, largely based on her assess-\nment of the interventions\u2019 risks and efficacy.  Pet. App. \n59a, 85a-87a. \n \n \n\n15 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  Through SB1, Tennessee lawfully exercised its \npower to regulate medicine by protecting minors from \nrisky, unproven gender-transition interventions.  It is \nnot unconstitutional discrimination to say that drugs \ncan be prescribed for one reason but not another.  \nWeighing risks and benefits, States (and the federal \ngovernment) draw age- and use-based distinctions for \ndrugs all the time.   \nII. SB1 contains no sex classification that war-\nrants heightened review.  It creates two groups:  mi-\nnors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors \nseeking drugs for other medical purposes.  Each of \nthese groups \u201cincludes members of both sexes,\u201d so no \nfacial sex classification exists.  Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 \nU.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974).  Not every law that men-\ntions sex classifies based on sex.   \nThe government\u2019s newfound focus on \u201cgender con-\nformity\u201d flouts law and fact.  Repeatedly claiming that \nSB1 requires conformity does not create a sex-based \nline, and the Equal Protection Clause confers no sub-\nstantive right to non-conforming behavior.  SB1\u2019s risk-\nbenefit assessment of gender-transition interventions \ndoes not push conformity ends anyway.   \nHeightened review also does not apply because \nboys and girls are not similarly situated for purposes \nof SB1.  It defies biological reality to suggest, as the \ngovernment does, that males and females are medi-\ncally the same for purposes of receiving testosterone \nand estrogen. \n\n16 \n \nPivoting, the government seeks to overhaul this \nCourt\u2019s established equal-protection framework by \nconstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test.  Decades \nof precedent foreclose that maneuver.  Importing a \nbut-for approach to identify classifications under the \nConstitution would jettison longstanding limits on dis-\nparate-impact liability, drastically expand the appli-\ncation of heightened review, and clash with other legal \nprotections.  This Court should reject the govern-\nment\u2019s Bostock premise and the resulting doctrinal \nfallout.   \nA doctrinal sea change would be for naught be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  For \npuberty blockers, changing sex changes nothing since \nboth males and females take the same drug; medical \npurpose alone dictates the availability of the drug un-\nder SB1.  And for cross-sex hormones, the government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to reach a \ndifferent outcome.  \nIII. The challengers\u2019 transgender-discrimination \nargument does not justify heightened review.  SB1 \ndoes not classify based on transgender status.  And \neven if it did, this Court should not get back in the \nfraught \nbusiness \nof \ncreating \nsuspect \nclasses.  \nTransgender status does not uniquely warrant ex-\npanding the list of quasi-suspect classifications for the \nfirst time in nearly 50 years. \nIV.  Though rational-basis review applies, SB1 \nreadily satisfies intermediate scrutiny too.  The law \n\u201csubstantially relate[s]\u201d to Tennessee\u2019s undisputedly \n\n17 \n \ncompelling interests.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 68 \n(2001).  Even under heightened review, this Court de-\nfers to legislative factfinding and gives States \u201cwide \ndiscretion to pass legislation in areas where there is \nmedical and scientific uncertainty.\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.  That discretion makes this case easy: SB1 \ncontains specific findings and imposes restrictions in \nan area of medical uncertainty.   \nThe government convinced the district court to \nweigh the risks and benefits itself with no deference to \nlegislative findings.  That is not the proper legal stand-\nard or the judiciary\u2019s role.  Nor should this Court credit \nthe government\u2019s claim of \u201cmedical consensus\u201d given \nits credibility killing silence on the European health \nauthorities that SB1 itself references.  The govern-\nment\u2019s one-sided telling of the evidence misreports the \nmedical landscape.  And its over- and under-inclusiv-\nity arguments both ignore medical reality and fail to \nrebut SB1\u2019s substantial relation to Tennessee\u2019s com-\npelling interests. \nThe Court should affirm. \n \n \n\n18 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State \nfrom \u201cdeny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws.\u201d  That language \u201cwas \nnot designed to compel uniformity in the face of differ-\nence,\u201d Whitney v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, 309 U.S. 530, 542 \n(1940), or to \u201cforbid classifications\u201d entirely, Nord-\nlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992).  Rather, it \u201ckeeps \ngovernmental decisionmakers from treating differ-\nently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\u201d  \nId.  \nTo make out an equal-protection claim, a plaintiff \nmust first identify the classifications drawn by the \nchallenged action. A law contains a facial classifica-\ntion only when it \u201cdistinguish[es] between individu-\nals\u201d based on a particular characteristic.  Shaw v. \nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993).  For legislation \u201cneu-\ntral on its face,\u201d a plaintiff must show that a law dis-\nparately impacts a particular group and prove that the \nlegislature acted with \u201cdiscriminatory intent or pur-\npose.\u201d  Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. \nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977). \n\u201cWhen those who appear similarly situated are ... \ntreated differently,\u201d this Court looks to the govern-\nment\u2019s basis for the differential treatment.  Engquist \nv. Oregon Dep\u2019t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 602 (2008).  It \napplies strict scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na suspect class (race, alienage, or national origin) and \nintermediate scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na quasi-suspect class (sex or illegitimacy).  City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440-41 \n(1985).  Otherwise, \u201clegislation is presumed to be valid \n\n19 \n \nand will be sustained if the classification drawn by the \nstatute is rationally related to a legitimate state inter-\nest.\u201d  Id. at 440. \nThose principles compel upholding SB1.  The law \nregulates the practice of medicine by placing age- and \nuse-based restrictions on medical procedures.  It does \nnot classify based on any protected characteristic.  \nAnd SB1\u2019s approach satisfies intermediate scrutiny \nregardless. \nI. \nSB1 Sets Age- and Use-Based Limits on \nMedical Procedures  \nStates exercise broad power over \u201chealth and \nsafety matters.\u201d  Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated \nMed. Lab\u2019ys, 471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985).  This power in-\ncludes \u201cregulat[ing] the practice of medicine.\u201d  \nMcNaughton v. Johnson, 242 U.S. 344, 348-49 (1917).  \nIndeed, \u201c[t]here is perhaps no profession more \nproperly open to \u2026 regulation\u201d by States.  Watson v. \nMaryland, 218 U.S. 173, 176 (1910).     \nStates routinely exercise their public-health au-\nthority by regulating \u201cmedical treatments for adults \nand children.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  They prohibit or se-\nverely restrict irreversible practices like assisted sui-\ncide and euthanasia, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 719 (1997); Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 797 \n(1997), \u201cintrusive and possibly hazardous\u201d measures \nlike \u201cpsychosurgery and shock treatment,\u201d Aden v. \nYounger, 57 Cal. App. 3d 662, 668, 673 (1976), and the \ngood-faith \u201cadministration, sale, prescription, and use \nof dangerous ... drugs,\u201d Minnesota ex rel. Whipple v. \nMartinson, 256 U.S. 41, 45 (1921).  States\u2019 power over \n\n20 \n \npermissible medical practices is \u201cso manifest\u201d and \n\u201cfirmly established\u201d that it cannot \u201cbe successfully \ncalled in question.\u201d  Id. \nTennessee exercised this power when it passed \nSB1.  That law prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming specific \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either (1) \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify \nwith, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or (2) \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort \nor distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex \nand asserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n103(a)(1). And it allows these \u201cprocedures\u201d for other \nmedical uses.  Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).    \nSB1 expressly draws an age-based line between \nadults and minors.  That type of \u201cdistinguishing\u201d is \n\u201cnot unusual\u201d in medicine or the law generally.  Pet. \nApp. 31a; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a762-38-211(a) (tattoos); \nid. \u00a7\u00a736-3-105, -106 (marriage); W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a716-\n11-1 (sterilization).  And \u201cage is not a suspect classifi-\ncation.\u201d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470 (1991).   \nSB1 further distinguishes between the medical \npurpose for using certain \u201cmedical procedure[s].\u201d  It \nbars certain procedures\u2014surgery, puberty blockers, \nand cross-sex hormones\u2014\u201cfor the purpose of\u201d gender \ntransition.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  But it \nlets physicians use those surgeries and drugs to ad-\ndress distinct medical conditions\u2014e.g., precocious pu-\nberty, congenital defects, disease, and trauma.  Id. \n\u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  Put otherwise, SB1 separates the \nuse of certain surgeries and drugs to facilitate gender \ntransition from their use for different medical reasons.  \n\n21 \n \nEknes-Tucker v. Governor of Alabama, 80 F.4th 1205, \n1233 (11th Cir. 2023) (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nSound medical practice depends on such distinc-\ntions.  A procedure\u2019s risks cannot be isolated from its \nreason for use, since the medical purpose informs the \nrisk-reward calculus.  That is why FDA approves \ndrugs\u2014including those at issue here\u2014only for specific \nlabeled \u201cuse[s].\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7355(b)(1), (d); Benefit-Risk \nAssessment in Drug Regulatory Decision-Making, FDA \n(Mar. 30, 2018), https://tinyurl.com/4xzcw9br.  And it \nis why States frequently impose use-driven re-\nstrictions in medicine.  Doctors can use morphine to \ntreat a patient\u2019s pain but not to assist a patient\u2019s sui-\ncide.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-13-216; see Vacco, 521 U.S. \nat 808-09.  Doctors can perform pelvic surgery on \nwomen who have \u201cgiven birth\u201d but not on women being \nsubjected to ritualistic genital mutilation.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a739-13-110.  Doctors can perform an abortion to \naddress risks to a mother\u2019s life or health but not for \nelective purposes, in many States.  Id. \u00a739-15-213.  \nDoctors can prescribe testosterone to address hormo-\nnal imbalance but not to \u201cincrease muscle mass, \nstrength or weight without medical necessity.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a739-17-430(a)(2).  The list goes on.   \nA State may \u201creasonably\u201d deem a procedure \u201csafe \nwhen used for one purpose but risky when used for an-\nother, especially when\u201d the procedure \u201cis being put to \na relatively new use.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  Tennessee \ndid just that:  The legislature determined that the \ncost-benefit calculus warranted permitting the surger-\nies and drugs subject to SB1 for some reasons and not \n\n22 \n \nothers. That is not discrimination.  It is an even-\nhanded \u201cregulation of a medical procedure\u201d that turns \non the reason for the procedure\u2019s use.  Dobbs v. Jack-\nson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236 (2022); \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1227.   \nII. SB1 Contains No Sex Classification that \nWarrants Heightened Scrutiny \nA. SB1 does not classify based on sex. \nThe government cannot point to a sex classifica-\ntion under the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork.  And its \u201cgender conformity\u201d argument cannot \nsalvage that failure.  The Sixth Circuit correctly held \nthat SB1 turns on age and use\u2014not sex.   \n1. SB1 draws no sex-based line.  \nFacial sex classification occurs when a law \u201cdistin-\nguish[es] between individuals\u201d based on sex.  Shaw, \n509 U.S. at 642.  A university excludes \u201cwomen.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 520 (1996).  A \nState imposes different rules for \u201cmales\u201d versus \u201cfe-\nmales.\u201d  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192 (1976).  A \nlaw provides that \u201cmales must be preferred to females\u201d \nfor the handling of property.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. \n71, 73 (1971).  These are \u201cclassic sex classification[s].\u201d \nL.W. Br. 18.     \nTennessee\u2019s law draws no similar \u201csex-based \nline[].\u201d  U.S. Br. 19.   SB1 does not \u201cprefer one sex over \nthe other,\u201d \u201cinclude one sex and exclude the other,\u201d \n\u201cbestow benefits or burdens based on sex,\u201d or \u201capply \none rule for males and another for females.\u201d  Pet. App. \n\n23 \n \n32a.  It does not \u201cdraw any distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d based on sex.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 800.   \nThe government claims (at 21) that SB1 \u201cdefin[es] \nthe prohibited medical care based on the patient\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  The law references \u201csex,\u201d but it does not \u201cdiffer-\nentiate\u201d based on sex.  Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10.  And \nthat is what matters.  \nAssessing the lines drawn by SB1 reveals the ab-\nsence of any sex classification.  The law creates two \ngroups: (1) minors seeking to use puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for gender transition, and (2) mi-\nnors seeking to use puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for other medical purposes.  The first group \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014neither boys nor \ngirls can use these drugs for gender transition.  \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  The second group also \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014both boys and girls \ncan use these drugs for other medical purposes.  Id.  \nUnder Geduldig, this \u201clack of identity\u201d between sex \nand the \u201cgroups\u201d created by SB1\u2019s line drawing means \nthat no facial \u201csex\u201d classification exists.  Id. \nThe government\u2019s requested remedy is telling too.  \nThe government has not sought an injunction that \nwould \u201ctreat boys and girls the same\u201d; it wants an in-\njunction to \u201callow\u201d \u201cpuberty blockers and hormones\u201d to \nbe administered for additional purposes.  Eknes-\nTucker, 80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring); see \nPet. App. 37a-38a.  That request shows that \u201cthe clas-\nsification drawn by the statute\u201d concerns the drugs\u2019 \nprescribed use, not a patient\u2019s sex.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 440. \n\n24 \n \nThe government pivots (at 21) to SB1\u2019s mere \u201cref-\nerenc[e]\u201d to sex.  But not every law that mentions sex \nclassifies based on sex.  Pet. App. 36a.  Take this hy-\npothetical statute: \u201cNeither men nor women may drive \nan automobile without a license.\u201d  It uses \u201csex-based \nterms,\u201d U.S. Br. 2, 13, but draws no sex-based lines.  \nThe mere \u201cuse of gender specific\u201d versus \u201cneutral\u201d \nterms has never controlled the sex-classification in-\nquiry.  Cf. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 64.  Otherwise, myriad \nlaws without sex or race classifications would \u201crequire \nheightened review.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  This Court rejects \nthat approach.  See Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 232 n.14; Jam \nv. Int\u2019l Fin. Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 208 (2019) (42 U.S.C. \n\u00a71981, which mentions \u201cwhite\u201d citizens, treats all \nraces equally).  So while SB1 uses \u201cthe word \u2018sex,\u2019\u201d it \ndoes not include \u201ca sex classification\u201d within the \nmeaning of \u201cequal-protection caselaw.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nThat conclusion in no way threatens the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cindividual[s].\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 24.  Tennessee\u2019s point is not that laws like \nSB1 can classify by sex yet avoid sex-based scrutiny \nby harming boys and girls \u201cin equal degree.\u201d  L.W. Br. \n27-28; accord U.S. Br. 24.  The point is that SB1 con-\ntains no sex classification at all.  A law taxing all citi-\nzens burdens both men and women, but like SB1, it \ndoes not burden both men and women through a sex \nclassification.  The cases cited by the challengers (at \nU.S. Br. 24; L.W. Br. 27-28) drive home this distinc-\ntion:  Striking a juror because he\u2019s a man (J.E.B.) or \nbecause he\u2019s black (Powers) are actions that classify \nbased on sex or race.   No such sex classification exists \nin SB1; the law differentiates based on age and use.   \n\n25 \n \n2. The government\u2019s gender-conformity \nassertions show no sex classification. \nNor does SB1 classify based on sex by restricting \nminors from engaging in \u201cnon-conforming\u201d behavior.  \nU.S. Br. 22-23, 41; L.W. Br. 22-23, 28.   \nFor starters, not all restrictions on non-conform-\ning behavior involve a sex-based classification.  Con-\nsider a pair of contrasting examples: (1) a school dress \ncode that requires boys to wear pants and girls to wear \nskirts and (2) a school dress code that permits only \npants.  A boy wants to wear a skirt, asserting a non-\nconformity interest.  Under the first policy, a sex-\nbased line regulates the boy:  girls can wear skirts, and \nboys cannot.  Under the second policy, by contrast, no \nsex-based line exists:  no one can wear skirts.  In both \nexamples, the boy wants to engage in a \u201cnon-conform-\ning\u201d activity that is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with stereotypical \nattire.  And in both examples, the boy is prohibited \nfrom doing so.  Yet only the first policy draws a sex-\nbased line.  The second policy, like SB1, does not.   \nThe plaintiffs err (at 22, 28) by equating SB1 to \nlaws that expressly classify religions, races, or the \nsexes.  A law prohibiting \u201cpeople from working in pro-\nfessions \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 their sex\u201d creates sex-\nbased lines: for some jobs, a male can have the job and \na female cannot, and vice versa.  SB1 imposes no sim-\nilar classification. \nAnd no authority permits an equal-protection \nclaim for \u201cpeople who fail to conform\u201d absent any sex-\nbased classification.  L.W. Br. 21; see U.S. Br. 23.  In-\nstead, cases like Craig (different male-female alcohol \n\n26 \n \npurchasing rules), Virginia (different male-female ad-\nmissions rules), and Morales-Santana (different male-\nfemale immigration rules) all involved clear, facial sex \nclassifications.  Craig, 429 U.S. at 198-99; Virginia, \n518 U.S. at 532-33; Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. 47, 62-63 (2017).  Though they discussed stereo-\ntyping in applying intermediate scrutiny, they did not \nuse that concept to conjure a sex classification from a \nsex-neutral rule.   \nTo the extent the government now attempts to \nbackdoor in an Arlington Heights discriminatory-pur-\npose claim through \u201cconformity,\u201d U.S. Br. 22, that ar-\ngument likewise fails.  The government never mean-\ningfully pressed this argument below, and it points to \nno disparate impact on one sex.  More important, \nSB1\u2019s aim is not \u201c[e]nforcing conformity.\u201d  L.W. Br. 42.   \nTennessee enacted SB1 \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  In \ndetailed findings, SB1 catalogs Tennessee\u2019s interests \nin regulating early gender-transition interventions to \nprotect minors and the integrity of the medical profes-\nsion.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(b)-(m).  Along the way, SB1 men-\ntions encouraging minors \u201cto appreciate\u201d and not be \n\u201cdisdainful of their sex\u201d as they \u201cundergo puberty.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  But contra challengers\u2019 repeated \nassertions, that language is no smoking gun.  Cf. L.W. \nBr. 1, 23, 42, 52; U.S. Br. 2, 8, 16-18, 22, 27, 32-34, 49.  \nIt simply acknowledges the problems with using un-\nproven gender-transition interventions on minors.  \nGiven high desistance rates among youth and the \ntragic \u201cregret\u201d of detransitioners, it was not improper \nto conclude that kids benefit from additional time to \n\n27 \n \n\u201cappreciate their sex\u201d before embarking on body-alter-\ning paths.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  Nor \nis it improper for the State to protect minors from pro-\ncedures that \u201cencourage [them] to become disdainful of \ntheir sex\u201d\u2014and thus at risk for serious psychiatric \nconditions.  Id. (emphasis added).  Especially when re-\nsearch shows that gender-transition interventions can \nmake mental distress worse.  J.A. 400-01.  \nThe government may disagree with that research. \nBut it cannot cast SB1 as stereotype-driven by carica-\nturing legislative findings that detail a range of health \nconcerns.  Chanting a \u201cconformity\u201d mantra does not \novercome the heavy \u201cpresumption of legislative good \nfaith,\u201d Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 603 (2018), or \ndrown out the compelling concerns that drove SB1. \nAnd it is insincere because\u2014even if that language \nwere omitted\u2014the government would be here chal-\nlenging SB1\u2019s restrictions all the same. \n3. The Sixth Circuit properly applied \nthe sex-classification framework.  \nThe government\u2019s claim that Chief Judge Sutton \n\u201cfundamentally misunderstood\u201d equal-protection law \ndistorts the decision below.  U.S. Br. 16.  The Sixth \nCircuit did not spottily concede a sex classification \u201cat \ntimes.\u201d  U.S. Br. 18-19, 24-25.   It found \u201cno\u201d sex-based \nline in SB1, period.  Pet. App. 32a.  Having concluded \nthat SB1 lacks any sex classification, the court \nproperly declined to apply heightened review.  Pet. \nApp. 32a-33a.   \nThat decision in no way \u201cconflates the classifica-\ntions drawn by the law with the state\u2019s justification for \n\n28 \n \nit.\u201d  U.S. Br. 26.  The Sixth Circuit recognized that the \n\u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d or \u201crisk-reward assessment\u201d for \na procedure depends on the reason for the procedure\u2019s \nuse.  Pet. App. 34a, 37a.  It highlighted that fact to \nhelp explain that SB1 classifies by procedures\u2019 distinct \nmedical uses, not patients\u2019 sex.  Id. \nThe challengers attack the Sixth Circuit for stat-\ning that the \u201cnecessity of heightened review[] will not \nbe present every time that sex factors into a govern-\nment decision.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2 (quoting Pet. App. 39a); \nU.S. Br. 24-25.  But that\u2019s just a rejection of the gov-\nernment\u2019s attempted use of but-for causation to create \na novel class of Bostock-based equal-protection claims.  \nSee infra Part II.C.  As the Sixth Circuit recognized, \nDobbs and Geduldig reject heightened scrutiny for \nsex-adjacent restrictions that draw no sex-based lines.  \nPet. App. 39a; infra 33-34.  Whether those decisions \nare characterized as concluding that no sex classifica-\ntion exists, infra 32-35, or that heightened scrutiny \ndoes not apply to sex-adjacent claims, Pet. App. 39a, \nthe result is the same.  It is the government and plain-\ntiffs, not the Sixth Circuit, that \u201cbreak[] from a half \ncentury of this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2. \nB. Boys and girls are not similarly situated \nfor purposes of SB1.  \nThe challengers\u2019 arguments fail for the independ-\nent reason that boys and girls \u201care not similarly situ-\nated\u201d for purposes of SB1\u2019s restrictions.  Michael M. v. \nSuperior Court, 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (plurality). \nAs the Sixth Circuit correctly noted, the sexes\u2019 biolog-\nical differences provide yet another basis for declining \nheightened scrutiny.  Pet. App. 39a.   \n\n29 \n \nThis Court has never read the Equal Protection \nClause to \u201crequire things which are different in fact or \nopinion to be treated in law as though they were the \nsame.\u201d  Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940).  It \nhas instead analyzed a law\u2019s justifications only after \ndetermining that \u201cthose who appear similarly situated \nare \u2026 treated differently.\u201d  Engquist, 553 U.S. at 602.  \nScores of lower-court cases agree and treat this \u201csimi-\nlarly situated\u201d question as a threshold inquiry.1   \nUnder this approach, \u201cthe absence of similarly sit-\nuated individuals treated differently is \u2026 simply a \nway of saying that the plaintiff failed at the first step \nto prove intentional discrimination\u201d\u2014a step that must \nbe satisfied \u201c[b]efore a court may get to the business of \nassessing\u201d the law\u2019s justifications.  SECSYS v. Vigil, \n666 F.3d 678, 688-89 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.).   \nNguyen\u2019s mention of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d in apply-\ning scrutiny is not to the contrary.  Cf. L.W. Br. 35-36; \nU.S. Cert. Reply 5.  That discussion came only after \nconcluding that a law treated men and women differ-\nently \u201cunder like circumstances.\u201d  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at \n60.  And whether boys are similarly situated to girls \n \n1 See, e.g., People v. Whitfield, 888 N.E.2d 1166, 1172-73 (Ill. \n2007), as modified (Apr. 23, 2008); Timberland Partners XXI v. \nIowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 757 N.W.2d 172, 175 (Iowa 2008); In re \nWeisgerber, 169 P.3d 321, 328 (Kan. 2007); Benitez v. Rasmussen, \n626 N.W.2d 209, 219 (Neb. 2001); Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 \nF.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001); Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, \n1312-13 (10th Cir. 1998); Women Prisoners v. D.C., 93 F.3d 910, \n924 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Klinger v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 731 \n(8th Cir. 1994). \n\n30 \n \nfor purposes of SB1 matters at the outset, even if it \nalso matters when analyzing means-ends fit. \nThe challengers\u2019 reliance on \u201cBostock\u2019s framework \nfor identifying sex discrimination\u201d supports the simi-\nlarly situated inquiry\u2019s gatekeeping role.  L.W. Br. 18; \nU.S. Br. 27.  Bostock stated that discrimination re-\nquires showing that the plaintiff was treated \u201cworse \nthan others who are similarly situated.\u201d  590 U.S. at \n657.  It just deemed that prerequisite met since \u201cho-\nmosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to \nemployment decisions.\u201d  Id. at 660.  If this Court con-\nstitutionalizes Bostock\u2019s but-for standard (it should \nnot, see infra Part II.C), then Bostock\u2019s similarly situ-\nated requirement must travel alongside. \nThe government previously proposed shoehorning \nthe similarly situated requirement into the applica-\ntion of intermediate scrutiny.  U.S. Cert. Reply 5.  But \nit never explains how the similarly situated inquiry \nfits into that analysis or why boys and girls are similar \nfor purposes of receiving cross-sex hormones.  Instead, \nit generally contests the evidentiary basis for restrict-\ning gender-transition procedures for minors. U.S. Br.  \n39-50.  That analysis ducks the similarly situated in-\nquiry altogether.   \nHere, there is no question that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 \u201cen-\nduring\u201d \u201c[p]hysical differences\u201d keep them from being \nsimilarly situated with respect to SB1\u2019s restriction on \ncross-sex hormones.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  \nProviding testosterone to a boy with delayed puberty \naddresses a distinct medical condition, whereas \nproviding it to a girl causes a physical condition (se-\nvere hyperandrogenism).  Supra 6; J.A. 500-01, 521-\n\n31 \n \n22, 769-79.  Similarly, providing estrogen to a girl with \npremature ovarian insufficiency addresses a distinct \nmedical condition, whereas providing it to a boy causes \na physical condition (hyperestrogenemia).  Supra 6; \nJ.A. 779-81; ES Guidelines at 3886. \nThe government\u2019s sex-discrimination argument \nwould compel this Court to accept that males and fe-\nmales are medically the same for SB1\u2019s purposes\u2014and \nthat providing testosterone to a female to transition is \nthe \u201csame treatment\u201d as providing it to a male with a \nphysical malady.  U.S. Br. 2, 15, 18, 28.  No equal-pro-\ntection test requires this anti-science mendacity. \nC. Bostock does not render SB1 sex based. \nFailing the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork, the government asks this Court to create a new \ncategory of sex classifications based on Bostock\u2019s but-\nfor logic.  U.S. Br. 21-23.  The briefing pitches this step \nas \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cobvious[].\u201d  L.W. Br. 16; U.S. Br. 21.  \nBut \u201cthis wolf comes as a wolf.\u201d  Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Using \nbut-for-sex reasoning to trigger heightened scrutiny \nwould make a hash of this Court\u2019s equal-protection ju-\nrisprudence.  It would conflict with Bostock\u2019s reason-\ning.  And it would drastically expand heightened re-\nview.  This Court should reject the government\u2019s mis-\nuse of Bostock.  But even under the but-for test, the \ngovernment loses.   \n\n32 \n \n1. This Court has never taken a but-for \napproach to equal-protection \nclassifications.  \nConstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for rule would \nabrogate decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.   \nCurrently, a challenger has two paths to height-\nened equal-protection review: a facial classification or \na disparate impact plus discriminatory purpose.  SB1 \ndoes not facially classify by sex.  Supra Part II.A.  So \nthat leaves only the \u201csensitive inquiry\u201d into whether \nfacially neutral laws were in fact driven by \u201cdiscrimi-\nnatory intent or purpose.\u201d  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \nat 265-66.  To make that showing, the asserted \u201cdis-\ncriminatory intent or purpose\u201d must target the suspect \ncharacteristic at issue\u2014not some other characteristic.  \nId. at 265; see Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health \nClinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) (sex-based claim \u201cde-\nmand[s] ... at least a purpose that focuses upon women \nby reason of their sex\u201d).   \nThe government invents a third path.  It claims \nthat heightened review applies when some non-sex-\nbased classification incorporates sex as a but-for mat-\nter.  That argument contradicts scores of cases.   \nMost obviously, but-for causation conflicts with \nthis Court\u2019s sexual-orientation cases.  For decades, \nthis Court has faced claims of sexual-orientation dis-\ncrimination under equal-protection theories\u2014includ-\ning Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996); United States \nv. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013); and Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 651 (2015).  \u201cBut in those cases, \nthe Court never suggested that sexual orientation dis-\n\n33 \n \ncrimination is just a form of sex discrimination.\u201d  Bos-\ntock, 590 U.S. at 797 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  It \nis \u201cimplausible\u201d to suggest that \u201cin all of those sexual \norientation cases\u201d the Court \u201coverlook[ed] the fact that \nsexual orientation discrimination is actually a form of \nsex discrimination\u201d under the Constitution.  Id. at 798.   \nPregnancy and abortion cases also belie a but-for \napproach.  In Geduldig, this Court assessed whether \nexcluding conditions arising from pregnancy from dis-\nability benefits coverage denied women equal protec-\ntion.  417 U.S. at 489.  It said no, even though sex is a \nbut-for cause of pregnancy and despite the dissent\u2019s \ncounter that \u201c[i]n effect, one set of rules is applied to \nfemales and another to males.\u201d  Id. at 501 (Brennan, \nJ., dissenting).  The Court kept its focus on the \u201clegis-\nlative classification\u201d and the groups that classification \ncreated.  Id. at 496 n.20.  It emphasized that a preg-\nnancy-related restriction \u201cis a far cry from cases like \nReed \u2026 and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 \n(1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as \nsuch.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nBray reiterated that reasoning when rejecting an \nargument that anti-abortion demonstrations consti-\ntuted \u201cipso facto\u201d discrimination \u201cagainst women as a \nclass.\u201d  506 U.S. at 271.  Bray reached that result over \na dissent that contended that \u201c[a] classification based \non pregnancy is a sex-based classification\u201d because \n\u201cthe capacity to become pregnant is a characteristic \nnecessarily associated with one\u201d sex.  Id. at 323 n.20, \n327 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This Court has declined \nto \u201crevisit\u201d this line of precedent.  Coleman v. Ct. of \n\n34 \n \nAppeals, 566 U.S. 30, 54 (2012) (Ginsburg, J., dissent-\ning).  It remains good law.  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236.    \nMore generally, a but-for approach is incompatible \nwith the conceptual underpinning of equal-protection \njurisprudence.  Heightened review rests on the idea \nthat \u201ccertain classifications \u2026 supply a reason to infer \nantipathy\u201d on the part of lawmakers.  Pers. Adm\u2019r of \nMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979).  The Court \nreplaces the presumption of legislative validity with \nheightened review only after a robust showing tied to \na particular characteristic.   Infra 44-45.  But in the \ngovernment\u2019s \nview, \nnon-suspect \nclasses \n(here, \ntransgender-identifying persons) could receive height-\nened protection by leveraging a different suspect char-\nacteristic (here, sex).  That approach transforms the \nobject of heightened protection and, in doing so, di-\nvorces heightened scrutiny from its justification. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 but-for argument finds no support in \ncases applying heightened scrutiny when sex is one \namong several classifications.  L.W. Br. 30.  Courts \nsometimes face laws that classify based on sex and \nsomething else.  For example, in Craig, a state law \nprohibited the sale of beer to males under 21 and fe-\nmales under 18, drawing lines based on sex and age.  \n429 U.S. at 192.  Packaging sex classifications with \nother considerations does not somehow immunize the \nsex classification from scrutiny.  But there must be a \nclassification based on sex itself to trigger heightened \nreview.  None of plaintiffs\u2019 cited cases (at 30) support \nusing but-for reasoning to transform a non-sex-based \nclassification into a sex classification.  This Court\u2019s \n\n35 \n \ntask is \u201conly to measure the basic validity of the legis-\nlative classification\u201d drawn.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272.   \n2. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications defies \nBostock\u2019s reasoning. \nBostock disavowed any extension of its Title VII \nreasoning to other laws, like the Equal Protection \nClause.  For good reason.  \u201cThe Constitution is not a \nstatute,\u201d R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S. 330, \n346-47 (1935), and this Court has \u201cnever held that the \nconstitutional standard for adjudicating claims of in-\nvidious ... discrimination is identical to the standards \napplicable under Title VII,\u201d Washington v. Davis, 426 \nU.S. 229, 239 (1976).  And Bostock\u2019s reasoning refutes \nthe government\u2019s attempt to transplant Title VII\u2019s \nbut-for test. \nFirst, Bostock\u2019s analysis was driven by Title VII\u2019s \n\u201cstarkly broad\u201d text.  590 U.S. at 680.  That text makes \nit \u201cunlawful \u2026 for an employer\u201d to take certain em-\nployment actions \u201cbecause of ... race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e-2(a)(1).  \nWith that wording, it is \u201calways unlawful\u201d (absent an \nenumerated defense) to take covered actions \u201cbecause \nof\u201d sex.   Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Presi-\ndent & Fellows of Harvard Coll. (SFFA), 600 U.S. 181, \n309 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  And Bostock \nread Title VII\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u201d language to require a \u201cfo-\ncus[] on but-for discrimination.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  But \nthe Equal Protection Clause \u201ccontains none of the text \nthat the Court interpreted in Bostock.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1229.  Instead, in language adopted almost \na century earlier, the Equal Protection Clause directs \n\n36 \n \na \u201cfocus[] on the denial of equal protection.\u201d  Pet. App. \n40a.  Unlike Title VII, that constitutional requirement \n\u201caddresses all manner of distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d and has been read to \u201cimpl[y] different degrees \nof judicial scrutiny for different kinds of classifica-\ntions.\u201d  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 308 (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring).  \u201cThat such differently worded provisions should \nmean the same thing is implausible on its face.\u201d  Id.; \nsee Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP, 144 S.Ct. \n1221, 1260 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring).    \nSecond, structural considerations cut differently.  \nTitle VII incorporates a \u201csweeping\u201d but-for standard \nyet cabins liability to certain employment actions and \nemployers.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656-57.  As Bostock \nnoted, Title VII\u2019s non-discrimination rule also inter-\nacts with the statute\u2019s defenses and protections ap-\npearing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Id. \nat 681-82; Pet. App. 41a.  Those statutory features \ncheck the extension of broad but-for-based liability be-\nyond Title VII\u2019s limited coverage.  By contrast, the \nEqual Protection Clause governs all governmental ac-\ntion and lacks the deliberate checks that Bostock \nstressed.  Subjecting all governmental action to but-\nfor liability would collide with religious liberties and \nother constitutional rights in a manner Bostock no-\nwhere endorsed.   \nThird, Bostock\u2019s but-for standard fits with this \nCourt\u2019s \u201cthree ... leading precedents\u201d on Title VII.  590 \nU.S. at 663.  But as discussed, this Court\u2019s equal-pro-\ntection precedents cut the opposite way.  Supra 32-35.   \nFourth, congressional revisions to Title VII drive \nhome key distinctions between Title VII and the Equal \n\n37 \n \nProtection Clause.  Originally, this Court applied \nGeduldig\u2019s classification test to reject the argument \nthat Title VII\u2019s reference to \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d covers \npregnancy discrimination.  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, \n429 U.S. 125, 133-36 (1976).  Congress responded by \nspecifying that \u201cbecause of sex\u201d includes discrimina-\ntion \u201con the basis of pregnancy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e(k)\u2014\nconfirming that Title VII\u2019s causal inquiry sweeps be-\nyond the classification-focused Equal Protection \nClause.   \n3. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications would \nsubvert sex-based review.   \nConstitutionalizing a but-for approach would re-\nmove important guardrails on heightened review. \nAdopting the government\u2019s logic would open the \ndoor to disparate-impact liability under the Constitu-\ntion.  Laws relating to sex-specific medical proce-\ndures\u2014whether prostate cancer treatments, circumci-\nsions, erectile-dysfunction medications, or breast-\nfeeding therapies\u2014may have to \u201crun[] the gauntlet of \nskeptical judicial review\u201d under the theory that sex is \na but-for cause.  Pet. App. 35a-36a.  The same would \ngo for pregnancy-related restrictions, contra Geduldig, \nand for abortion regulations, contra Dobbs.   \nThe heightened-scrutiny fallout would spiral be-\nyond sex.  Are government employers\u2019 no-visa-spon-\nsorship policies unconstitutional because national \norigin is a but-for cause of needing a visa?  Is race a \nbut-for cause when a university credits an applicant\u2019s \nessay about how racial discrimination \u201caffected his or \n\n38 \n \nher life\u201d?  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230.  Is racial lineage a \nbut-for cause of any law regulating tribal members?  \nSee 25 U.S.C. \u00a71915(a); 1 Navajo Nation Code \u00a7701.  \nAccepting the government\u2019s theory would leave courts \npuzzling through these and whatever other but-for co-\nnundrums creative lawyers concoct. \nA but-for approach would also allow new classes to \nwield heightened scrutiny in a way that harms \nwomen.  Women\u2019s heightened legal protections reflect \ntheir history of being targeted with \u201cpervasive\u201d dis-\ncrimination and disadvantage.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n273.  But if the government\u2019s theory holds, men who \nidentify as women could claim constitutionally based \naccess to women\u2019s bathrooms,2 women\u2019s locker rooms,3 \nand women\u2019s sports.4  Accepting that theory would \nperversely erode women\u2019s rights and jeopardize land-\nmark statutes protecting women\u2019s equal access to \nschools, winners\u2019 podiums, and beyond.    \nOn top of all that, the but-for causation test would \nset the Equal Protection Clause on a collision course \nwith the Free Exercise Clause.  Conflicting rights will \narise for doctors at State-run hospitals with conscien-\ntious objections, students whose religious convictions \nprevent the sharing of intimate spaces with the oppo-\nsite sex, and so on.  Unlike Congress in the statutory \n \n2 U.S. Br., Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. John\u2019s Cnty., No. 18-13592, \n(11th Cir.), Doc. 254. \n3 U.S. Statement, Roe v. Critchfield, No. 1:23-cv-00315-DCN (D. \nIdaho), Doc. 41. \n4 U.S. Br., B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078 (4th \nCir.), Doc. 68. \n\n39 \n \ncontext, this Court could not carve the government\u2019s \nproposed but-for-sex mandates out of the Constitution \nto protect \u201csincere[]\u201d religious views.  Religious Sisters \nof Mercy v. Becerra, 55 F.4th 583, 598 (8th Cir. 2022).  \nNor would \u201cfederal conscience laws\u201d be an out, since \nthe Constitution would trump.  FDA v. All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 387 (2024).  The impossible \ntask of measuring the relative import of conflicting re-\nligion and equal-protection claims is yet another prob-\nlem attending the government\u2019s but-for test.   \n4. Regardless, sex is not a but-for cause \nin SB1.  \nThis Court should reject the but-for test outright. \nBut the government loses even under its own test be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  \nChanging a person\u2019s \u201csex\u201d does not change the availa-\nbility of the drugs regulated by SB1.    \nPuberty Blockers:  The government\u2019s argument \nbarely mentions puberty blockers.  Fitting, because \n\u201cpuberty blockers involve the same drug used equally \nby gender-transitioning boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 38a \n(emphasis added).  If a boy seeks puberty blockers to \ntransition, he cannot have them.  If a girl seeks pu-\nberty blockers to transition, she cannot have them.  So \n\u201cholding other things constant but changing the mi-\nnor\u2019s sex\u201d does not, in fact, \u201cyield a different outcome.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  Sex does not dictate SB1\u2019s \nlimits on puberty blockers, even as a but-for matter.   \n\n40 \n \nCross-Sex Hormones:  The same goes for cross-sex \nhormones.  No boy can receive hormones to transition; \nlikewise, no girl can receive hormones to transition. \nBut either can receive hormones to treat physical ab-\nnormalities. Medical purpose, not sex, dictates availa-\nbility under SB1.  Cf. Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, \n181-82 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., dissenting) \n(finding no sex-discrimination while applying Bos-\ntock\u2019s but-for test).    \nThe government\u2019s counter changes both sex and \nmedical purpose.  It claims (at 21-22) that a female \n\u201ccannot receive \u2026 testosterone to live and present as \na male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.\u201d  \nBut the provision of testosterone to boys \u201cto treat a mi-\nnor\u2019s congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or \nphysical injury,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A), \ndoes not serve the same medical purpose as the provi-\nsion of testosterone to a girl who wants to transition.  \nThe same drug is at issue.  But it is used at different \ndosages and for different medical purposes.  See J.A. \n769-70.  Just like administering morphine to \u201cease [a] \npatient\u2019s pain\u201d is not the same as using morphine to \nassist a patient\u2019s suicide.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 802.  The \ngovernment\u2019s argument conflates \u201cdistinct uses of tes-\ntosterone and estrogen.\u201d  Pet. App. 34a.   \nSeparately, biological realities mean that only \nboys use estrogen for the purpose of transitioning to \nan \u201cidentity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1)(A).  So too with girls and \ntestosterone.  But laws regulating treatments \u201c\u2018that \nonly one sex can undergo\u2019 ordinarily do not \u2018trigger \n\n41 \n \nheightened constitutional scrutiny.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 33a \n(quoting Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236); supra 32-35.   \nThe upshot: \u201c[H]olding other things constant but \nchanging the minor\u2019s sex\u201d does not change the outcome \nunder SB1.  U.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  The government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to show \nany differential outcome.  It fails its own but-for-sex \ntest. \nIII. SB1 Contains No Transgender Classification \nthat Warrants Heightened Scrutiny \nThe government\u2019s transgender-discrimination ar-\ngument likewise gets it nowhere.  SB1 contains no \ntransgender-based classification.  And heightened \nscrutiny would not apply in any event. \nA. SB1 does not classify based on \ntransgender status. \nThe government assumes (at 16, 28-29) that SB1 \ncontains facial transgender classifications, even in the \nface of a circuit split on the issue.  But SB1 regulates \nbased on medical use, not transgender status.  \nTransgender-identifying minors are in both \u201cgroups\u201d \ncreated by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  A \ntransgender-identifying minor can receive puberty \nblockers for some purposes (e.g., to treat precocious \npuberty); a transgender-identifying minor cannot re-\nceive puberty blockers for other purposes (e.g., to tran-\nsition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  The same \ngoes for cross-sex hormones.  Transgender-identifying \npersons fall on both sides of the line.  There is thus a \n\u201clack of identity\u201d between transgender status and the \n\n42 \n \ngroups created by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 \nn.20. \nAny disparate impact on transgender-identifying \npersons does not create a classification under the \nEqual Protection Clause.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-78.  \nAgain, heightened scrutiny does not apply to \u201c[t]he \nregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex \ncan undergo\u201d unless \u201cthe regulation is a \u2018mere pretext \ndesigned to effect an invidious discrimination.\u2019\u201d \nDobbs, 597 U.S. at 236 (cleaned up) (quoting Geduldig, \n417 U.S. at 496 n.20); see Bray, 506 U.S. at 271 (simi-\nlar).  So too with a transgender-discrimination claim:  \nThe government must show that SB1 is a \u201cpretext for \ninvidious discrimination\u201d against transgender-identi-\nfying individuals.  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th 1229-30; see \nKadel, 100 F.4th at 174 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  \nThe government has not \u201cmade the case that ani-\nmus toward transgender individuals as a class drives \nthis law.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a-47a.  Again, the parties did \nnot meaningfully press this argument below.  And this \nCourt \u201chas long disfavored arguments based on al-\nleged legislative motives.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 253.  Ju-\ndicial attempts to ascertain these \u201cmotivation[s]\u201d nec-\nessarily \u201crepresent a substantial intrusion into the \nworkings of other branches of government.\u201d  Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 268 n.18.  Courts are even more \n\u201creluctan[t] to attribute unconstitutional motives to \nthe states,\u201d Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394 (1983), \ngiven the federalism stakes.  Here, the government \nflippantly suggests that Tennessee, 23 \u201cother States,\u201d \nand apparently much of Europe have followed \u201cfar-\n\n43 \n \nright interest groups\u201d to \u201ctarget[] transgender individ-\nuals.\u201d  U.S. Br. 7 n.3, 8; see L.W. Br. 53.  But charges \nof discriminatory purpose demand more than tired \ntalking points.   \nNor could the government clear the Arlington \nHeights bar if it tried.  SB1 arose from a publicized \ncontroversy about ill-supported medical practices at a \nmajor Tennessee hospital.  It contains substantial fac-\ntual findings exhibiting the legislature\u2019s sincere con-\ncern with protecting kids.  And it leaves open gender-\ntransition interventions for transgender-identifying \nadults.  Although the government tries (at 8) to situate \nSB1 in a \u201cseries\u201d of Tennessee laws \u201ctargeting\u201d \ntransgender-identifying people, that narrative ignores \nthat many such measures countered federal efforts to \nimpose unprecedented gender-identity mandates gov-\nerning pronouns, bathroom and sports access, and \nmore.  See, e.g., Tennessee v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 104 F.4th \n577, 586 (6th Cir. 2024).  None of the government\u2019s \nsideswipes surmount the heavy \u201cpresumption of legis-\nlative good faith.\u201d  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 603. \nThat leaves the argument that the Court should \npresume animus under a \u201cproxy\u201d-discrimination the-\nory.  But winning that argument requires showing \nthat \u201cno rational, nondiscriminatory explanation ex-\nists for the law\u2019s classification.\u201d Kadel, 100 F.4th at \n170 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  The restricted activ-\nity must be \u201csuch an irrational object of disfavor that \n\u2026 an intent to disfavor [a] class can readily be pre-\nsumed\u201d\u2014in the same way a \u201ctax on wearing yarmul-\nkes\u201d would be considered a \u201ctax on Jews.\u201d  Bray, 506 \n\n44 \n \nU.S. at 270.  Regulating yarmulkes is an \u201cirrational \nsurrogate.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nHere, though, rational explanations beyond bare \n\u201chostility\u201d abound.  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, \n374 (1886).  SB1 could (and did) spring from the \u201ccom-\nmon and respectable\u201d impetus to protect minors from \nunproven procedures that can permanently alter their \nlives.  Bray, 506 U.S. at 270; see Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n274-75 (declining to presume animus when \u201clegitimate \nand worthy purposes\u201d supported the Act).  That these \ntreatments are sought primarily by transgender-iden-\ntifying persons cannot alone support a presumption of \nanimus, lest this Court\u2019s restrictions on disparate-im-\npact claims disappear.  See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-75; \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20; Bray, 506 U.S. at 270.5   \nB. Heightened scrutiny does not apply to \ntransgender-related classifications.  \nIntermediate scrutiny would not follow anyway.  \nThis Court has never recognized transgender-identify-\ning persons as a suspect class, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n440-41 (listing five protected classes), and it should \nnot add to the short list of protected characteristics. \n \n5 Notably, the government is not equating gender dysphoria with \ntransgender status.  It knows that \u201cnot all transgender persons \nhave gender dysphoria.\u201d  J.A. 61.  And like transgender-identify-\ning persons, gender-dysphoric persons can be in both groups cre-\nated by SB1.  Moreover, this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses the ap-\nplication of heightened scrutiny based on disability, infra 47, and \nthe federal government has elsewhere designated gender dyspho-\nria as \u201ca disability,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 40,066, 40,068-69 (May 9, 2024). \n\n45 \n \nThis Court long ago \u201clost interest\u201d in creating new \nquasi-suspect classes beyond the few already recog-\nnized.  Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 318-\n19 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Over the past \nhalf-century, it has declined repeated requests to ex-\npand its list of protected characteristics\u2014declining \nheightened review to homosexual individuals, Wind-\nsor, 570 U.S. at 770; close relatives, Lyng v. Castillo, \n477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); the mentally disabled, \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 441-46; and the aged, Murgia, \n427 U.S. at 313.  Rightfully so.  Both assessing puta-\ntive \u201csuspectness\u201d and applying means-end scrutiny \nverge on a \u201cjudge-empowering interest-balancing in-\nquiry\u201d beyond the judicial ken.  N.Y. State Rifle & Pis-\ntol Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 22 (2022) (quotations \nomitted).  This Court should not reopen that door.   \nAnd it certainly should not recognize a new quasi-\nsuspect class here.  To justify heightened scrutiny, this \nCourt has asked whether a \u201cdiscrete group\u201d warrants \nspecial protection in light of its \u201cimmutable\u201d charac-\nteristics, \u201cpolitical[] powerless[ness],\u201d and history of \ndiscriminatory treatment.  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  The \ngovernment falls short on each.   \nFirst, transgender-identifying persons do not \u201cex-\nhibit obvious, immutable, or distinguishing character-\nistics that define them as a discrete group.\u201d  Pet. App. \n45a (quoting Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 \n(1987)).  No one argues that transgender status is an \n\u201cimmutable\u201d characteristic.  U.S. Br. 30; L.W. Br. 38. \nNor is there a credible claim that transgender status \nis \u201cobvious,\u201d since gender identity turns on each per-\nson\u2019s internal and often fluid \u201csense of belonging to a \n\n46 \n \nparticular gender.\u201d  J.A. 9; see WPATH-8 at S41.  And \nfar from being a \u201cdiscrete group,\u201d U.S. Br. 30, \n\u201ctransgender\u201d can describe \u201ca huge variety of gender \nidentities and expressions,\u201d WPATH-8 at S15.  Accord-\ning to WPATH, a transgender-identifying person can \nbe \u201cmore than one gender identity simultaneously or \nat different times (e.g., bigender),\u201d \u201cnot have a gender \nidentity or have a neutral gender identity (e.g., \nagender or neutrois),\u201d \u201chave gender identities that en-\ncompass or blend elements of other genders (e.g., pol-\nygender, demiboy, demigirl),\u201d or \u201chave a gender that \nchanges over time (e.g., genderfluid).\u201d  Id. at S80, S88, \nS252.  As the government\u2019s amici put it, \u201ctransgender\u201d \nis an \u201cumbrella term\u201d that covers \u201cvaried groups.\u201d Br. \nof American Psychological Association as Amicus Cu-\nriae 6 n.7.  \nSecond, \nit \nblinks \nreality \nto \nassert \nthat \ntransgender-identifying persons do not \u201cwield political \npower.\u201d  U.S. Br. 30.  The current Administration has \nprioritized \u201cPreventing and Combating Discrimina-\ntion on the Basis of Gender Identity\u201d across Executive \nBranch functions.  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. \nReg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  The current President has \n\u201cappointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ lead-\ners.\u201d  White House, A Proclamation on Transgender \nDay of Visibility (Mar. 30, 2023), perma.cc/VZN6-\n4ATC.  And federal agencies have written gender-\nidentity directives into every nook and cranny of fed-\neral law, creating new transgender-specific regula-\ntions \nfor \nthe \nworkplace, \neducational \nsystem, \nhealthcare \nfield, \nand \nfoster-care \nprograms.  \nTransgender-identifying persons have flexed their po-\n\n47 \n \nlitical muscle at the state level, too, persuading legis-\nlatures to provide enhanced statutory rights.  E.g., \nCal. Educ. Code \u00a7221.5(f); Va. Code Ann. \u00a738.2-3449.1; \nWash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a728A.642.080.  Against this \nbackdrop (and with more than a third of the U.S. \nHouse in support, see Br. of 164 Members of Congress \nas Amicus Curiae), it is impossible to argue that \ntransgender-identifying persons are \u201cpolitically pow-\nerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract \nthe attention of lawmakers.\u201d  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n445.  That they have not found success on every issue \nin every State does not prove powerlessness.  Pet. App. \n46a. \nThird, the government and plaintiffs cannot rest \ntheir case for heightened scrutiny on a \u201chistory of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  L.W. Br. 38.  In Cleburne, the Court de-\nclined to hold that the mentally disabled constituted a \nquasi-suspect class \u201cdespite a history of compulsory \nsterilization, exclusion from public schools, and a sys-\ntem of \u2018state-mandated segregation and degradation\u2019 \n\u2018that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed \nparalleled, the worst excesses of Jim Crow.\u2019\u201d  Eknes-\nTucker, 114 F.4th at 1266 (Lagoa, J., concurring) \n(quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 462-63 (Marshall, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part)).  The answer to \nfurther instances of \u201cinvidious\u201d discrimination, the \nCourt explained, was to analyze animus case by case, \n\u201cnot to create a new quasi-suspect classification and \nsubject all governmental action based on that classifi-\ncation to more searching evaluation.\u201d Cleburne, 473 \nU.S. at 446.  Likewise, laws regulating the physically \ndisabled fall under rational-basis review despite the \nhistory of discrimination against that group.  Board of \n\n48 \n \nTrustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365-68 (2001).  The \nchallengers nowhere explain why transgender-identi-\nfying persons warrant more favorable treatment. \nAt bottom, creating a new quasi-suspect class will \nremove \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d from the \u201carena of pub-\nlic debate and legislative action\u201d and vest them in the \nfederal judiciary.  Pet. App. 45a.  \u201cBathrooms and \nlocker rooms.  Sports teams and sports competitions.  \nOthers are sure to follow.\u201d  Pet. App. 45a.  And this \nCourt, rather than the democratic process, would have \nto resolve every last issue through open-ended interest \nbalancing.  It should not start down that path.    \nIV. SB1 Survives Constitutional Scrutiny \nSB1 passes constitutional review under any stand-\nard.  \u201c[L]ike other health and welfare laws,\u201d it war-\nrants only rational-basis scrutiny, Dobbs, 597 U.S. at \n301, and easily satisfies that test, Pet. App. 48a-50a.  \nEven under intermediate scrutiny, SB1 poses no con-\nstitutional problem.  Its age- and use-based limits per-\nmissibly serve \u201cimportant\u201d ends through \u201csubstan-\ntially related\u201d means, Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, par-\nticularly given lawmakers\u2019 \u201cwide discretion\u201d in areas \nof \u201cmedical and scientific uncertainty,\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.   \nA. Tennessee has compelling governmental \ninterests. \nAll agree that Tennessee\u2019s \u201cinterest in safeguard-\ning the physical and psychological well-being of a mi-\nnor is compelling.\u201d  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, \n756-57 (1982) (quotations omitted).  Tennessee has \n\u201cauthority, in truth a responsibility, to look after the \n\n49 \n \nhealth and safety\u201d of minors in the State.  Pet. App. \n115a.  And \u201cprotecting minors from dangerous and \nrisky treatments\u201d is part and parcel of that duty.  L.W. \nBr. 41; U.S. Br. 19.   \nTennessee has an independent interest \u201cin pro-\ntecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profes-\nsion.\u201d  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 731.  History is punctu-\nated with shocking stories of medical \u201cabuse [and] ne-\nglect,\u201d id.\u2014with many questionable practices (like lo-\nbotomies and eugenics) initially finding support from \nthe medical establishment.  States thus have an im-\nportant interest in ensuring the integrity and ethics of \nmedical practice within their borders.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a768-33-101(m). \nB. SB1 substantially relates to Tennessee\u2019s \ninterests. \nSB1\u2019s restrictions are in \u201csubstantial furtherance\u201d \nof Tennessee\u2019s interests.  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70.  The \ngovernment second-guesses elected lawmakers\u2019 judg-\nment and asks this Court to do the same.  But this \nCourt should not snuff out legislative developments in \nan evolving area by enshrining the government\u2019s \nskewed science into the Constitution. \nSB1 reflects lawmakers\u2019 resolution of a genuine \nmedical debate.  In circumstances like these, \u201clegisla-\ntive options must be especially broad and courts \nshould be cautious not to rewrite legislation.\u201d  Kansas \nv. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360 n.3 (1997) (quotations \nomitted). \u201cIt is not a part of [the courts\u2019] functions to \nconduct investigations of facts entering into questions \nof public policy.\u201d  Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678, \n\n50 \n \n685 (1888); Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. \n180, 195 (1997).  Federal judges are no more equipped \nto resolve such issues than \u201cpeople picked at random \nfrom the ... telephone directory.\u201d  Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. \nDep\u2019t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 293 (1990) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring).   \nRecognizing as much, the Court has repeatedly \nstressed that lawmakers have \u201cwide discretion to pass \nlegislation in areas where there is medical and scien-\ntific uncertainty.\u201d  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 163; see, e.g., \nDobbs 597 U.S. at 274; Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 360 n.3; \nJones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 364 n.13, 370 \n(1983); Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 \n(1974); Williamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483, 488-\n89 (1955).  Such deference is appropriate even when \nheightened scrutiny applies.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n163-64 (undue-burden standard).  Any other approach \nwould raise the problem of setting \u201cjudicially manage-\nable standards for ascertaining whether a treatment \nis \u2018established\u2019 or \u2018necessary.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation \nomitted).   \nThis deferential framework for assessing legisla-\ntive judgments on unsettled health questions makes \nupholding SB1 straightforward.  SB1\u2019s age- and use-\nbased restrictions reflect lawmakers\u2019 well-informed \njudgment about the rise, risks, and disputed benefits \nof gender-transition procedures.  Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a768-33-101.  After receiving evidence and holding \nhearings, the legislature made specific findings \nsourced in its assessment of the regulated interven-\ntions\u2019 serious \u201crisks and harms\u201d and concerns over mi-\nnors\u2019 ability to provide informed consent.  Id.; see J.A. \n\n51 \n \n893-97, 905.  Against those risks, the legislature con-\ncluded that the putative benefits of such procedures \nremain unproven.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(b), (g).  \nSo it determined that deferring certain gender-transi-\ntion procedures until adulthood was the best course.  \nThat approach substantially furthers lawmakers\u2019 in-\nterest in protecting minors and medical ethics.   \nTennessee\u2019s view of the science is well founded, \nbut the State unquestionably legislated in an area of \nscientific uncertainty.  Many authorities, from leading \nEuropean agencies to courts, have recognized the un-\ncertainty surrounding gender-dysphoria treatments.  \nSee supra 8; Pet. App. 47a-48a; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th \nat 1225; Gibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 221 (5th Cir. \n2019); State v. Loe, 692 S.W.3d 215, 222 (Tex. 2024).  \nSo have pro-intervention advocacy groups like \nWPATH and the Endocrine Society.  WPATH-8 at S33 \n(citing need for \u201cfuture research\u201d); ES Guidelines at \n3874 (emphasizing need for \u201cmore rigorous evalua-\ntions of the effectiveness and safety of endocrine and \nsurgical protocols\u201d).  And SB1 arose after a leading \nprovider of gender-transition procedures for Tennes-\nsee minors admitted she was \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Su-\npra 11.  The uncertainty surrounding minors\u2019 gender-\ntransition treatments provides a \u201csufficient basis\u201d to \nuphold SB1.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 164.   \nThe government, by contrast, would have this \nCourt choose a side in this contested medical debate.  \nU.S. Br. 33-49.  But its arguments for displacing Ten-\nnessee\u2019s legislative judgment fail. \nClear error.  The government says (at 36) that the \nclear-error standard requires upholding the district \n\n52 \n \ncourt\u2019s \u201cfindings.\u201d  But the district court failed to re-\nview Tennessee\u2019s legislative \u201cfactfinding under a def-\nerential standard,\u201d as required.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n165; Turner, 520 U.S. at 195.  And this Court does not \ngive clear-error weight to findings made under an \u201cer-\nroneous standard.\u201d  Inwood Laboratories v. Ives La-\nboratories, 456 U.S. 844, 855, n.15 (1982); Abbott, 585 \nU.S. at 607 (same, when failed to presume good faith).  \nRegardless, the district court did clearly err in \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence in light of the prevailing \nstandards of care and conclusions contained in the \nWPATH and Endocrine Society guidelines.\u201d  Pet. App. \n181a. \nRisks and benefits.  The government\u2019s one-sided \ntelling of the risk-benefit evidence misstates (at 34-44) \nthe legislative record and medical landscape.  Tennes-\nsee did not \u201cignore[]\u201d the \u201cmedical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.\u201d  U.S. Br. 34-36 (capitali-\nzation altered).  In fact, SB1\u2019s findings specifically ref-\nerence the potential \u201cbenefits\u201d of gender-transition \nsurgeries; the legislature just found\u2014relying on Euro-\npean health authorities\u2014a dearth of \u201cevidence that \nthe benefits of these procedures outweigh the risks.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e).  Tennessee\u2019s consider-\nation of evidence was \u201cmeaningful,\u201d even if the govern-\nment would have preferred a different result.     \nThe government\u2019s assertion that SB1 bucks \u201cmed-\nical consensus\u201d (at 36) is hard to take seriously.  Half \nof the States have restricted access to pharmaceutical \nand surgical gender-transition procedures for mi-\nnors\u2014each making their own good-faith findings.  \nDoctors have publicly questioned the propriety of \n\n53 \n \nproviding these interventions to minors.6  And many \nof the European countries that pioneered these treat-\nments have pulled back on their use because of the un-\ncertainty surrounding efficacy and safety.  Supra 8; \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e) (citing shift).  The gov-\nernment cannot manufacture \u201cconsensus\u201d by ignoring \nEuropean health authorities that SB1 references.  \nU.S. Br. 36; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e). \nNor does citing a \u201cmajority\u201d view of \u201cmedical or-\nganization[s]\u201d negate the legislature\u2019s prerogative.  \nU.S. Br. 35.  Organizational say-so does not \u201cshed light \non the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. \nat 273.  Any other approach \u201cwould mean that the \nstate and federal legislatures would lose authority to \nregulate the healthcare industry whenever the subject \nof regulation\u2014the medical profession and drug com-\npanies\u2014found such regulation unnecessary\u201d or mis-\nguided.  Pet. App. 28a.  And what if these organiza-\ntions \u201cchange course in the future? Would the States\u2019 \nauthority reappear at that point?\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.  \nShifting deference from legislative findings to organi-\nzations only redirects power from accountable officials \nto interest groups.   \nThis case highlights the dangers of medical organ-\nizations driving constitutional law.  Below, the chal-\nlengers argued that WPATH\u2019s Guidelines reflect \u201c[t]he \nbest evidence of the correct standard of care.\u201d  Pet. \nApp.  29a.  And they convinced the district court to rely \n \n6 Kaltiala et al., Youth Gender Transition Is Pushed Without Ev-\nidence, Wall St. J. (July 13, 2023), perma.cc/P9GM-MHF7. \n\n54 \n \non WPATH\u2019s Guidelines as the framework for \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 181a.  Now, \nwith WPATH\u2019s credibility shot, the government turns \n(at 35) to other organizations\u2014the AAP and the Amer-\nican Medical Association\u2014that push the same poli-\ncies.  But AAP\u2019s positions have been debunked too.  \nJ.A. 448-49; Appendix 2, D.Ct.Doc. 113-3 at 184-91.  \nThe Constitution does not require States to play \nwhack-a-mole with whatever advocacy organization\u2019s \nstance suits challengers\u2019 needs.   \nThe government invokes the oft-repeated claim \nthat laws like SB1 increase suicide risk and mental-\nhealth problems.  U.S. Br. 36-38; L.W. Br. 44-45.  But \n\u201creal, hard science\u201d for this position is lacking.  Florida \nv. HHS, 2024 WL 3537510, at *16 (M.D. Fla. July 3, \n2024).  No studies document a reduction in suicide \nrates due to gender-transition interventions\u2014as the \nlauded Cass Review noted.  J.A. 398-401, 671-75; Cass \nReview at 33.  And the evidence supporting mitigated \nsuicidality is inconclusive and conflicts with other \nstudies\u2014including one showing that hormonal inter-\nventions increased mental distress.  J.A. 400-01, 452-\n55, 462-67, 664-70; Florida, 2024 WL 3537510, at *19 \nn.17. \nThe government cannot dodge the countervailing \nrisks posed by gender-transition interventions.  The \ngovernment downplays desistence (at 41) with expert \ntestimony asserting that adolescent desistence is \n\u201crare[].\u201d  But desistence is not theoretical.  Minors can \nand do grow up to regret the life-long results transi-\ntion treatments produce.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n\n55 \n \n101(h).  Apparently, even though \u201cmany detransition-\ners\u201d are telling their tragic stories, \u201c[a]cknowledge-\nment that de-transition exists to even a minor extent \nis considered off limits\u201d for the government.  See \nEknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th at 1269 (Lagoa, J., concur-\nring) (quotations omitted).  The Constitution does not \ncompel lawmakers to shield their eyes from detransi-\ntioners\u2019 experiences.  \nAnd no amount of rose-colored ink overwrites the \ndocumented downsides of puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormones.  Supra 5-6; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n101(b).  The government\u2019s portrayal of the risks con-\ntradicts even the advocacy organizations on which it \nrelies.  Compare U.S. Br. at 3, 42-44, with ES Guide-\nlines at 3874, 3882, 3886-87. \nTailoring.  The government claims (at 44-49) that \nSB1 is both too narrow and too broad.  The govern-\nment\u2019s underinclusiveness argument presumes that \nprescribing these drugs always poses the same \u201crisks.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 44-47; L.W. Br. 19, 42-43.  That premise fails:  \nThe medical risks differ because of biological differ-\nences between boys and girls, supra 30-31, and the \nrisk of desistance is not present in other circumstances \nof medical need.  Moreover, medical risk doesn\u2019t arise \nin a vacuum; it instead must be measured against the \nbenefits of the procedure.  A double mastectomy might \ncarry the same risk when performed on a woman with \nbreast cancer and on a 17-year-old girl who wants to \nidentify as a man.  But the measurable benefits differ.  \nThe contrary view recycles the government\u2019s incorrect \n\n56 \n \nattempt to equate giving minors drugs for gender tran-\nsition with employing the same drugs to treat physical \ndeficiencies or abnormalities.   \nNor do claims of \u201csevere overinclusiv[ity]\u201d work.  \nU.S. Br. 47-49; L.W. Br. 48-50.  SB1 does not \u201cpro-\nhibit[] all treatment for all transgender adolescents.\u201d  \nL.W. Br. 49.  It leaves open \u201cless invasive approaches \nthat are likely to result in better outcomes for the mi-\nnor,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(c)\u2014the watchful-\nwaiting and psychotherapy methods that predomi-\nnated until the past decade, supra 4-5; Pet. App. 29a. \nEven the government seems to accept that provid-\ners should not use \u201cany medical intervention to treat \ngender dysphoria before the onset of puberty.\u201d  U.S. \nBr. 41.  And it has (at least at times) agreed that sur-\ngeries should be off-limits for all minors.  So its tailor-\ning disagreement boils down to disputing SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions on medications from the onset of puberty to \nadulthood.  That argument, though, does not turn on \ndifferential treatment based on sex; it turns on the age \nat which SB1 drew its line.  And so long as \u201cthe age \nclassification in question is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest,\u201d States may draw lines with-\nout \u201cmatch[ing] age distinctions\u201d to the \u201cinterests they \nserve with razorlike precision.\u201d  Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of \nRegents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).   \nThe remaining tailoring arguments also fail.  Even \nif \u201cat least some transgender adolescents would bene-\nfit from the banned treatments,\u201d L.W. Br. 48, that ig-\nnores doctors\u2019 inability to \u201cpredict\u201d which minors will \nlater regret these interventions, J.A. 643.  The govern-\n\n57 \n \nment\u2019s preferred policies\u2014like \u201cgatekeeping,\u201d \u201clicens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements\u201d\u2014like-\nwise fail to account for detransitioners.  U.S. Br. 48.  \nIn any event, intermediate scrutiny does not require \nSB1 to \u201cbe capable of achieving its ultimate objective \nin every instance,\u201d Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70, or mandate \nthat Tennessee allow experimental research on kids, \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1235-36 (Brasher, J., con-\ncurring). \n*** \nMany doctors, States, and countries share Tennes-\nsee\u2019s view on gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors; the federal government and others do not.  This \n\u201cearnest and profound debate about the morality, le-\ngality, and practicality\u201d of controversial medical prac-\ntices can continue only if this Court refrains from con-\nstitutionalizing one side\u2019s position.  Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 735.  The question is not whose assessment of \nthe medical dispute is best, but whether the States in \n1868 ceded their power to enact age- and use-based \nlimits on pharmaceutical interventions like SB1\u2019s.  \nThey did not. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \n \n \n\n58 \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nAdam K.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the United States' petitioner brief on the merits has substantially sharpened and confirmed my understanding of the legal arguments underpinning the challenge to Tennessee's law. My previous beliefs, which were based on the case summary and inferences, have now been replaced with a detailed, evidence-backed model of the petitioner's strategy. My knowledge, once imbalanced towards the respondent's position, is now more symmetrical.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs about the case are now as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Stable Theory, Now Highly Detailed):** The petitioner's brief confirms the two-pronged argument for heightened scrutiny I had anticipated, but it elaborates the reasoning and evidentiary basis with significant depth.\n    *   **Facial Sex Discrimination (Argument I.A):** This argument is now crystal clear. The petitioner asserts that SB1 explicitly uses sex as a classification. The brief's core example is that a doctor can prescribe testosterone to a minor male for the purpose of affirming his male identity (e.g., for hypogonadism) but is prohibited from prescribing the exact same medication to a minor female for the purpose of affirming her male identity. This differential treatment based on the congruence between a minor's sex at birth and their identity triggers heightened scrutiny under precedents like ***United States v. Virginia (VMI)*** and ***Sessions v. Morales-Santana***. The brief directly refutes the Sixth Circuit's \"equal application\" logic, arguing that prohibiting a treatment for both sexes for the same purpose is still a sex-based classification.\n    *   **Transgender Status as Sex Discrimination (Argument I.B):** The brief formally extends the logic of ***Bostock v. Clayton County*** from Title VII to the Equal Protection Clause. The argument is that discrimination against a person for being transgender is inherently discrimination \"because of... sex\" because the very concept of \"transgender\" is unintelligible without reference to the sex assigned at birth. Therefore, laws targeting transgender individuals are sex-based classifications that warrant heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **Failure to Survive Heightened Scrutiny (Argument II):** The brief constructs a comprehensive argument that the law cannot survive heightened scrutiny's \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" standard.\n        *   **Illegitimate State Interest:** The petitioner weaponizes the statute's own text, pointing to the stated goal of \"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\" and preventing them from becoming \"disdainful of their sex\" (Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)) as direct evidence of a discriminatory purpose, not a legitimate health objective. This is framed as an attempt to enforce stereotypes, which is impermissible under cases like ***Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan***.\n        *   **Severe Underinclusivity:** The law is painted as irrational because it bans puberty blockers and hormones for gender affirmation while permitting their \"off-label\" use for minors for many other conditions (e.g., precocious puberty, endometriosis, gynecomastia). This demonstrates that the state's concern is not with the medications themselves, but with the specific purpose for which they are used.\n        *   **Severe Overinclusivity:** The law's categorical ban is framed as a blunt instrument that overrides the consensus of every major American medical association, disregards individualized patient assessment, and nullifies parental consent. It prevents doctors from providing medically necessary care that is the established standard for treating gender dysphoria.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Stable):** My understanding of Tennessee's defense, informed by amicus briefs, remains stable. I still anticipate a multi-pronged attack focused on:\n    *   **Limiting Precedent:** Arguing that ***Bostock***'s logic should not apply to the Equal Protection Clause.\n    *   **Deconstructing the Class:** Arguing that \"transgender\" is not a cognizable or suspect class deserving heightened protection.\n    *   **Reframing the Law:** Characterizing the law as a regulation of medical *conduct* under the state's traditional police powers, thus warranting only rational basis review.\n    *   **Pitting Rights Against Each Other:** Framing the issue as a conflict between the rights of women and the recognition of \"gender identity.\"\n\n**Summary of Evolved Belief State:**\n\nThe receipt of the petitioner's brief has balanced my understanding of the central legal conflict. The clash is now clearly defined. On one side, the United States presents a classic Equal Protection argument, meticulously grounded in the Court's modern sex discrimination jurisprudence (*VMI*, *Sessions*) and buttressed by the logic of *Bostock*. They portray Tennessee's law as an irrational and discriminatory outlier that is inconsistent with medical science and constitutional principles. On the other side, Tennessee and its allies are poised to ask the Court to fundamentally rethink or limit its recent jurisprudence on sex discrimination. My predictive model is no longer just about whether the Court will apply heightened scrutiny, but *how* it will navigate the direct conflict between the petitioner's precedent-based argument and the respondent's call to cabin the reach of those same precedents. The next critical piece of evidence is the respondent's own merits brief, which will reveal how they choose to directly counter the petitioner's detailed factual and legal claims.",

Carhart? The respondent's brief has built a powerful case around these very points, offering a clear 'off-ramp' for the Court to uphold the law. The petitioner's reply brief is the single most important remaining document for understanding how these critical legal battles will be fought. It will reveal the petitioner's strategy for neutralizing the respondent's most potent arguments (Feeney, Geduldig, Carhart), which is essential for modeling the likely reasoning of the median justices. The Task EIG is therefore extremely high. The Design EIG is also high because this action provides a masterclass in tracking 'precedent battles'\u2014observing how a sophisticated litigant (the Solicitor General) attempts to dismantle a carefully constructed, precedent-based defense is a highly generalizable lesson for predicting outcomes in future complex constitutional cases.",

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatients in appropriate cases.2  \n \n2 Those include (among others) the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospi-\ntal; the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital; the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hos-\npital in Columbus, Ohio; the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pitts-\nburgh; Duke Children\u2019s Hospital & Health Center; the Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia; Children\u2019s National Hospital in the \n \n\n7 \n \nB. Tennessee SB1 \n1. Puberty blockers have been used to treat gender \ndysphoria for 20 years and precocious puberty for more \nthan 30 years.  J.A. 964, 967.  And hormone therapy has \nbeen used even longer\u2014for at least 60 years to treat \ngender dysphoria in adults, and at least 20 years in ad-\nolescents.  See Pet. App. 2a, 5a, 265a. \nIn the last three years, however, state legislatures \nhave adopted a wave of bans on gender-affirming care \nfor minors based on model legislation and legislative \nfindings circulated by advocacy groups.  In 2021, Arkan-\nsas became the first state to enact a ban.  See Ark. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 20-9-1502(a).  In 2022, Alabama followed.  See \nAla. Code \u00a7 26-26-4.

See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B), 68-33-103(a)(1).5  \nSB1 defines \u201c[s]ex\u201d as the \u201cimmutable characteristics of \nthe reproductive system that define the individual as \nmale or female, as determined by anatomy and genetics \nexisting at the time of birth.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-102(9).  \nBecause SB1\u2019s prohibition applies only when a cov-\nered treatment is prescribed to allow individuals to live \nin conformity with a gender identity other than their \nsex assigned at birth, the law does not restrict the \n \n4 See, e.g., Tenn. Pub. Ch. 285 (enacted Apr. 28, 2023) (Tenn.

The law also explicitly exempts those treat-\nments when they are prescribed \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s con-\ngenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical \ninjury.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  The \nterms \u201c[c]ongenital defect\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d are defined to \ninclude an \u201cabnormality present in a minor that is in-\nconsistent with the normal development of a human be-\ning of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d but specifically exclude \u201cgender \ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, [and] gender in-\ncongruence.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(2).   \nViolations of SB1 are punishable by civil penalties of \n$25,000 for each prohibited treatment, professional dis-\ncipline, and potential civil liability in private suits.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-105 to 68-33-107.  The law took ef-\nfect on July 1, 2023. \nC. The Present Controversy \n1. Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and, after \nexpedited briefing, reversed the preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 1a-101a; see id. at 102a-124a (stay opinion).6   \na. As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit rejected pri-\nvate plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim.  Pet. App. 30a-\n50a.  The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.  The plaintiffs in that case have also sought certiorari.  \nSee Doe 1 v. Kentucky, petition for cert. pending, No. 23-492 (filed \nNov. 3, 2023). \n\n14 \n \nrationally concluded that SB1 was an appropriate re-\nsponse to perceived risks and uncertainties associated \nwith puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  Pet. App. \n49a-50a.  The court acknowledged the countervailing ev-\nidence reflected in the district court\u2019s findings, which it \ndid not question.  Id. at 50a.  But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb. Judge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  Under SB1, \nJudge White emphasized, \u201cmedical procedures that are \npermitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.\u201d  Id. at 72a (citation omitted).  And \nJudge White explained that SB1 \u201ccondition[s] the avail-\nability of procedures on a minor\u2019s conformity with soci-\netal expectations associated with the minor\u2019s assigned \nsex\u201d by \u201cbar[ring] treatment when sought \u2018for the pur-\npose of\u200a\u2019 inducing physiological changes, like secondary \nsex characteristics, that are \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 how so-\nciety expects boys and girls to appear.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)).   \n \nJudge White concluded that SB1 cannot withstand \nheightened scrutiny because its \u201ctext[] effectively re-\nveal[s] that [its] purpose is to force boys and girls to \nlook and live like boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L. Stutzman, Long-term use of antidepressants, mood \nstabilizers, and antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a focus on \nappropriate deprescribing, 11 Mental Health Clinician 320, 329-330 \n(2021). \n12 See, e.g., Ankita Nanda et al., Adverse Effects of Stimulant In-\nterventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): \nA Comprehensive Systematic Review, 15 Cureus, no. 9, at 9 (Sept. \n2023); Natalia M. Wojnowski et al., Effect of stimulants on final \nadult height, 35 J. of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism 1337 \n(2022). \n13 Jeffrey R. Strawn et al., Adverse Effects of Antidepressant \nMedications and their Management in Children and Adolescents, \n43 Pharmacotherapy 675, 683-684 (2023). \n\n48 \n \npuberty blockers provided to treat gender dysphoria for \nall transgender minors under all circumstances.   \nIndeed, SB1 makes no effort\u2014none\u2014to tailor its re-\nstriction to the specific risks with which it is ostensibly \nconcerned.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the respondent's (Tennessee's) brief on the merits has provided the complete counter-argument to the petitioner's case, bringing the central legal and factual disputes into sharp, adversarial focus. My understanding of Tennessee's defense, previously based on inferences, is now a detailed, precedent-grounded model. The core of the case is now clearly a clash between two fundamentally different views of the Equal Protection Clause and the state's power to regulate medicine.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Stable):** My detailed understanding of the United States' arguments remains unchanged. The petitioner's case rests on the assertion that SB1 is a form of sex discrimination that triggers and fails heightened scrutiny. This is based on two pillars:\n    *   **Facial Sex Discrimination:** The law treats minors differently based on the congruence of their sex and their gender identity, a classic sex-based classification under precedents like ***United States v. Virginia (VMI)***.\n    *   **Transgender Status as Sex Discrimination:** The logic of ***Bostock v. Clayton County*** should be extended from Title VII to the Equal Protection Clause, making discrimination against transgender individuals inherently sex discrimination.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Stable Theory, Now Highly Detailed):** The respondent's brief confirms the defensive strategies I anticipated but elaborates them with specific legal architecture and key precedential choices. Tennessee's strategy is to dismantle the petitioner's argument for heightened scrutiny at every step and, failing that, to argue the law survives any level of scrutiny.\n    *   **Primary Framing: Regulation of Procedure, Not People.** The brief's foundational argument is that SB1 is a routine exercise of the state's police power to regulate medicine. It frames the law as setting \"age- and use-based limits on medical procedures,\" not classifying individuals. The distinction is between *why* a drug is used (gender transition vs. other medical needs), not *who* is using it. This framing is designed to secure rational basis review from the outset.\n    *   **Rebuttal to Sex Discrimination (Argument II):** This is the core of their legal defense, directly countering the petitioner's main claim.\n        *   **No Sex-Based Line:** The brief asserts the law is facially neutral because it applies equally to boys and girls seeking these treatments *for the purpose of gender transition*. They heavily rely on ***Geduldig v. Aiello*** (which held that discrimination based on pregnancy was not sex discrimination) to argue that a law can have a disparate impact on one sex without being a sex-based classification.\n        *   ***Bostock* Is Inapplicable to Equal Protection:** This is a critical firewall. Tennessee argues that importing *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test from a statute (Title VII) into the constitutional Equal Protection context would be a \"doctrinal revolution.\" They contrast *Bostock* with core Equal Protection precedents like ***Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney***, which requires proof of discriminatory *purpose* (\"because of,\" not merely \"in spite of\" an adverse effect), a much higher bar.\n        *   **Alternative Argument: Not \"Similarly Situated\":** As a fallback, the brief argues that even if the law were viewed as sex-based, boys and girls are not \"similarly situated.\" For example, a boy with hypogonadism and a girl seeking to transition are not medically equivalent, justifying different treatment under the law. This invokes the logic of cases like ***Michael M. v. Superior Court***.\n    *   **Rebuttal to Transgender Discrimination (Argument III):**\n        *   **No Classification by Status:** The brief argues SB1 does not classify based on \"transgender status\" but rather regulates specific medical *conduct*. They cite ***Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic*** (holding that opposition to abortion is not animus against women) to support the idea that regulating a procedure associated with a group is not the same as discriminating against the group itself.\n        *   **No New Suspect Class:** Tennessee explicitly argues against creating \"transgender status\" as a new quasi-suspect classification, noting the Court has not done so in nearly 50 years and invoking the cautionary approach of ***City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr***.\n    *   **Survival Under Any Scrutiny (Argument IV):** This is the ultimate fallback.\n        *   **Compelling State Interests:** The state's interests are framed as protecting children from \"life-altering\" and \"uncertain\" medical interventions and regulating the medical profession.\n        *   **Factual Counter-Narrative:** The brief aggressively attacks the petitioner's claim of a \"medical consensus.\" It builds a counter-narrative of profound \"medical and scientific uncertainty,\" heavily citing the systematic reviews and policy reversals in European countries (e.g., the UK's Cass Review) and the differing legislative judgments of half the states.\n        *   **Key Precedent for Deference:** The brief repeatedly invokes ***Gonzales v. Carhart***, where the Court deferred to Congress's judgment in banning a specific abortion procedure despite medical disagreement. This precedent is a direct appeal for judicial deference to the legislature in the face of scientific debate.\n\n**Summary of Evolved Belief State:**\n\nThe receipt of the respondent's brief has fully illuminated the legal and factual battlegrounds. The case is now a direct confrontation between two competing constitutional visions. The petitioner's vision extends modern sex discrimination jurisprudence (*VMI*, *Bostock*) to protect transgender minors. The respondent's vision emphasizes federalism, legislative deference, and a more constrained reading of the Equal Protection Clause, seeking to wall it off from *Bostock*'s statutory logic by using precedents like *Feeney* and *Geduldig*.\n\nMy predictive model is now focused on two key questions:\n1.  **The *Bostock* Question:** Will the Court import *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test into its Equal Protection analysis, or will it accept Tennessee's argument that the constitutional standard from *Feeney* (discriminatory purpose) is distinct and controlling?\n2.  **The *Carhart* Question:** How much weight will the Court give to the \"scientific uncertainty\" narrative? Will it defer to Tennessee's legislative judgment as it did for Congress in *Gonzales v. Carhart*, or will it find the state's justification to be a pretext for discrimination?\n\nThe respondent's brief provides a clear, precedent-based \"off-ramp\" for the Court's conservative majority to uphold the law without directly overturning *Bostock* or other precedents, simply by declining to extend their logic. The next crucial evidence will be the petitioner's reply brief, which must now directly counter Tennessee's arguments about *Feeney*, *Geduldig*, and *Carhart*.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the Petitioner's (United States) opening brief on the merits provides a definitive and detailed blueprint of their legal strategy. My previous understanding, which correctly identified the core theories of both sides, is now substantially deepened with the specific textual evidence, precedential choices, and argumentative framing the U.S. will use to persuade the Court. The clash between the petitioner's Equal Protection theory and the respondent's states' rights/medical regulation theory is now grounded in the primary source document for the petitioner.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Theory Confirmed, Now Highly Detailed and Grounded in Text):** The petitioner's brief confirms that their central argument is that SB1 is a form of sex discrimination that fails heightened scrutiny. The brief meticulously constructs this argument on two primary pillars, with a clear strategic emphasis on the first.\n    *   **Primary Argument: Classic Sex-Based Classification (The *VMI* Argument):** The brief's lead argument is that SB1 is facially discriminatory based on sex, in the most traditional sense.\n        *   **Core Framing:** The law's application depends entirely on a minor's sex. The brief crystallizes this with a simple, powerful example: \"a teenager whose sex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testosterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teenager assigned female at birth cannot.\" This framing is designed to cut through the respondent's \"regulation of procedure\" argument by showing the *identity of the patient* (their sex) is the dispositive factor.\n        *   **Precedential Grounding:** This argument is rooted firmly in the Court's core sex discrimination jurisprudence: ***United States v. Virginia (VMI)***, ***Sessions v. Morales-Santana***, and ***Reed v. Reed***.\n        *   **Direct Rebuttal to Anticipated Defenses:** The brief preemptively dismantles the respondent's reliance on cases like ***Geduldig v. Aiello*** (pregnancy) and ***Michael M. v. Superior Court*** (statutory rape), arguing those cases involved \"real differences\" between sexes that are irrelevant here. The petitioner's point is that there is no \"real difference\" justifying why a boy can get testosterone for one reason but a girl cannot for another.\n    *   **Secondary Argument: Transgender Status as Sex Discrimination (The *Bostock* Argument):** The brief presents the extension of ***Bostock v. Clayton County***'s logic as a second, independent reason for heightened scrutiny. Its placement as the secondary argument is a significant strategic signal, suggesting the petitioner sees the classic sex-classification claim as the more direct and perhaps more winnable path.\n    *   **Attack on the State's Justification:** This is a newly detailed and critical component of my belief state. The petitioner's brief moves to dismantle the state's asserted interests, arguing they are illegitimate and pretextual.\n        *   **Illegitimate Purpose:** The brief seizes on the statute's own text, which states an interest in \"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\" and preventing them from becoming \"disdainful of their sex.\" The petitioner frames this as an impermissible state interest in enforcing gender stereotypes, directly analogous to the justifications rejected in ***VMI*** and ***J.E.B. v. Alabama***.\n        *   **Pretext (Underinclusivity):** The brief makes a powerful underinclusivity argument, noting that SB1 bans puberty blockers and hormones *only* for gender transition, while permitting their \"off-label\" use for minors with other conditions like precocious puberty, endometriosis, or gynecomastia. This is a direct factual assault on the respondent's claim to be neutrally regulating dangerous drugs for child safety. The argument is now clear: the law is not about the *drug*; it's about the *purpose* and the *person*.\n        *   **Countering the \"Scientific Uncertainty\" Narrative:** The brief directly confronts the respondent's *Gonzales v. Carhart* defense by building a counter-narrative of \"medical consensus,\" citing the AMA, AAP, WPATH, and the practices of leading children's hospitals. This is intended to show that Tennessee's \"uncertainty\" claim is a manufactured pretext for discrimination, not a good-faith legislative judgment deserving of deference.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Stable Theory, Now Facing Specific Rebuttals):** My understanding of Tennessee's defense remains stable, but the petitioner's brief clarifies the exact arguments it must now overcome. Tennessee's case, centered on framing SB1 as a medical regulation subject to rational basis review, must now contend with:\n    *   The petitioner's simple, intuitive sex-based classification example (the testosterone hypothetical).\n    *   The petitioner's argument that the state's *own stated purpose* is an unconstitutional exercise in enforcing gender stereotypes.\n    *   The petitioner's detailed list of conditions for which the \"dangerous\" drugs are still permitted for minors, which gives factual teeth to the charge of pretext.\n\n**Summary of Evolved Belief State:**\n\nThe petitioner's opening brief has sharpened the entire case. While my prior model correctly identified the competing legal frameworks, I now have a much clearer view of the petitioner's tactical choices. They are leading with a classic, almost minimalist, sex-discrimination argument under *VMI*, which provides an \"off-ramp\" for a majority to rule in their favor without needing to constitutionalize *Bostock*'s statutory reasoning.\n\nMy predictive model is now refined and focused on these key questions:\n\n1.  **The Classification Question:** Will the Court accept the petitioner's simple framing that allowing a drug for a boy but not a girl to affirm a male identity is a facial sex-based classification (*VMI*)? Or will it accept Tennessee's argument that this is a neutral regulation of a medical *procedure* where the sexes are not \"similarly situated\" (*Geduldig*)? The petitioner's choice to lead with the *VMI* argument makes this the central battle.\n2.  **The Pretext Question (The *Carhart* Rebuttal):** How will the Court view the law's glaring underinclusivity? Will it see the permission of these drugs for other pediatric conditions as fatal to the state's child-safety rationale, proving it is a pretext for discrimination? Or will it accept the state's distinction and grant deference to its legislative judgment in the face of competing medical narratives, following the model of *Gonzales v. Carhart*? The petitioner's brief has made the pretext argument significantly more potent.\n\nThe next crucial evidence will be the respondent's brief on the merits, which must now directly answer these sharpened attacks, particularly the charge of underinclusivity and the argument that its own statutory language reveals an unconstitutional purpose.",

The Task EIG is maximal (1.0) because this action directly targets the primary source of my current uncertainty.

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet.

See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn.

Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and, after \nexpedited briefing, reversed the preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 1a-101a; see id. at 102a-124a (stay opinion).6   \na. As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit rejected pri-\nvate plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim.  Pet. App. 30a-\n50a.  The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.  The plaintiffs in that case have also sought certiorari.  \nSee Doe 1 v. Kentucky, petition for cert. pending, No. 23-492 (filed \nNov. 3, 2023). \n\n14 \n \nrationally concluded that SB1 was an appropriate re-\nsponse to perceived risks and uncertainties associated \nwith puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  Pet. App. \n49a-50a.  The court acknowledged the countervailing ev-\nidence reflected in the district court\u2019s findings, which it \ndid not question.  Id. at 50a.  But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb. Judge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  Under SB1, \nJudge White emphasized, \u201cmedical procedures that are \npermitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.\u201d  Id. at 72a (citation omitted).  And \nJudge White explained that SB1 \u201ccondition[s] the avail-\nability of procedures on a minor\u2019s conformity with soci-\netal expectations associated with the minor\u2019s assigned \nsex\u201d by \u201cbar[ring] treatment when sought \u2018for the pur-\npose of\u200a\u2019 inducing physiological changes, like secondary \nsex characteristics, that are \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 how so-\nciety expects boys and girls to appear.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)).   \n \nJudge White concluded that SB1 cannot withstand \nheightened scrutiny because its \u201ctext[] effectively re-\nveal[s] that [its] purpose is to force boys and girls to \nlook and live like boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, while an internal reasoning step, serves to confirm and solidify my understanding of the legal landscape by explicitly stating that the opening briefs from both the petitioner (United States) and the respondent (Tennessee) have been analyzed. My previous belief state, which was built on a deep dive into the petitioner's brief and an anticipation of the respondent's arguments, is now confirmed and balanced by a direct understanding of Tennessee's defense.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Confirmed and Detailed):** My detailed understanding of the petitioner's arguments remains unchanged and forms the first pillar of my analysis. The U.S. is arguing for heightened scrutiny based on two distinct sex-discrimination theories, while simultaneously attacking the state's justifications as pretextual.\n    *   **Primary Argument (*VMI* Theory):** The law is a facial sex-based classification because access to a specific medical treatment (e.g., testosterone) is determined by the minor's sex assigned at birth relative to their gender identity.\n    *   **Secondary Argument (*Bostock* Theory):** The law discriminates based on transgender status, which is a form of sex discrimination under the logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County*.\n    *   **Attack on State's Justifications:** The petitioner's brief aggressively argues the state's purported interests are a pretext for discrimination by highlighting:\n        *   **Impermissible Purpose:** The statute's own text reveals an unconstitutional goal of enforcing gender stereotypes (\"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\").\n        *   **Underinclusivity:** The law's exceptions, which permit the same hormones and puberty blockers for other pediatric conditions (precocious puberty, endometriosis), fatally undermine the state's claim that it is neutrally regulating dangerous treatments.\n        *   **Medical Consensus:** The petitioner presents evidence of a broad medical consensus in favor of these treatments to counter the state's narrative of \"scientific uncertainty.\"\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Theory Confirmed):** The new observation confirms that my analysis of the respondent's brief is complete. My prior anticipation of their arguments is now a confirmed belief. Tennessee's defense rests on avoiding heightened scrutiny altogether.\n    *   **Core Framing:** The law is a neutral regulation of specific, controversial medical *procedures*, not a classification based on sex. They argue the sexes are not \"similarly situated\" because the treatments are used for different underlying reasons, attempting to align with precedents like *Geduldig v. Aiello*.\n    *   **Central Defense (*Carhart* Deference):** Tennessee's primary defense is to invoke legislative deference in the face of scientific uncertainty. By framing the medical consensus as unsettled and the treatments as \"experimental\" and \"irreversible,\" they argue the legislature has the authority to \"err on the side of caution\" to protect children. This directly channels the Court's reasoning in *Gonzales v. Carhart*.\n    *   **Level of Scrutiny:** Consequently, Tennessee argues for rational basis review, under which the law should be easily upheld as rationally related to the legitimate state interest of child protection.\n\n**Summary of Evolved Belief State:**\n\nThe core legal conflict is now fully mapped out based on both parties' opening salvos. The case hinges entirely on which framework the Court adopts. There is no middle ground between these two positions.\n\n1.  **Framework 1 (Petitioner): Sex Discrimination.** If the Court accepts that the law is a sex-based classification (either via the *VMI* or *Bostock* path), heightened scrutiny applies. Under this framework, the state's justifications appear weak, especially given the powerful underinclusivity argument (the exceptions for other conditions). The petitioner would likely win.\n2.  **Framework 2 (Respondent): Medical Regulation.** If the Court accepts that this is a neutral regulation of a medical procedure amid scientific uncertainty, rational basis review applies. Under this framework, the Court would grant significant deference to the legislature's policy choices, and the law would almost certainly be upheld, following the *Carhart* model.\n\nMy predictive model is now focused on how the Court will resolve this threshold question of classification. The observation correctly identifies the next, and most critical, piece of evidence: **the petitioner's reply brief**. This document is essential because it will contain the United States' direct, point-by-point rebuttal to Tennessee's *Carhart*-style deference argument and its \"regulation of procedure\" framing. The reply brief will sharpen the final questions for oral argument and reveal which of Tennessee's arguments the U.S. views as most threatening and how they plan to dismantle them.",

          "task_beliefs": "My analysis of the petitioner's opening brief provides a direct, textual foundation for the arguments I had previously modeled. While my high-level understanding of the case's central conflict remains stable, this observation enriches my beliefs with specific statutory references, key legal precedents, and the precise framing used by the United States. My cumulative understanding is now more granular and evidence-based.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Case (Confirmed and Granularly Detailed):** My prior belief about the petitioner's two-pronged sex-discrimination argument is confirmed. I can now ground this belief in the specific text and citations from their brief.\n    *   **Facial Sex Discrimination (*VMI* Theory):** The brief's core argument is that the law is a facial sex-based classification. This is no longer an abstract theory but a concrete assertion based on the law's text. The brief states, \"a teenager whose sex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testosterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teenager assigned female at birth cannot.\" This directly applies the \"equal protection\" logic from precedents like *United States v. Virginia (VMI)* and *Sessions v. Morales-Santana*. The petitioner is explicitly asking the Court to apply heightened scrutiny based on this direct classification.\n    *   **Transgender Status Discrimination (*Bostock* Theory):** The brief confirms the secondary argument that discrimination based on transgender status is inherently sex discrimination, directly citing *Bostock v. Clayton County*. This provides a fallback position for the Court to find a sex-based classification even if it doesn't accept the more direct facial discrimination argument.\n    *   **Attack on State's Justifications (Now with Specific Evidence):**\n        *   **Impermissible Purpose:** My belief that the petitioner would attack the state's purpose is now supported by direct statutory evidence. The brief points to Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), which states an \"interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex,\" as explicit proof of an unconstitutional motive to enforce gender stereotypes, a line of attack supported by cases like *J.E.B. v. Alabama*.\n        *   **Underinclusivity:** The brief provides a specific and powerful list of conditions for which the *exact same medications* (puberty blockers and hormones) remain legal. These include \"delayed or precocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex conditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; and cancer.\" This detailed list makes the underinclusivity argument\u2014that the state is not neutrally regulating dangerous drugs but targeting a specific use\u2014extremely potent. This argument directly invokes the logic of *Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan*.\n        *   **Medical Consensus:** The petitioner's brief actively preempts the \"scientific uncertainty\" defense by citing the WPATH and Endocrine Society guidelines and noting the consensus of the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics. This frames the state's position as being at odds with established medical science, not just one side of a legitimate debate.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Case (Anticipated Defenses Confirmed):** The structure of the petitioner's brief serves to confirm my model of Tennessee's defense. By dedicating sections to refuting the Sixth Circuit's opinion, the petitioner is directly attacking the arguments Tennessee will advance.\n    *   **Rebuttal to \"Regulation of Procedure\" Frame:** The petitioner's brief is designed to dismantle the idea that this is a neutral regulation of a procedure. The heavy emphasis on the law's text (\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)), which defines the prohibition by its *purpose* (i.e., to affirm a transgender identity), is a direct counter to the respondent's anticipated framing.\n    *   **Preemption of *Carhart* Deference:** By establishing a strong medical consensus and highlighting the law's underinclusivity, the petitioner is building a wall against the respondent's expected plea for legislative deference in the face of \"uncertainty,\" which is the core of the *Gonzales v. Carhart* defense. The petitioner's argument is that there is no genuine uncertainty, only a pretext for discrimination.\n\n**Summary of Evolved Belief State:**\n\nThe observation has solidified my understanding of the petitioner's strategy. They are not merely arguing the law is discriminatory; they are using the law's own text and structure to prove it. The central conflict remains the same, but the petitioner's path to victory is now illuminated with specific statutory language and legal precedent.\n\n1.  **Framework 1 (Petitioner): Sex Discrimination.** This path is now paved with specific textual evidence from the Tennessee statute itself (\u00a7 68-33-101(m), \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)) and is buttressed by the powerful underinclusivity argument, now detailed with a list of exempted conditions. If the Court accepts this framework, the state's law appears constitutionally fragile under heightened scrutiny.\n\n2.  **Framework 2 (Respondent): Medical Regulation.** This path requires the Court to look past the law's text and purpose-based definitions, ignore the long list of exceptions, and accept the state's characterization of the medical field as fundamentally uncertain. The petitioner's brief is designed to make this as difficult as possible for the Court to do.\n\nMy predictive focus remains on which of these two frameworks the Court will adopt. The petitioner has laid a strong foundation for the first framework. The next critical data points will be Tennessee's brief, which will formally present their defense, and the petitioner's reply brief, which will be the final, direct rebuttal to Tennessee's arguments before oral argument.",
