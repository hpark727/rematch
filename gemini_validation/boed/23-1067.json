    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strengthened its national air quality standards for ozone, requiring states to submit implementation plans that would prevent their emissions from significantly impacting other states\u2019 air quality. In February 2023, the EPA issued a final rule disapproving the plans submitted by 21 states, including Oklahoma and Utah, after evaluating them using a four-step framework designed to address interstate pollution. Oklahoma and Utah, along with various industry groups, challenged the EPA\u2019s disapproval of their plans in their respective regional circuit courts. The EPA responded by moving to transfer these cases to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, arguing that because the disapprovals were published together in a single Federal Register notice and used a consistent analytical approach, they must be reviewed by the D.C. Circuit rather than regional courts.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the EPA that the challenged rule is nationally applicable, so it granted the EPA\u2019s motions to transfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.",

However, reading the main party's brief is a standard, foundational step in any legal analysis. While it confirms the validity of this basic strategy, it does not teach me a novel or surprising method for SCOTUS prediction in general.

See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. In 2023, EPA published \ndisapprovals of 21 States\u2019 plans implementing \nnational ozone standards. It did so in a single Federal \nRegister notice. The Act specifies that \u201c[a] petition for \nreview of the [EPA\u2019s] action in approving or \npromulgating any implementation plan \u2026 or any \nother final action of the [EPA] under this Act \u2026 which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in\u201d \nthe appropriate regional circuit, while challenges to \n\u201cnationally applicable regulations \u2026 may be filed only \nin\u201d the D.C. Circuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Parties \nfrom a dozen states sought judicial review of their \nrespective state plan disapprovals in their regional \ncircuits.  \nThe Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits held \nthat the plan disapprovals of States within those \ncircuits \nare \nappropriately \nchallenged \nin \ntheir \nrespective regional courts of appeals. In the decision \nbelow, the Tenth Circuit held that challenges to the \ndisapprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans can be \nbrought only in the D.C. Circuit, explicitly disagreeing \nwith the decisions of its sister circuits.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether a final action by EPA taken pursuant to \nits Clean Air Act authority with respect to a single \nState or region may be challenged only in the D.C. \nCircuit because EPA published the action in the same \nFederal Register notice as actions affecting other \nstates or regions and claimed to use a consistent \nanalysis for all States. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners, the State of Oklahoma, by and \nthrough its Attorney General, and the Oklahoma \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, challenged \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapproval \nof \nOklahoma\u2019s \nstate \nimplementation plan in the Tenth Circuit. The State \nof Utah, by and through its Governor, Spencer J. Cox, \nand its Attorney General, Sean D. Reyes, separately \nchallenged \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapproval \nof \nUtah\u2019s \nstate \nimplementation plan, also in the Tenth Circuit.  \nThe Tenth Circuit procedurally consolidated \nOklahoma\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the \nsame agency action filed by Petitioners Oklahoma Gas \n& Electric Company, Tulsa Cement LLC, d/b/a/ \nCentral Plains Cement Company LLC, Republic \nPaperboard Company, and Western Farmers Electric \nCooperative. \nThe Tenth Circuit also procedurally consolidated \nUtah\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the same \nagency action filed by Petitioners PacifiCorp and Utah \nAssociated Municipal Power Systems.  \nThe Environmental Protection Agency and \nAdministrator Michael S. Regan were respondents in \neach challenge.  \n \n \n\niii \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nParties to the Proceeding ........................................... ii \nTable of Authorities .................................................... v \nIntroduction ................................................................ 1 \nOpinions Below ........................................................... 3 \nJurisdiction ................................................................. 3 \nStatutory Provisions Involved .................................... 4 \nStatement ................................................................... 4 \nA.

Under the \nstatute, EPA actions on state implementation plans, \nwhich govern how each State individually implements \nnational air quality standards, are reviewable in the \nregional circuits. As then-Judge Kavanaugh put it, \n\u201cEPA\u2019s \u2018action in approving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan\u2019 is the prototypical \u2018locally or \nregionally applicable\u2019 action that may be challenged \nonly in the appropriate regional court of appeals.\u201d Am. \nRd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, \n455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nIn \n2023, \nEPA \ndisapproved \n21 \nstate \nimplementation plans that States had separately \nprepared and submitted. Each state plan covered a \nsingle State and analyzed only that State\u2019s obligations \nunder the Act, using state-specific reasoning. EPA \nseparately evaluated \u201cthe contents of each individual \nState\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own merits.\u201d 88 Fed. \nReg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023). Because under the \ntext of the statute EPA action on an implementation \nplan is reviewable in the appropriate regional court of \nappeals, Petitioners and other parties from 12 States \nchallenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of their respective state \nplans in the applicable regional circuit.  \nThe Tenth Circuit rejected that straightforward \nvenue determination. According to the Tenth Circuit, \nEPA\u2019s publication of 21 state plan disapprovals in a \nsingle Federal Register notice and application of \n\n2 \n \ncommon statutory interpretations and analytical \nmethods made the state plan disapprovals \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d and therefore reviewable only in the D.C. \nCircuit. Pet.App.12a-13a.  \nThis Court should reject that misinterpretation of \nthe Act\u2019s venue provision. Under Section 7607(b)(1), \nvenue depends on the EPA \u201caction\u201d under review. The \nstatute defines the relevant EPA action by reference \nto the statutory authority EPA is exercising. Here, \nEPA exercised its Section 7410 authority, which \nrequires separate review of each individual State\u2019s \nplan. Each state plan, after all, applies only to a single \nState. Even more clearly, state plan decisions are not \n\u201cnationally applicable,\u201d like the setting of national air \nquality standards. The text of the Clean Air Act thus \ncompels the conclusion that disapprovals of state \nplans are locally applicable actions reviewable in the \nregional courts of appeals.  \nEPA\u2019s choice to lump 21 state plan disapprovals \ninto a single Federal Register notice does not change \nthe state-specific statutory authority EPA was \nexercising or the substance of the action it took. If it \ndid, EPA could manipulate venue by combining two \nlocally applicable but entirely unrelated actions into a \nsingle notice. Nor does it matter that EPA used \nuniform statutory interpretations or some of the same \nanalytical methods across otherwise locally applicable \nactions. Every EPA action incorporates the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the Act. If EPA applied inconsistent \nstatutory interpretations or differing analytical \nframeworks to similar actions under the Act, that \nunexplained inconsistency would be arbitrary and \n\n3 \n \ncapricious. And a venue test that turned on the extent \nto which EPA relied on uniform analytical methods or \nstatutory interpretations would produce complex line-\ndrawing problems that are not contemplated by the \nsimple venue statute Congress enacted.  \nEPA also raised an alternative argument. Based \non a narrow exception in the venue statute, EPA \nargued that the petitions belong in the D.C. Circuit \nbecause EPA designated the disapprovals as \u201cbased on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The Tenth Circuit did not reach this \nquestion, but this Court should. EPA\u2019s alternative \nargument fails. EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on\u201d its \nrejection of each State\u2019s analysis contained in their \nindividual \nplans \nabout \nthe \nspecific \nemissions \nstemming from in-state sources. That is not \u201ca \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  \nFor these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 challenges to \nEPA\u2019s disapprovals of the Oklahoma and Utah state \nimplementation plans belong in the Tenth Circuit. \nThe opinion below must be reversed.  \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the court of appeals (Pet.App.1a-\n19a) is reported at 93 F.4th 1262. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s order transferring venue was \nentered on February 27, 2024. Petitioners timely \npetitioned for certiorari on March 28, 2024. This Court \nhas jurisdiction to review that order on a writ of \ncertiorari under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and 2101(e). \n\n4 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced at \nPet.App.20a-48a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n1. The Clean Air Act centers on the \u201c\u2018core \nprinciple\u2019 of cooperative federalism.\u201d EPA v. EME \nHomer City Generation, L.P., 572 U.S. 489, 511 n.14 \n(2014). It does so by dividing responsibility and \nauthority for assuring air quality between EPA and \nthe States.  \nEPA, for example, establishes National Ambient \nAir \nQuality \nStandards \n(NAAQS) \nfor \ncertain \npollutants, like ozone. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(a)-(b). \nEach State then assumes \u201cprimary responsibility for \nassuring air quality.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(a). States do so \nby establishing state implementation plans, which \n\u201cimplement[], maint[ain], and enforce[]\u201d the national \nstandards based on state-specific considerations. Id. \n\u00a7 7410(a)(1).  \nWhen \nit \ncomes \nto \ndeveloping \nthese \nimplementation plans, \u201cstates, not EPA, drive the \nregulatory process.\u201d Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 411 \n(5th Cir. 2016) (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d). \u201cEach State is given \nwide discretion in formulating its plan.\u201d Union Elec. \nCo. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 250 (1976). For example, a \nplan must \u201cinclude enforceable emissions limitations,\u201d \n\u00a7 7410(a)(2)(A), but \u201cso long as the ultimate effect of a \nState\u2019s choice of emission limitations is compliance \nwith\u201d the \u201cgeneral requirements\u201d of the Act, the State \nmay \nimplement \n\u201cwhatever \nmix \nof \nemissions \n\n5 \n \nlimitations [is] best suited to its particular situation.\u201d \nTrain v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 79 \n(1975). States thus enjoy \u201cconsiderable latitude in \ndetermining specifically how the [NAAQS will] be \nmet.\u201d Id. at 87. \nBy contrast, EPA \u201cis relegated by the Act to a \nsecondary role.\u201d Id. at 79. Once a State develops and \nsubmits its plan, EPA \u201cshall approve\u201d the plan \u201cif it \nmeets all of the applicable requirements of\u201d the Act. \n\u00a7 7410(k)(3). EPA \u201chas no authority to question the \nwisdom of a State\u2019s choices\u201d in developing a state plan. \nTrain, 421 U.S. at 79. EPA may disapprove a state \nplan and promulgate a federal plan for the State only \nif the submitted state plan does not satisfy the statute. \n\u00a7 7410(c)(1).  \n2. The Clean Air Act\u2019s venue provision reinforces \nthis balance between national standards and local \nimplementation. Section 7607(b)(1) grants the courts \nof appeals original jurisdiction over challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions under the Act. And it divides venue \nbetween the regional courts of appeals and the D.C. \nCircuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).   \nCongress provided a list of actions that EPA takes \nunder \u201cspecifically enumerated provisions of the Act\u201d \nthat are reviewable in the regional circuits. Harrison \nv. PPG Indus., Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980). Most \nrelevant here, that list begins with any EPA action \n\u201capproving or promulgating any implementation plan \nunder section 7410 \u2026 or section 7411(d) of this title.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). It also includes other actions that are, \n\n6 \n \nlike implementation plans, by their nature local, such \nas \u201cany order\u201d issued under Sections 7411(j)1 or  7419.2  \nBy contrast, Section 7607(b)(1) directs to the D.C. \nCircuit a separate list of actions, each of which is \nnational in nature. When EPA promulgates \u201cany \nnational primary or secondary ambient air quality \nstandard,\u201d \nnational \nemissions \nstandards \nfor \nhazardous pollutants under Section 7412, standards \nof performance for new sources under Section 7411, or \nemissions standards for motor vehicles under Section \n7521, challenges to those actions must be brought in \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nIn 1977, Congress made two changes to this venue \nprovision. First, Congress added catchalls: \u201cany other \nfinal action of the Administrator under [the] Act which \nis locally or regionally applicable\u201d is reviewable in the \nregional circuit, while \u201cany other nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d by \nEPA is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit. See Pub. L. 95-\n95 (Aug. 7, 1977). Second, after realizing that the \noriginal provision only mentioned EPA\u2019s approval of \nstate plans promulgated under Sections 7410 or 7411, \nCongress added a parenthetical to the provision \ndirecting locally or regionally applicable actions to the \nregional courts of appeals: \u201c(including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under title I).\u201d Pub. \nL. 95-190 (Nov. 16, 1977). \n \n1 Section 7411(j) grants EPA authority to give specific sources \n\u201cwaivers from the\u201d pollution standards \u201cto encourage the use of \nan innovative technological system.\u201d \n2 Sections 7419 authorizes EPA to issue \u201corders\u201d that relate to \na specific \u201cnonferrous smelter.\u201d  \n\n7 \n \nFinally, \nSection \n7607(b)(1) \nestablishes \nan \nexception to the general rules for venue. Suits that \nwould otherwise be filed in a regional circuit must \u201cbe \nfiled only in the [D.C. Circuit] if [the] action is \n[1] based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and [2] if in taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nB. Oklahoma\u2019s \nand \nUtah\u2019s \nState \nImplementation Plans  \n1. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone, \nreducing the national standard from 75 to 70 parts per \nbillion. 80 Fed. Reg. 65,292, 65,293-94 (Oct. 26, 2015). \nEach State therefore developed an implementation \nplan for the revised NAAQS. See \u00a7 7410(a)(1).  \nThese state plans addressed several statutory \nrequirements, including the Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor\u201d \nprovision. See \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). That provision \ndelegates to States the task of ensuring no \u201csource or \nother type of emissions activity within the State\u201d will \nemit \u201cany air pollutant in amounts which will \u2026 \ncontribute \nsignificantly \nto \nnonattainment\u201d \nor \n\u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of the NAAQS by \u201cany \nother State.\u201d Id.; see also Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, \n284 (2024). \nIn addressing their Good Neighbor obligations, \neach state plan relied on state-specific reasoning and \ndata to determine whether that State was significantly \ncontribu\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n49: 20241213171723170_No.2023-1067-106820-20Certificate20of20Compliance.json (score: 0.405)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-1067 \nVide. 23-1068 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nOKLAHOMA, ET AL., \n \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL., \n \nRespondents. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the \ndocument contains  12,902 words, excluding the parts of the document \nthat are exempted by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExecuted on this 13th day of December, 2024.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________________________ \nRina Danielson \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me  \nthis 13th day of December, 2024.  \n \n \n \nMARIANA BRAYLOVSKIY \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026 \n#333862\n\n",

Waldbeser\nLehotsky Keller Cohn LLP\n200 Massachusetts Avenue \nN.W.\nWashington, DC 20001\nCounsel for Petitioners  \nState of Oklahoma and \nOklahoma Department of \nEnvironmental Quality\n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires each State to adopt an \nimplementation \nplan \nfor \nnational \nair \nquality \nstandards, which EPA reviews for compliance with the \nAct. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. In 2023, EPA published \ndisapprovals of 21 States\u2019 plans implementing \nnational ozone standards. It did so in a single Federal \nRegister notice. The Act specifies that \u201c[a] petition for \nreview of the [EPA\u2019s] action in approving or \npromulgating any implementation plan \u2026 or any \nother final action of the [EPA] under this Act \u2026 which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in\u201d \nthe appropriate regional circuit, while challenges to \n\u201cnationally applicable regulations \u2026 may be filed only \nin\u201d the D.C. Circuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Parties \nfrom a dozen states sought judicial review of their \nrespective state plan disapprovals in their regional \ncircuits.  \nThe Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits held \nthat the plan disapprovals of States within those \ncircuits \nare \nappropriately \nchallenged \nin \ntheir \nrespective regional courts of appeals. In the decision \nbelow, the Tenth Circuit held that challenges to the \ndisapprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans can be \nbrought only in the D.C. Circuit, explicitly disagreeing \nwith the decisions of its sister circuits.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether a final action by EPA taken pursuant to \nits Clean Air Act authority with respect to a single \nState or region may be challenged only in the D.C. \nCircuit because EPA published the action in the same \nFederal Register notice as actions affecting other \nstates or regions and claimed to use a consistent \nanalysis for all States. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners, the State of Oklahoma, by and \nthrough its Attorney General, and the Oklahoma \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, challenged \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapproval \nof \nOklahoma\u2019s \nstate \nimplementation plan in the Tenth Circuit. The State \nof Utah, by and through its Governor, Spencer J. Cox, \nand its Attorney General, Sean D. Reyes, separately \nchallenged \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapproval \nof \nUtah\u2019s \nstate \nimplementation plan, also in the Tenth Circuit.  \nThe Tenth Circuit procedurally consolidated \nOklahoma\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the \nsame agency action filed by Petitioners Oklahoma Gas \n& Electric Company, Tulsa Cement LLC, d/b/a/ \nCentral Plains Cement Company LLC, Republic \nPaperboard Company, and Western Farmers Electric \nCooperative. \nThe Tenth Circuit also procedurally consolidated \nUtah\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the same \nagency action filed by Petitioners PacifiCorp and Utah \nAssociated Municipal Power Systems.  \nThe Environmental Protection Agency and \nAdministrator Michael S. Regan were respondents in \neach challenge.  \n \n \n\niii \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nParties to the Proceeding ........................................... ii \nTable of Authorities .................................................... v \nIntroduction ................................................................ 1 \nOpinions Below ........................................................... 3 \nJurisdiction ................................................................. 3 \nStatutory Provisions Involved .................................... 4 \nStatement ................................................................... 4 \nA.

Under the \nstatute, EPA actions on state implementation plans, \nwhich govern how each State individually implements \nnational air quality standards, are reviewable in the \nregional circuits. As then-Judge Kavanaugh put it, \n\u201cEPA\u2019s \u2018action in approving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan\u2019 is the prototypical \u2018locally or \nregionally applicable\u2019 action that may be challenged \nonly in the appropriate regional court of appeals.\u201d Am. \nRd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, \n455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nIn \n2023, \nEPA \ndisapproved \n21 \nstate \nimplementation plans that States had separately \nprepared and submitted. Each state plan covered a \nsingle State and analyzed only that State\u2019s obligations \nunder the Act, using state-specific reasoning. EPA \nseparately evaluated \u201cthe contents of each individual \nState\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own merits.\u201d 88 Fed. \nReg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023). Because under the \ntext of the statute EPA action on an implementation \nplan is reviewable in the appropriate regional court of \nappeals, Petitioners and other parties from 12 States \nchallenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of their respective state \nplans in the applicable regional circuit.  \nThe Tenth Circuit rejected that straightforward \nvenue determination. According to the Tenth Circuit, \nEPA\u2019s publication of 21 state plan disapprovals in a \nsingle Federal Register notice and application of \n\n2 \n \ncommon statutory interpretations and analytical \nmethods made the state plan disapprovals \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d and therefore reviewable only in the D.C. \nCircuit. Pet.App.12a-13a.  \nThis Court should reject that misinterpretation of \nthe Act\u2019s venue provision. Under Section 7607(b)(1), \nvenue depends on the EPA \u201caction\u201d under review. The \nstatute defines the relevant EPA action by reference \nto the statutory authority EPA is exercising. Here, \nEPA exercised its Section 7410 authority, which \nrequires separate review of each individual State\u2019s \nplan. Each state plan, after all, applies only to a single \nState. Even more clearly, state plan decisions are not \n\u201cnationally applicable,\u201d like the setting of national air \nquality standards. The text of the Clean Air Act thus \ncompels the conclusion that disapprovals of state \nplans are locally applicable actions reviewable in the \nregional courts of appeals.  \nEPA\u2019s choice to lump 21 state plan disapprovals \ninto a single Federal Register notice does not change \nthe state-specific statutory authority EPA was \nexercising or the substance of the action it took. If it \ndid, EPA could manipulate venue by combining two \nlocally applicable but entirely unrelated actions into a \nsingle notice. Nor does it matter that EPA used \nuniform statutory interpretations or some of the same \nanalytical methods across otherwise locally applicable \nactions. Every EPA action incorporates the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the Act. If EPA applied inconsistent \nstatutory interpretations or differing analytical \nframeworks to similar actions under the Act, that \nunexplained inconsistency would be arbitrary and \n\n3 \n \ncapricious. And a venue test that turned on the extent \nto which EPA relied on uniform analytical methods or \nstatutory interpretations would produce complex line-\ndrawing problems that are not contemplated by the \nsimple venue statute Congress enacted.  \nEPA also raised an alternative argument. Based \non a narrow exception in the venue statute, EPA \nargued that the petitions belong in the D.C. Circuit \nbecause EPA designated the disapprovals as \u201cbased on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The Tenth Circuit did not reach this \nquestion, but this Court should. EPA\u2019s alternative \nargument fails. EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on\u201d its \nrejection of each State\u2019s analysis contained in their \nindividual \nplans \nabout \nthe \nspecific \nemissions \nstemming from in-state sources. That is not \u201ca \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  \nFor these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 challenges to \nEPA\u2019s disapprovals of the Oklahoma and Utah state \nimplementation plans belong in the Tenth Circuit. \nThe opinion below must be reversed.  \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the court of appeals (Pet.App.1a-\n19a) is reported at 93 F.4th 1262. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s order transferring venue was \nentered on February 27, 2024. Petitioners timely \npetitioned for certiorari on March 28, 2024. This Court \nhas jurisdiction to review that order on a writ of \ncertiorari under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and 2101(e). \n\n4 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced at \nPet.App.20a-48a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n1. The Clean Air Act centers on the \u201c\u2018core \nprinciple\u2019 of cooperative federalism.\u201d EPA v. EME \nHomer City Generation, L.P., 572 U.S. 489, 511 n.14 \n(2014). It does so by dividing responsibility and \nauthority for assuring air quality between EPA and \nthe States.  \nEPA, for example, establishes National Ambient \nAir \nQuality \nStandards \n(NAAQS) \nfor \ncertain \npollutants, like ozone. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(a)-(b). \nEach State then assumes \u201cprimary responsibility for \nassuring air quality.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(a). States do so \nby establishing state implementation plans, which \n\u201cimplement[], maint[ain], and enforce[]\u201d the national \nstandards based on state-specific considerations. Id. \n\u00a7 7410(a)(1).  \nWhen \nit \ncomes \nto \ndeveloping \nthese \nimplementation plans, \u201cstates, not EPA, drive the \nregulatory process.\u201d Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 411 \n(5th Cir. 2016) (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d). \u201cEach State is given \nwide discretion in formulating its plan.\u201d Union Elec. \nCo. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 250 (1976). For example, a \nplan must \u201cinclude enforceable emissions limitations,\u201d \n\u00a7 7410(a)(2)(A), but \u201cso long as the ultimate effect of a \nState\u2019s choice of emission limitations is compliance \nwith\u201d the \u201cgeneral requirements\u201d of the Act, the State \nmay \nimplement \n\u201cwhatever \nmix \nof \nemissions \n\n5 \n \nlimitations [is] best suited to its particular situation.\u201d \nTrain v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 79 \n(1975). States thus enjoy \u201cconsiderable latitude in \ndetermining specifically how the [NAAQS will] be \nmet.\u201d Id. at 87. \nBy contrast, EPA \u201cis relegated by the Act to a \nsecondary role.\u201d Id. at 79. Once a State develops and \nsubmits its plan, EPA \u201cshall approve\u201d the plan \u201cif it \nmeets all of the applicable requirements of\u201d the Act. \n\u00a7 7410(k)(3). EPA \u201chas no authority to question the \nwisdom of a State\u2019s choices\u201d in developing a state plan. \nTrain, 421 U.S. at 79. EPA may disapprove a state \nplan and promulgate a federal plan for the State only \nif the submitted state plan does not satisfy the statute. \n\u00a7 7410(c)(1).  \n2. The Clean Air Act\u2019s venue provision reinforces \nthis balance between national standards and local \nimplementation. Section 7607(b)(1) grants the courts \nof appeals original jurisdiction over challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions under the Act. And it divides venue \nbetween the regional courts of appeals and the D.C. \nCircuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).   \nCongress provided a list of actions that EPA takes \nunder \u201cspecifically enumerated provisions of the Act\u201d \nthat are reviewable in the regional circuits. Harrison \nv. PPG Indus., Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980). Most \nrelevant here, that list begins with any EPA action \n\u201capproving or promulgating any implementation plan \nunder section 7410 \u2026 or section 7411(d) of this title.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). It also includes other actions that are, \n\n6 \n \nlike implementation plans, by their nature local, such \nas \u201cany order\u201d issued under Sections 7411(j)1 or  7419.2  \nBy contrast, Section 7607(b)(1) directs to the D.C. \nCircuit a separate list of actions, each of which is \nnational in nature. When EPA promulgates \u201cany \nnational primary or secondary ambient air quality \nstandard,\u201d \nnational \nemissions \nstandards \nfor \nhazardous pollutants under Section 7412, standards \nof performance for new sources under Section 7411, or \nemissions standards for motor vehicles under Section \n7521, challenges to those actions must be brought in \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nIn 1977, Congress made two changes to this venue \nprovision. First, Congress added catchalls: \u201cany other \nfinal action of the Administrator under [the] Act which \nis locally or regionally applicable\u201d is reviewable in the \nregional circuit, while \u201cany other nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d by \nEPA is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit. See Pub. L. 95-\n95 (Aug. 7, 1977). Second, after realizing that the \noriginal provision only mentioned EPA\u2019s approval of \nstate plans promulgated under Sections 7410 or 7411, \nCongress added a parenthetical to the provision \ndirecting locally or regionally applicable actions to the \nregional courts of appeals: \u201c(including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under title I).\u201d Pub. \nL. 95-190 (Nov. 16, 1977). \n \n1 Section 7411(j) grants EPA authority to give specific sources \n\u201cwaivers from the\u201d pollution standards \u201cto encourage the use of \nan innovative technological system.\u201d \n2 Sections 7419 authorizes EPA to issue \u201corders\u201d that relate to \na specific \u201cnonferrous smelter.\u201d  \n\n7 \n \nFinally, \nSection \n7607(b)(1) \nestablishes \nan \nexception to the general rules for venue. Suits that \nwould otherwise be filed in a regional circuit must \u201cbe \nfiled only in the [D.C. Circuit] if [the] action is \n[1] based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and [2] if in taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nB. Oklahoma\u2019s \nand \nUtah\u2019s \nState \nImplementation Plans  \n1. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone, \nreducing the national standard from 75 to 70 parts per \nbillion. 80 Fed. Reg. 65,292, 65,293-94 (Oct. 26, 2015). \nEach State therefore developed an implementation \nplan for the revised NAAQS. See \u00a7 7410(a)(1).  \nThese state plans addressed several statutory \nrequirements, including the Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor\u201d \nprovision. See \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). That provision \ndelegates to States the task of ensuring no \u201csource or \nother type of emissions activity within the State\u201d will \nemit \u201cany air pollutant in amounts which will \u2026 \ncontribute \nsignificantly \nto \nnonattainment\u201d \nor \n\u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of the NAAQS by \u201cany \nother State.\u201d Id.; see also Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, \n284 (2024). \nIn addressing their Good Neighbor obligations, \neach state plan relied on state-specific reasoning and \ndata to determine whether that State was significantly \ncontributing to nonattainment or interfering with \nmaintenance in downwind States. States worked in \nclose coordination with EPA\u2019s Regional Offices. See, \ne.g., J.A.27a-32a (correspondence between EPA\u2019s \n\n8 \n \nRegion 6 Office and Oklahoma regarding Oklahoma\u2019s \ndraft Good Neighbor plan); No. 23-9509 (10th Cir.), \nJ.A.0069-73 (correspondence between EPA\u2019s Region 8 \nOffice and Utah regarding Utah\u2019s plan). Analyzing the \npotential impacts of emissions from one State to \nanother State\u2019s air quality requires complex computer \nmodels or other analytical methods. Some States, like \nUtah, developed their individual analyses by reference \nto data, modeling, and analytical frameworks \nprovided by EPA. But many state plans declined to \nrely on the materials EPA had developed, which EPA \nhad assured States they could do in pre-submission \nguidance. No. 23-9514 (10th Cir.), J.A.66-75, 98-110.  \nFor instance, Oklahoma relied on region-specific \nmodeling prepared by Texas, rather than EPA\u2019s \nnational \nmodeling, \nto \nevaluate \nits \nprojected \ncontributions to other States. J.A.13a-14a. Oklahoma \nalso \nperformed \na \nsupplemental \n\u201cweight-of-the-\nevidence\u201d analysis of three specific sites to which \nEPA\u2019s \nmodeling \nsuggested \nOklahoma \nmight \nsignificantly contribute ozone, which differed from \nEPA\u2019s default framework for analyzing whether \nprojected ozone contributions were \u201csignificant.\u201d \nJ.A.23a-26a. \nThat \nanalysis \nexplained \nwhy, \nnotwithstanding EPA\u2019s modeling, Oklahoma would \nnot significantly contribute to violations of the \nnational ozone standard at those sites, based on \nemissions trends at those places and Oklahoma\u2019s own \nemissions trends. J.A.26a. \nSimilarly, while Utah\u2019s plan analyzed its future \ncontributions to downwind States by reference to \nEPA\u2019s modeling and data, J.A.37a-39a, Utah applied \n\n9 \n \na weight-of-evidence approach to assess whether \nunder the conditions specific to Utah and Colorado, \nUtah \u201ccontributed significantly\u201d to nonattainment or \n\u201cinterfered with\u201d maintenance in Colorado or other \ndownwind States. J.A.42a-57a. Utah also discussed \nthe sizable contribution of international emissions, \nwildfires, and biogenic (natural source) emissions \u201cto \nillustrate the magnitude of these emissions compared \nto those modeled as coming from Utah.\u201d J.A.42a-51a \nBased \non \nthis \nweight-of-evidence \napproach \nconsidering all the evidence taken together, Utah \nconcluded that its contributions to downwind state air \nquality are not significant and additional emission \nreductions were unnecessary. J.A.57a. \n2. After States submitted their individual state \nplans, EPA reviewed them. It approved 24 state plans. \nAnd, in each approval, EPA asserted that the approval \nwas a locally or regionally applicable action \nreviewable only in an \u201cappropriate circuit,\u201d not the \nD.C. Circuit. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. 22,463 (Apr. 15, \n2022) (Iowa).  \nBut EPA proposed to disapprove 23 state plans, \nwhich it published in 13 separate Federal Register \nnotices.3 Many of the proposed disapproval notices \ncovered a single State, like Utah. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. \n31,470 (May 24, 2022). Other notices grouped together \nseveral States from one of EPA\u2019s regions, like the \ndisapproval notice that included Oklahoma. See, e.g., \n \n3 EPA recently proposed to disapprove the state plans of five \nadditional States. 89 Fed. Reg. 12,666 (Feb. 16, 2024) (Arizona, \nIowa, Kansas, New Mexico, and Tennessee). EPA had previously \napproved the state plans for Iowa and Kansas. \n\n10 \n \n87 Fed. Reg. 9,798 (February 22, 2022) (Arkansas, \nLouisiana, Oklahoma, Texas). And each of EPA\u2019s \nproposed disapprovals\u2014whether issued individually \nor for a regional group of States\u2014was signed by a \nregional EPA administrator. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. \n9,798, 9,835 (Feb. 22, 2022).  \nEPA\u2019s proposed disapprovals examined each \nState\u2019s plan individually, considering each State\u2019s \nspecific submission, emissions sources and trends, and \ndownwind air quality contributions. For example, \nEPA proposed to disapprove Oklahoma\u2019s plan \n\u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed to correctly \n\u201canalyze emissions from the sources and other \nemissions \nactivity \nfrom \nwithin \nthe \nState \nto \ndetermine whether its contributions [to downwind \nStates] were significant.\u201d Id. at 9,823-24. EPA reached \nthat conclusion by, among other reasons, rejecting the \nTexas air quality modeling used by Oklahoma and \nOklahoma\u2019s region-specific \u201cweight of evidence\u201d \nanalysis. Id. at 9,822.   \nEPA\u2019s analysis of Utah\u2019s plan was similarly \ntailored to Utah\u2019s submission. EPA found Utah\u2019s \narguments based on meteorological and air transport \nissues unique to the West unconvincing. 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9,360. EPA also concluded that there were \n\u201ctechnical and legal flaws in [Utah\u2019s] arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and \nnon-anthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of \nupwind versus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nStates and regulated companies submitted \ncomments on the proposed disapprovals, explaining \nwhy each State\u2019s particular circumstances showed the \n\n11 \n \nState\u2019s plan was factually, analytically, and legally \njustified. See, e.g., No. 23-9514 (10th Cir.), J.A.0389-\n0404 (Oklahoma comment letter on EPA\u2019s proposed \nOklahoma state plan disapproval); J.A.58a-67a (Utah \ncomment letter on EPA\u2019s proposed Utah state plan \ndisapproval); J.A.68a-105a (Utah industry comment \nletters). \n3. EPA nevertheless finalized the disapproval of \n21 Good Neighbor plans. But unlike its proposed \ndisapprovals, EPA combined the final disapprovals \ninto a single Federal Register notice. 88 Fed. Reg. at \n9,336. Even so, EPA conceded that its final \ndisapprovals were based on evaluations of \u201cthe \ncontents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on \n[its] own merits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. EPA included \nindividual discussions of each state plan. See id. at \n9,354-9,361. And EPA codified each state plan \ndisapproval in separate subparts of the Code of \nFederal Regulations. See id. at 9,381-84. \nYet EPA argued that its state plan disapprovals \nwere \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d asserting that any \nchallenges \u201cmust be filed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d Id. at \n9,380. EPA offered two reasons. First, its notice \ncovered state plans from \u201ca large number of states \nlocated across the country.\u201d Second, the disapprovals \nwere connected by \u201cthe interdependent nature of \ninterstate pollution transport and the common core of \nknowledge and analysis involved in evaluating the \nsubmitted\u201d state plans. Id.  \n EPA also took the alternative position that the \nrulemaking was \u201cbased on a determination of \n\u2018nationwide scope or effect.\u2019\u201d Id. EPA argued that it \n\n12 \n \nwas relying \u201con a common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis,\u201d including a \n\u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate transport \nframework for assessing obligations.\u201d Id. EPA \nlikewise pointed to its reliance on \u201cthe results from \nnationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d Id. And it \nexplained that it \u201cevaluated each state\u2019s arguments \nfor the use of alternative approaches or alternative \nsets of data with an eye to ensuring national \nconsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable \nresults\u201d between States. Id. at 9,381. \nC. Procedural History \nStates and industry parties in 12 States \nchallenged their respective state implementation plan \ndisapprovals in their regional circuits. In each case, \nEPA moved to dismiss or transfer venue to the D.C. \nCircuit, arguing that its state plan disapprovals were \neither \u201cnationally applicable regulations\u201d or \u201cbased on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d E.g., \nMot. to Transfer, Oklahoma v. EPA, No. 23-9514, Dkt. \nNo. 10983947 (10th Cir. Mar. 16, 2023); Mot. to \nTransfer, Utah v. EPA, No. 23-9509, Dkt. No. \n10983793 (10th Cir. Mar. 16, 2023). This tactic was \nlargely unsuccessful. \nThe Fifth Circuit explained that the text of the \nClean Air Act \u201cmakes clear that the EPA\u2019s relevant \nactions for purposes of the present litigation are its \nvarious [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas v. EPA, No. 23-\n60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (5th Cir. May 1, 2023). \nSo while \u201cthe EPA packaged these disapprovals \ntogether with the disapprovals of eighteen other \nStates \u2026 , the EPA\u2019s chosen method of publishing an \n\n13 \n \naction isn\u2019t controlling.\u201d Id. \u201cWhat controls is the \n[Act]\u201d and the Act \u201cis very clear: The relevant unit of \nadministrative action here is the EPA\u2019s individual \n[state plan] denials.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthe \u2018legal impact\u2019 of \nthe three [state plan] disapprovals is plainly local or \nregional\u201d given that they \u201cinvolve only the regulation \nof Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi emission sources \nand have legal consequences only for Texas, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi facilities.\u201d Id. at *5. Nor \nare the actions challenged in that case \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d because \nEPA\u2019s decisions \u201cwere plainly based on a number of \nintensely factual determinations unique to each \nState.\u201d Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). \n The Fourth Circuit also denied EPA\u2019s motion to \ntransfer. West Virginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 325 (4th \nCir. 2024). It held that EPA\u2019s disapproval was \u201cbased \nentirely on West Virginia\u2019s particular circumstances \nand its analysis of those circumstances,\u201d so it was \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d and \u201cwas not based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Id. \nat 329. It also rejected EPA\u2019s argument that the action \nwas national because it applied \u201ca national standard \nto disapprove a plan,\u201d reasoning if that \u201cwere the \ncontrolling factor, there never could be a local or \nregional action \u2026 because every action of the EPA \npurportedly applies a national standard created by the \nnational statute and its national regulations.\u201d Id. at \n329-30. \nMost recently, the Sixth Circuit reached the same \nconclusion in a published opinion rejecting EPA\u2019s \narguments as part of its opinion on the merits, \n\n14 \n \nKentucky v. EPA, __ F. 4th __, Nos. 23-3216/3225, 2024 \nWL 5001991, at *5-14 (6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024), which \nfollowed an unpublished opinion rejecting EPA\u2019s \nmotion to transfer, Kentucky v. EPA, 2023 WL \n11871967 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023). The Sixth Circuit \nconcluded \nthat \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapprovals \nwere \nnot \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d actions. Kentucky, 2024 WL \n5001991, at *7. Contrary to EPA\u2019s argument, \n\u201c\u00a7 7607(b)(1) focuses on the statute (not the \nrulemaking) to distinguish the EPA actions\u201d and here, \nthe relevant statute \u201crequires the EPA to \u2018act\u2019 on each \nState\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-by-plan basis.\u201d Id. at *8-\n9 (citing, inter alia, \u00a7 7410). Finally, it rejected EPA\u2019s \nargument that the agency\u2019s \u201cpreliminary choices (such \nas its use of the four-step framework for the Good \nNeighbor Provision)\u201d mean the action was \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d because \n\u201cthose choices did not \u2018end[]\u2019 the \u2018controversy\u2019: whether \nthe EPA should approve Kentucky\u2019s plan.\u201d Id.  at *12. \n\u201cInstead, the \u2018determination\u2019 underlying the EPA\u2019s \ndisapproval was its ultimate decision that Kentucky \ndid not satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision.\u201d Id. \nMeanwhile, the Eighth Circuit denied EPA\u2019s \nmotions to transfer challenges to the disapprovals of \nArkansas\u2019s, Missouri\u2019s, and Minnesota\u2019s plans in a \nseries of summary orders. E.g., Order, Arkansas v. \nEPA, No. 23-1320, Dkt. No. 5269098 (8th Cir. April 25, \n2023). Motions panels in the Ninth and Eleventh \nCircuits have deferred decision on EPA\u2019s motions to \ntransfer to a later merits panel in challenges to the \nstate plan disapprovals of Nevada and Alabama. \nOrder, Nevada Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, Dkt. \n\n15 \n \nNo. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Alabama v. EPA, \nNo. 23-11173, Dkt. No. 24 (11th Cir. July 12, 2023). So \ntoo did the Tenth Circuit motions panel. Order, Utah \nv. EPA, No. 23-9509, Dkt. No. 10994985 (10th Cir. \nApril 27, 2023). \nBut the merits panel of the Tenth Circuit held \nthat EPA\u2019s disapprovals of the Utah and Oklahoma \nstate plans were \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and ordered \nthe cases transferred to the D.C. Circuit. Pet.App.12a-\n19a. The Tenth Circuit justified this conclusion by \nstating: \u201cPetitioners seek review of a final rule \ndisapproving [state plans] from 21 states across the \ncountry\u2014spanning eight EPA regions and ten federal \njudicial circuits\u2014because those states all failed to \ncomply \nwith \nthe \ngood-neighbor \nprovision.\u201d \nPet.App.12a. \u201cAnd,\u201d the Tenth Circuit continued, \u201cin \npromulgating that rule, the EPA applied a uniform \nstatutory interpretation and common analytical \nmethods, which required the agency to examine the \noverlapping and interwoven linkages between upwind \nand downwind states in a consistent manner.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 12a-13a. In a footnote, the Tenth Circuit declined \nto \u201caddress EPA\u2019s alternative argument that the \npetitions belong in the D.C. Circuit\u201d because they \nchallenge actions \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d Pet.App.19a n.8.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The proper venue for Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nchallenges to EPA\u2019s disapproval of their state plans is \nthe Tenth Circuit.  \nA.1. Section 7607(a)(1) designates venue based on \nthe statutory authority EPA exercised in taking the \n\n16 \n \naction being challenged. Oklahoma and Utah \nseparately challenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of their \nindividual state plans under Section 7410 of the Act. \nThe question is thus whether those actions were \nnationally applicable, reviewable in the D.C. Circuit, \nor locally or regionally applicable actions, reviewable \nin the Tenth Circuit.  \n2. The text of Section 7410 establishes that EPA\u2019s \ndisapproval of state implementation plans is a locally \nor regionally applicable action. That provision \nexclusively refers to State and EPA action on a state \nimplementation plan in the singular. Section 7410 \nrequires \u201ceach State\u201d to develop a \u201cplan\u201d to govern \nemissions. EPA must then act \u201con each plan.\u201d EPA\u2019s \naction on a state plan is thus a \u201cprototypical \u2018locally or \nregionally \napplicable\u2019 \naction\u201d \nunder \nSection \n7607(b)(1). Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n, 705 \nF.3d at 455. \n3. The text of Section 7607(b)(1) dispels any \nremaining doubt about the actions at issue. Congress \nidentified \n\u201cany \ndenial \nor \ndisapproval\u201d \nunder \nsubchapter I\u2014which includes Section 7410\u2014as an \nexample of locally or regionally applicable actions.  \nThis is further supported by Congress\u2019s decision \nin Section 7607(b)(1) to list state plan approvals as \nreviewable in the regional circuit. EPA exercises the \nsame statutory authority\u2014and conducts the same \nanalysis\u2014whether it approves or disapproves a state \nplan. Because state plan disapprovals require EPA to \napply the same state-specific review as required by the \nstatute, disapprovals are locally or regionally \napplicable too. Indeed, EPA has admitted its state \n\n17 \n \nplan approvals are locally or regionally applicable. Its \ninsistence \nthat \ndisapprovals \nare \ndifferent \nis \nincoherent. \nB. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s contrary holding does not \nwithstand scrutiny. \n1. The Tenth Circuit relied primarily on the belief \nthat the \u201caction\u201d being challenged was the notice \nsimultaneously announcing the disapproval of 21 \nstate plans. But EPA\u2019s chosen format for publishing \nits disapprovals is different than the substantive \nactions EPA actually took. Section 7607(b)(1) itself \ndistinguishes between the action being challenged\u2014\napproval or disapproval of individual state plans\u2014and \nEPA\u2019s notice of that action. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s rule \nwould give EPA power to manipulate venue by \ntransforming \nentirely \nunrelated \n(and \nlocally \napplicable actions) into a single, nationally applicable \naction by issuing a combined Federal Register notice.  \n2. EPA\u2019s application of uniform statutory \ninterpretation and common analytical methods does \nnot matter either. EPA must apply consistent \ninterpretations and methods, lest its decisionmaking \nbe arbitrary and capricious. EPA thus correctly \nadmitted at the certiorari stage that use of a national \nstandard is not sufficient to render an action \nnationally applicable. After all, EPA applied the exact \nsame principles and methodologies to its state plan \napprovals, which it admits were locally applicable. \nAnd EPA\u2019s state plan disapprovals considered and \nrejected state-specific reasoning within each State\u2019s \nplan.  \n\n18 \n \nRegardless, the Section 7607(b)(1) \u201capplicability\u201d \nanalysis should not require a detailed inquiry into \nEPA\u2019s reasoning. Courts have repeatedly rejected an \ninterpretation of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s applicability \ninquiry that considers an action\u2019s \u201cpractical effects\u201d or \nanything other than the substantive statutory \nauthority EPA was exercising.  \n3. The Tenth Circuit further held that no action is \ncategorically reviewable in the regional circuits, even \nactions Congress specifically listed as so reviewable. \nRather, the court held that petitioners must always \nprove the action was locally or regionally applicable.  \nThat interpretation renders the list of specifically \nenumerated examples in Section 7607(b)(1) entirely \nsuperfluous. It also ignores that the statute originally \ndid not include a catchall. The prior version of the Act \nsimply listed actions and identified the correct venue \nfor each. When Congress added the catchall, it \nnecessarily expanded the number of actions subject to \nchallenge in the regional circuits. Finally, under the \nlast-antecedent canon, the phrase \u201cwhich is locally or \nregionally applicable\u201d modifies \u201cany other action,\u201d not \nthe enumerated entries in the list.  \nII. EPA\u2019s reliance on Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s narrow \nexception\u2014claiming that the challenges must be filed \nin the D.C. Circuit because the challenged actions are \n\u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect\u201d\u2014fails, too.  \nA. That exception requires EPA to first publish a \nfinding that the action was \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect\u201d and then for courts to \nindependently review the \u201cdetermination\u201d on which \n\n19 \n \nEPA \u201cbased\u201d its action\u2014that is, the core or ultimate \nreason why EPA took the action it did. Once the court \nhas assessed the \u201cdetermination\u201d the action was \n\u201cbased on,\u201d it must decide whether that determination \nhas nationwide scope or effect. A determination has \nnationwide scope if it covers the entire country and \nnationwide effect if it produces consequences across \nthe whole country. But if EPA\u2019s action was \u201cbased on\u201d \na determination specific to a State, the exception does \nnot apply. \nB.1 \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapprovals \nwere \nbased \non \ndeterminations specific to each State. State plans rely \non \nintensely \nfactual, \nstate-specific \nanalysis. \nOklahoma\u2019s plan, for instance, analyzed state-specific \nprojections of future ozone emissions using region-\nspecific modeling. Utah\u2019s plan likewise analyzed \nemissions projections for specific sources within and \nnear Utah based on state- and region-specific factors.  \nEPA rejected Oklahoma\u2019s use of region-specific \nmodeling and concluded that Oklahoma had not \ncorrectly analyzed its projected contributions to \ndownwind States. EPA likewise concluded that Utah \nhad inadequately analyzed its projected contributions \nto nearby States because its analysis had \u201ctechnical \nand \nlegal \nflaws.\u201d \nThese \nare \nplainly \nlocal \ndeterminations. And EPA\u2019s analysis of other state \nplans, whether it approved or disapproved them, was \nsimilarly state-specific.  \n2. EPA\u2019s contrary arguments fail. EPA principally \nargues that it used a nationally consistent, 4-step \nframework for analyzing state plans. But although \nthat framework organized EPA\u2019s analysis, it did not \n\n20 \n \nconstitute the ultimate justification for its judgment \non the merits of the underlying state plans. Indeed, \nEPA also used this 4-step framework when approving \nstate plans. EPA\u2019s ultimate reasons for approving or \ndisapproving a particular plan were thus \u201cbased on\u201d \nstate-specific circumstances, not this 4-step analytical \nframework.  \nSame \nwith \nEPA\u2019s \nreliance \non \nnationwide \nemissions modeling. EPA\u2019s core reasons for approving \nor disapproving a state plan turned on whether that \nState \nwould \nsignificantly \ncontribute \nozone \nto \ndownwind States, not what modeling it used. Indeed, \nEPA was adamant that neither its 4-step framework \nnor its nationwide modeling bound either the States \nor EPA.  \nEPA also sought to avoid inconsistent results \nwhen reviewing state plans. But that is a basic \nrequirement of agency rulemaking. EPA\u2019s general \npreference for treating similarly situated States alike \ndoes not constitute the core reasons why EPA \napproved or disapproved a given state plan.   \n3. Finally, EPA argued that challenges to its state \nplan disapprovals should be filed in the D.C. Circuit to \neliminate potentially inconsistent judicial opinions. \nBut this desire for uniformity is not a \u201cdetermination\u201d \non which EPA\u2019s underlying action was based. And, in \nany case, Section 7607(b)(1) is designed to allow \ndifferent circuits to analyze distinct state plan actions.  \n\n21 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe proper venue for a challenge to the \ndisapproval of a state implementation plan \nis the regional circuit. \nThe venue analysis is straightforward. Under \nSection 7607(b)(1), venue depends on the type of EPA \naction being challenged, defined by reference to the \nstatutory authority EPA exercises. Petitioners are \nchallenging EPA\u2019s disapprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and \nUtah\u2019s implementation plans under Section 7410. \nThat provision grants States the authority to prepare \nand EPA the authority to approve or disapprove \nindividual state plans. Indeed, Congress expressly \nidentified state implementation plan approvals and \ndisapprovals in the regional circuit review provision. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). There can thus be little doubt that state \nplan disapprovals are locally applicable actions.  \nIn \nruling \notherwise, \nthe \nTenth \nCircuit \nmisinterpreted the statute. Venue under Section \n7607(b)(1) does not turn on whether EPA chose to \npublish several separate actions in a single notice\u2014\nthat confuses the substance of the statutory authority \nEPA exercised with the form of publication. Nor does \nit depend on whether EPA relied on uniform statutory \ninterpretation and common analytical methods\u2014that \nis true of nearly every lawful agency action. And the \nTenth Circuit\u2019s further suggestion that no action, even \nthose specifically listed in Section 7607(b)(1), is \ncategorically reviewable in the regional circuits is \ninconsistent with the text.  \n\n22 \n \nA. Under the Act\u2019s plain text, EPA action on \nstate plans is reviewable in the regional \ncircuits.  \n1. Venue under Section 7607(b)(1) turns on the \nEPA \u201caction\u201d being challenged. Section 7607(b)(1) \n\u201cspecifically enumerate[s]\u201d EPA actions subject to \njudicial review, itemizing actions that are reviewable \nin the D.C. Circuit and ones that are reviewable in the \nregional circuits. Harrison, 446 U.S. at 579, 584. \nThose lists make clear the relevant \u201caction\u201d is defined \nby the statutory authority under which EPA acts. See \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). For example, an action promulgating \n\u201cany emission standard or requirement under section \n7412 of this title\u201d is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit, \nwhile an \u201caction in approving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan under section 7410 of this title\u201d \nis reviewable in the regional circuit. Id.; see also \nKentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at *8 (agreeing that \u201cthe \nphrase \u2018final action\u2019 adopts a \u2018statutory approach\u2019\u201d \nbecause \u201c[t]he provision ties the proper tribunal to the \nactivity taken \u2018under this chapter\u2019\u201d).   \nSection \n7607(b)(1) \nthen \nprovides \n\u201ccatchall\u201d \nprovisions for challenges to EPA actions not \nspecifically enumerated. See Harrison, 446 U.S. at \n579, 584, 587. \u201c[A]ny other nationally applicable\u201d \naction is reviewed in the D.C. Circuit and \u201cany other \nfinal action of the Administrator under this chapter \n(including \nany \ndenial \nor \ndisapproval \nby \nthe \nAdministrator under subchapter I) which is locally or \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewed in the regional \ncircuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \n\n23 \n \nHere, \nPetitioners \nare \nchallenging \nEPA\u2019s \ndisapprovals \nof \nOklahoma\u2019s \nand \nUtah\u2019s \nimplementation plans, actions EPA took under \nSection 7410 of Title 42, which is codified in \nsubchapter \nI. \nThe \nquestion \nis \nthus \nwhether \ndisapprovals under Section 7410 are reviewable in the \nregional circuit. \n2. \nSection \n7410 \nmakes \nclear \nEPA\u2019s \nimplementation plan decisions\u2014the actions at issue\u2014 \nare locally or regionally applicable. Section 7410(a)(1) \nrequires \u201c[e]ach State\u201d to develop \u201ca plan\u201d to govern \nemissions \u201cwithin such State.\u201d Section 7410(a)(2) then \nrequires \n\u201c[e]ach \nimplementation \nplan\u201d \nto \nbe \n\u201csubmitted by a State.\u201d Section 7410(k) next mandates \nEPA to \u201cact[] on each plan,\u201d always referring to \u201c\u2018plan\u2019 \nin the singular.\u201d West Virginia, 90 F.4th at 330 (citing \n\u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3)). That requires EPA to determine \nwhether \u201cthe plan\u201d is complete, \u00a7 7410(k)(1)(B), and to \n\u201capprove\u201d \u201ca plan\u201d if it meets the statutory \nrequirements, \u00a7 7410(k)(2)-(3). And under Section \n7410(c), if EPA \u201cdisapproves a State implementation \nplan,\u201d it may promulgate \u201ca Federal implementation \nplan,\u201d unless \u201cthe State corrects the deficiency\u201d in its \nstate plan first. Section 7410 accordingly \u201crequires the \nEPA to \u2018act\u2019 on each State\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-by-\nplan basis.\u201d Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at *9. \nEPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of a state plan \nunder Section 7410 thus applies only to a \u201csingle \nstate.\u201d Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 386 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting Sierra Club v. EPA, 926 F.3d \n844, 849 (D.C. Cir. 2019)). Because a state plan applies \nonly to a single State, the \u201cdenial and legal impact\u201d of \n\n24 \n \nthe disapproval of a state plan \u201caffects only [that \nState]\u2014that is, it does not concern the nation, let \nalone any other state.\u201d Kentucky, 2023 WL 11871967, \nat *2. \nEPA is also required to review each state plan \nseparately and on its own terms. States have the \n\u201cprimary responsibility for assuring air quality.\u201d \n\u00a7 7407(a). EPA\u2019s individualized review is necessary \nbecause the statute gives each State \u201cwide discretion \nin formulating its plan.\u201d Union Elec. Co., 427 U.S. at \n250. That regulatory discretion\u2014and the \u201cintensely \nfactual determinations\u201d about the \u201cparticularities of \nthe emissions sources\u201d in the State and other local \nconditions on which state plans are based\u2014means \nthat state plans differ markedly from one another. \nTexas, 829 F.3d at 421. That is the point of state plans. \nCongress delegated this regulatory authority to \nStates, rather than authorizing EPA to establish a \nuniform, nationally applicable plan, because States \nare \u201cbest positioned to adjust for local differences.\u201d \nAlaska Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Conservation, 540 U.S. at 488. \nThe inherently state-specific nature of the state \nplan preparation and review process is why EPA\u2019s \napproval of state plans is a \u201cprototypical \u2018locally or \nregionally applicable\u2019 action\u201d for venue purposes. Am. \nRd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n, 705 F.3d at 455; see also \nSierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 744 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(a state plan \u201cby nature concerns a particular state\u201d); \nNat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. McCarthy, 816 F.3d \n989, 993 (8th Cir. 2016) (same); ATK Launch Sys., Inc. \nv. EPA, 651 F.3d 1194, 1199 (10th Cir. 2011) \n(describing action on state plans as both \u201cpurely local \n\n25 \n \naction\u201d and \u201cundisputably regional\u201d); Texas Mun. \nPower Agency v. EPA, 89 F.3d 858, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(same). \nContext provides confirmation. The actions listed \nby Section 7607(b)(1) as reviewable only in the D.C. \nCircuit look nothing like a state plan disapproval \nunder Section 7410. Each of those actions points to \nstatutory provisions that grant EPA power to \npromulgate generally applicable \u201cstandards\u201d or \n\u201crequirements\u201d applying uniformly to the whole \ncountry. See supra 6. When EPA promulgates \u201cany \nnational primary or secondary ambient air quality \nstandard,\u201d \nnational \nemissions \nstandards \nfor \nhazardous pollutants under Section 7412, standards \nof performance for all new sources under Section 7411, \nor new emissions standards for all motor vehicles \nunder Section 7521, those must be challenged in the \nD.C. Circuit. See \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Under the \u201c\u2018ejusdem \ngeneris\u2019 canon,\u201d which \u201cinstructs courts to interpret \nthe catchall as falling within the same class as the \nspecific items that precede it,\u201d the nationally \napplicable catchall cannot apply to the disapprovals of \nstate implementation plans, which unlike the setting \nof national standards are not national. Kentucky, 2024 \nWL 5001991, at *7 (citing Bissonnette v. LePage \nBakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 (2024)). \nBy \ncontrast, \nthe \nimplementation \nplan \ndisapprovals challenged here are closely akin to \nactions the statute designates for review in regional \ncircuit. The regional circuit provision references, for \nexample, Sections 7411(j), 7419 and 7420, each of \nwhich authorize EPA to take action directed towards \n\n26 \n \na specific source. See \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see also W. Virginia \nChamber of Com. v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336, 1998 WL \n827315, at *6 (4th Cir. 1998) (unpublished) (\u201c[C]ertain \ntypes of actions are clearly regionally applicable, for \ninstance, when the EPA brings an enforcement action \nagainst or makes a determination with respect to a \nparticular facility.\u201d). Most tellingly, Section 7607 \nspecifically enumerates \u201cpetition[s] for review of the \nAdministrator\u2019s action in approving or promulgating \nany implementation plan under section 7410 of this \ntitle\u201d\u2014plans like the ones Oklahoma and Utah \nsubmitted here\u2014as reviewable in the regional circuit. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). This context thus reinforces what is \nalready clear from the text: any implementation plan \ndisapproval under Section 7410 is a locally or \nregionally applicable action. \n3. If any doubt remained, disapprovals of state \nplans are reviewable in the regional circuit because \nCongress identified them as locally or regionally \napplicable actions. Congress inserted within the \nlocally \nor \nregionally \napplicable \ncatchall \nthe \nparenthetical phrase \u201c(including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter \nI).\u201d That is what we have here: EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s implementation plans using \nits authority under Section 7410, which is codified in \nsubchapter I of the Act. \nAn interpretation that state plan denials or \ndisapprovals are nationally applicable actions would \nrender superfluous Congress\u2019s decision to specifically \nmention denials or disapprovals in the parenthetical. \nMilner v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 575 (2011) \n\n27 \n \n(\u201c[S]tatutes should be read to avoid making any \nprovision \u2018superfluous, void, or insignificant\u2019\u201d (citation \nomitted)). Recall: when Congress first added the \ncatchall, it read \u201cor any other final action of the \nAdministrator under this chapter which is locally or \nregionally applicable.\u201d See Pub. L. 95-95 (Aug. 7, \n1977). If Congress thought denials or disapprovals are \nsometimes nationally applicable, that language would \nhave been sufficient. But Congress amended the \ncatchall to clarify that it \u201cinclud[es] any denial or \ndisapproval\u201d under subchapter I. Pub. L. 95-190 (Nov. \n16, 1977). \u201cWhen \u2018Congress acts to amend a statute, \nwe presume it intends its amendment to have real and \nsubstantial effect.\u2019\u201d Husky Int\u2019l Elecs., Inc. v. Ritz, 578 \nU.S. 355, 359 (2016). Here, the real and substantial \neffect of adding the parenthetical was to expand the \nactions expressly subject to the regional review \nprovision. See Harrison, 446 U.S. at 585.  \nMoreover, Congress enumerated \u201capprov[als]\u201d of \n\u201cany implementation plan under section 7410\u201d as \ncategorically reviewable in the regional circuits, so it \nwould make little sense to think that disapprovals of \nthe same implementation plans should be litigated in \na different venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). After all, the scope of \nthat catchall is \u201ccontrolled and defined by reference\u201d \nto the specific examples \u201cthat precede it.\u201d Sw. Airlines \nCo. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450, 458 (2022) (citation \nomitted). So where EPA\u2019s \u201cdenial or disapproval\u201d is \nmade under the same statutory authority as the \nenumerated actions categorically reviewable in the \nregional courts of appeals, the action is necessarily \nlocally or regionally applicable. Section 7410 governs \n\n28 \n \nboth approvals and disapprovals of implementation \nplans and there is no legal distinction between state \nplan disapproval and state plan approval actions. \nBecause state plan approvals under Section 7410 are \nalways reviewable in the regional circuit, state plan \ndisapprovals under that Section must be, too. \nEPA conceded that its state plan approvals \nimplementing the same 2015 NAAQS were reviewable \nlocally. It instructed that \u201cpetitions for judicial review \n\u2026 must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the appropriate circuit.\u201d See, e.g., 85 Fed. Reg. \n20,165, 20,177 (Apr. 10, 2020) (Colorado and North \nDakota); 86 Fed. Reg. 68,413, 68,420 (Dec. 2, 2021) \n(Florida, \nGeorgia, \nNorth \nCarolina, \nand \nSouth \nCarolina). That view mirrors how EPA (and courts) \nhave treated state plan decisions historically. See, e.g., \nComm. for a Better Arvin v. EPA, 786 F.3d 1169, 1174 \n(9th Cir. 2015) (reviewing challenge to approval of \nCalifornia\u2019s implementation plan); Alabama Env\u2019t \nCouncil v. EPA, 711 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir. 2013) \n(reviewing challenges to approval and subsequent \ndisapproval of revisions to Alabama\u2019s implementation \nplan); Ass\u2019n of Irritated Residents v. EPA, 686 F.3d \n668, 671 (9th Cir. 2012) (reviewing challenge to partial \napproval of revisions to California\u2019s implementation \nplan); BCCA Appeal Grp. v. EPA, 355 F.3d 817, 821 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (reviewing challenge to approval of \nTexas\u2019s implementation plan). EPA\u2019s opposite position \nfor state plan disapprovals makes no sense. \nIn sum, the text and context of Section 7607(b)(1) \nconfirms that EPA\u2019s actions disapproving Oklahoma\u2019s \nand Utah\u2019s state implementation plans were locally or \n\n29 \n \nregionally applicable actions reviewable in the \nregional circuit court. Venue for these cases \naccordingly lies in the Tenth Circuit. \nB. The \nTenth \nCircuit \nmisinterpreted \nSection 7607(b)(1). \nDespite the Act\u2019s plain text, the Tenth Circuit \nruled that because EPA published its disapprovals of \ntwenty-one state plans in a single Federal Register \nnotice and applied a uniform statutory interpretation \nand common analytical methods, Oklahoma\u2019s and \nUtah\u2019s challenges may be filed only in the D.C. Circuit. \nThat reasoning does not withstand scrutiny. \n1. The Tenth Circuit rested primarily on the \nmistaken assumption that \u201cthe final EPA action being \nchallenged\u201d was \u201ca final rule disapproving [state \nplans] \nfrom \n21 \nstates \nacross \nthe \ncountry.\u201d \nPet.App.12a. But that reasoning conflates EPA\u2019s \ndecision about how to publish rulemakings with the \nunderlying substantive action EPA took. Under \nSection 7607(b)(1), \u201cvenue depends entirely on\u2014and is \nfixed by\u2014the nature of the agency\u2019s action.\u201d S. Ill. \nPower Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, 670 (7th Cir. 2017). \nThe relevant \u201caction\u201d here is thus EPA\u2019s disapproval \nof individual state plans under Section 7410. See \nsupra 22-23.  \nThe Tenth Circuit literally elevated form over \nsubstance. Its focus on the form of publication \ncontradicts \nSection 7607(b)(1), which \nspecifically \ndistinguishes between the \u201caction\u201d being challenged \nand EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 action \u2026 in the Federal \nRegister.\u201d (emphasis added). But \u201cthe label that the \nparticular agency puts upon its given exercise of \n\n30 \n \nadministrative power\u201d should not matter. Lewis-Mota \nv. Sec\u2019y of Lab., 469 F.2d 478, 481 (2d Cir. 1972) \n(citation omitted)). \u201c[R]ather it is what the agency does \nin fact\u201d that should control. Id. at 482; see also Brown \nExpress, Inc. v. United States, 607 F.2d 695, 700 (5th \nCir. 1979) (holding \u201cfrivolous\u201d the argument that the \nagency\u2019s decision to label its action a \u201cNotice of \nElimination\u201d meant it was not a substantive rule \nsubject to notice and comment requirements). This \ndistinction \u201cbetween the publication of a document \nand its issuance, prescription, or promulgation\u201d is \nwell-established. Humane Soc\u2019y of the U.S. v. U.S. \nDep\u2019t of Agric., 41 F.4th 564, 569 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  \nMoreover, if venue turned on whether EPA chose \nto package multiple disapprovals in a single Federal \nRegister notice, EPA would have unfettered power to \nensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d \nTravis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) \n(citation omitted). After all, agencies have discretion \nto issue \u201comnibus\u201d notices that combine many \ndifferent rules into a single Federal Register \ndocument. See Reeder v. FCC, 865 F.2d 1298, 1300 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (\u201cNormally, new FM channels are \nallotted \nin \nindividual \nrulemaking \nproceedings; \nhowever, in this case the Commission decided to \nallocate all of the new channels pursuant to a single \nnationwide omnibus rulemaking.\u201d); 78 Fed. Reg. 5,666 \n(Jan. 25, 2013) (combining four final rules arising \nunder different statutory authority into an \u201comnibus \nfinal rule\u201d). \nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s rule would thus enable \n\u201cgamesmanship\u201d by EPA. Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 \n\n31 \n \nU.S. 77, 94 (2010). The agency could, for example, \nmanipulate venue by combining two locally applicable \nbut \nentirely \nunrelated \nactions \nunder \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2014like the approval of Oklahoma\u2019s \nstate plan under Section 7410 and an \u201corder\u201d related \nto a specific \u201cnonferrous smelter\u201d in Ohio under \nSection 7419. Section 7607(b)(1) expressly lists both \nactions as categorically reviewable in the regional \ncircuit. If published separately, each would be \nchallengeable in the appropriate regional circuit. But, \nunder the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning, if EPA published \nthem in the same Federal Register notice, they would \nbe nationally applicable and reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit. See also Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at \n*8 (\u201cNothing in \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s text would allow the \nEPA to obtain D.C. Circuit review of the smelter order \nsimply \nby \ncombining \nit \nwith \nthe \nair-quality \nstandard.\u201d). \nTake, as another particularly egregious example, \nEPA\u2019s contradictory venue determinations for the \nstate plans submitted by Iowa and Kansas. EPA \ninitially approved both state plans. When doing so, \nEPA admitted the approvals were locally applicable. \nSee 87 Fed. Reg. at 22,463; 87 Fed. Reg. at 19,391. Two \nyears later, EPA proposed to disapprove the same \nstate plans for Iowa and Kansas but this time did so \nin a single Federal Register notice along with three \nother States. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 12,668, 12,695. EPA \nthen \nasserted \nthat \nthe \ndisapprovals \n(and \nsimultaneous \npromulgation \nof \na \nfederal \nimplementation plan) were \u201cnationally applicable.\u201d Id. \nat 12,725. There is simply no principled basis to treat \n\n32 \n \nthese state plan approvals as locally applicable but \ntreat disapprovals of the same states differently. And \nwhen EPA partially disapproves and partially \napproves a state plan, it likewise recognizes that is a \nlocally applicable action. See 89 Fed. Reg. 95,117, \n95,120 (Dec. 2, 2024). This further confirms that EPA\u2019s \npurported \ndistinction \nbetween \napprovals \nand \ndisapprovals is arbitrary. \n2. The Tenth Circuit also pointed to EPA\u2019s \napplication of \u201ca uniform statutory interpretation and \ncommon analytical methods.\u201d Pet.App.12a-13a. But \nSection 7607(b)(1) \nsays \nnothing \nabout \nEPA\u2019s \nreasoning or analysis. Again, the venue provision is \nfocused on the statutory authority under which EPA \ntook the challenged action. \nNor could venue under Section 7607(b)(1) turn on \nwhether EPA used a uniform statutory interpretation \nor common analytical methods across otherwise \nlocally \napplicable \nactions. \nEvery \nEPA \naction \n\u201cpurportedly applies a national standard created by \nthe national statute and its national regulations.\u201d \nWest Virginia, 90 F.4th at 329-30; see also Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc., 45 F.4th at 387 (explaining that all \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may require \ninterpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory terms\u201d). \n\u201cWere that the appropriate consideration, there could \nbe no local or regional action.\u201d West Virginia, 90 F.4th \nat 328.  \nIndeed, if EPA applied different standards or \ninterpretations to similarly situated States, that may \ncreate \u201cinconsistency\u201d that would be \u201carbitrary and \ncapricious.\u201d Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 \n\n33 \n \nU.S. 211, 222 (2016) (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). A locally applicable action therefore \ndoes not become national simply because it \u201capplies a \nbroad regulation to a specific context and \u2026 may set a \nprecedent for future [state implementation plan] \nproceedings.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n, 705 \nF.3d at 456. And because Congress provided an \nexception whereby locally applicable actions are \nreviewed in the D.C. Circuit if \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope and effect,\u201d EPA\u2019s \ninvocation of nationwide standards in the applicability \ninquiry \u201cwould unravel this layered scheme\u201d by \nrequiring courts to \u201clook[] to an action\u2019s justification at \nthe start to decide whether the action is national or \nlocal.\u201d Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at *10. \nEPA\u2019s actions on the state plans below confirms \nits application of common standards does not render \nthose actions nationally applicable. EPA applied the \nsame legal principles and methodology to both the \nstate plan approvals and the disapprovals. Compare \n87 Fed. Reg. at 9,480 (explaining in its proposed \napproval of Iowa\u2019s state plan that \u201cEPA proposes to \napply a consistent set of policy judgments across all \nstates for purposes of evaluating \u2026 the approvability \nof\u201d state plans), with 87 Fed. Reg. at 9,801 (same \nlanguage in the proposed disapprovals for Arkansas, \nLouisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas state plans). But \nEPA conceded that each state plan approval was a \nlocally or regionally applicable action. See supra 9. \nApplying the same statutory interpretation and \nmethodology in the state plan disapprovals therefore \ncannot \njustify \ntreating \nthose \ndisapprovals \nas \n\n34 \n \nnationally applicable. And, in fact, EPA admitted at \nthe certiorari stage that \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national \nstandard\u201d is not sufficient to render an action \nnationally applicable. Cert. Resp. 16-17. \nThe contents of the state plans that EPA \ndisapproved here also confirm their local applicability. \nEach State submitted a separate plan. Supra 7-9.  The \nplans differed in significant ways. Most importantly, \neach focused on the emissions sources within the State \nand how, if at all, they contributed to a handful of \nother States. Those state-specific evaluations also \ndiffered in mode of analysis. For instance, Texas \nconducted its own air-quality modeling, rather than \nrelying on EPA\u2019s nationwide modeling. Oklahoma \nrelied on Texas\u2019s region-specific modeling. J.A.13a-\n14a. Oklahoma likewise conducted a source- and \nOklahoma-specific weight-of-the-evidence analysis of \nits future emissions. J.A.21a-26a. And while Utah \nused EPA\u2019s modeling, Utah applied a weight-of-\nevidence approach to assess contributions to Colorado \nor other downwind States. J.A.42a-57a. \nEPA\u2019s review of the state plans was also locally \nand regionally focused. The proposed disapprovals \nwere reviewed by EPA\u2019s regional offices and signed by \nregional EPA administrators. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. at \n9,835. Many proposed disapprovals covered only a \nsingle State. Supra 9. When EPA combined several \nproposed disapprovals in a single proposed action, it \ngrouped the state plans by EPA region. Supra 9-10. In \nthe proposed and final rulemakings, EPA evaluated \n\u201cthe \ncontents \nof \neach \nindividual \nstate\u2019s \nsubmission \u2026 on their own merits\u201d and in separate \n\n35 \n \nsubsections. 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,354-61; see also 87 Fed. \nReg. at 9,816-24 (discussing Oklahoma\u2019s plan \nseparately from Louisiana\u2019s, Arkansas\u2019s, or Texas\u2019s \nplans). EPA considered and rejected the state-specific \nreasoning within each State\u2019s plan. For instance, EPA \nrejected \nOklahoma\u2019s \nalternative \napproach \nto \ncalculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d was likely \nto struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,359. EPA likewise rejected \nUtah\u2019s arguments about why \u201ccertain receptors in \nColorado should not be counted as receptors\u201d as \n\u201cinsufficient\u201d and found \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in \nthe State\u2019s arguments related to relative contribution, \ninternational and non-anthropogenic emissions, and \nthe relationship of upwind versus downwind-state \nresponsibilities.\u201d Id. at 9,360. Finally, EPA codified \neach state plan disapproval in separate subparts of the \nCode of Federal Regulations. Id. at 9,381-84.   \nRegardless, \ndetermining \nwhere \nan \naction \n\u201capplies\u201d ought not require this kind of detailed \ninquiry. \nCourts \nhave \nrepeatedly \nrejected \nan \ninterpretation of Section 7607(b)(1) that turns on the \naction\u2019s \u201cpractical effects,\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. \nBuilders Ass\u2019n, 705 F.3d at 456, rather than its \u201clegal \neffect,\u201d Calumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 \nF.4th 1121, 1131 (5th Cir. 2023). That is in part \nbecause a focus on the \u201cde facto scope of the \nregulation\u201d raises \u201ccomplex factual and line-drawing \nproblems.\u201d Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Thomas, 838 \nF.2d 1224, 1249 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Section 7607(b)(1) \nrequires courts to \u201canalyz[e] the nature of EPA\u2019s \naction,\u201d instead of the practical effects of the \n\n36 \n \nrulemaking or the \u201cspecifics of the petitioner\u2019s \ngrievance.\u201d RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, \n1372 (11th Cir. 2023). Under the text of Section 7607, \nthe nature of EPA\u2019s action is governed by the statutory \nprovision under which EPA is exercising authority, \nnot by the contents of the preamble EPA published in \ntaking that action. \nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s rule requiring courts to \nscrutinize the particularities of EPA\u2019s analysis, rather \nthan merely identify the statutory authority being \nexercised, produces the same \u201ccomplex factual and \nline-drawing problems\u201d as other rejected methods of \napplying Section 7607. Thomas, 838 F.2d at 1249. \nEPA rulemakings can be immensely technical. A \nrequirement for courts to analyze at the threshold of \nevery case whether EPA\u2019s reasoning across several \nactions was \u201cuniform\u201d or applied \u201cin a consistent \nmanner\u201d \nwill \nsquander \njudicial \nresources. \nPet.App.12a-13a. Nor does the Tenth Circuit\u2019s rule \nclarify the extent to which EPA\u2019s reasoning must be \nbased on uniform statutory interpretation and \ncommon analytical methods. EPA has never argued \nthat its state plan disapprovals were entirely based on \ncommon reasoning. See supra 10-11 (noting EPA\u2019s \nanalysis \nof \nstate-specific \nreasoning \nin \nits \ndisapprovals). If any reliance on uniform statutory \ninterpretation is enough, no EPA action would be \nlocally applicable. But neither the Tenth Circuit nor \nEPA identified where to draw that line. And because \nvenue for most challenges will be determined by the \nchallenged action\u2019s applicability, the Tenth Circuit\u2019s \n\n37 \n \ninterpretation would greatly complicate most venue \ndeterminations under Section 7607(b)(1).  \n3. The Tenth Circuit also implicitly held that no \nEPA action is categorically reviewable in the regional \ncircuits even if specifically enumerated in Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s list of actions reviewable in the regional \ncircuits. Rather, focusing on the catchall phrase \u201cany \nother final action \u2026 which is locally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d the Tenth Circuit reasoned in a footnote \nthat petitioners challenging enumerated examples of \nactions reviewable in the regional circuit must prove \nthe \u201capproval, promulgation, denial, or disapproval is \nlocally or regionally applicable.\u201d Pet.App.11a-12a n.5 \n(emphasis added). It thus rendered meaningless the \nstatute\u2019s specific reference to implementation plan \napprovals and disapprovals, which is a strong, if not \ndefinitive, indication that the actions challenged here \nare locally or regionally applicable. See supra 26-28. \nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s reading violates bedrock \nprinciples of statutory interpretation. For one, the \nTenth \nCircuit\u2019s \nview \nrenders \nthe \nenumerated \nexamples in Section 7607(b)(1) superfluous.  \nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s interpretation also conflicts \nwith how Congress amended the statute. The 1970 \nversion of the statute did not include the phrase \n\u201cwhich is locally or regionally applicable.\u201d Rather, \nCongress simply designated the venue for certain \nchallenges\u2014including EPA\u2019s \u201caction in approving or \npromulgating any implementation plan under section \n110\u201d\u2014in the \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d rather than the D.C. \nCircuit. See Pub. L. 91-604 (Dec. 31, 1970). The venue \nanalysis under the 1970 version of the statute thus \n\n38 \n \nturned solely on whether the action under review was \nlisted in Section 7607(b)(1). The addition of a catchall \nin the August 1977 amendment did not narrow the \nscope of the existing categorical provisions. Congress \ninstead expanded the ambit of Section 7607(b)(1) by \n\u201cadd[ing] to the list of locally or regionally applicable \nactions\u201d the catchall. Harrison, 446 U.S. at 584.  \nThe \nlast-antecedent \ncanon \nconfirms \nthis \ninterpretation. Under that canon, \u201ca limiting clause or \nphrase\u201d should \u201cordinarily be read as modifying only \nthe noun or phrase that it immediately follows,\u201d \nabsent \u201cother indicia of meaning\u201d overriding that \npresumption. Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 \n(2003). Here, the phrase \u201cwhich is locally or regionally \napplicable\u201d modifies \u201cor any other final action of\u201d EPA. \nThat interpretation \u201creflects the basic intuition that \nwhen a modifier appears at the end of a list,\u201d it applies \n\u201conly to the item directly before it.\u201d Lockhart v. United \nStates, 577 U.S. 347, 351 (2016). That is doubly true \nwhere applying the modifier to the rest of the list \nwould \nrun \n\u201cheadlong \ninto \nthe \nrule \nagainst \nsuperfluity.\u201d Id. at 356.  \n  \n \n* \n* \n* \nUltimately, the Section 7607(b)(1) venue analysis \nshould not, and does not, turn on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s \narbitrary and atextual distinctions. Neither EPA\u2019s \namalgamation of multiple locally applicable actions \ninto a single Federal Register notice nor its reliance on \ncommon statutory interpretation and reasoning \nchanges the statutory authority underlying EPA\u2019s \naction. The interpretation advanced by EPA and \naccepted by the Tenth Circuit ignores: (1) the text of \n\n39 \n \nSection 7607 categorically listing venue for actions \nbased on the statutory authority exercised; (2) the text \nof Section 7410 delineating EPA\u2019s state-by-state \nauthority to review each State\u2019s plan; (3) the listing of \nstate \nimplementation \nplan \napprovals \nand \ndisapprovals in the regional circuit review provision; \n(4) the statutory history; and (5) the state-specific \nnature of implementation plans under the statute, \nincluding the ones by Oklahoma and Utah here. \nBecause state implementation plans are locally \napplicable, venue for Petitioners\u2019 challenges lies in the \nTenth Circuit.  \nII. EPA\u2019s disapprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and \nUtah\u2019s \nplans \nwere \nnot \nbased \non \na \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect. \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s general rule\u2014that regional \ncircuits review challenges to locally or regionally \napplicable actions\u2014has a narrow exception. Petitions \nfor review of those actions must be filed in the D.C. \nCircuit: \u201c[1] if such action is based on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect and [2] if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that \nsuch action is based on such a determination.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nThe Tenth Circuit declined to address EPA\u2019s \nargument that this exception applies to Petitioners\u2019 \nchallenges. Pet.App.19 n.8. This Court should address \nEPA\u2019s argument and reject it.  \nEPA asserted that it based the disapprovals on \ndeterminations of \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d for two \nreasons. 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. First, EPA claimed that \nit was \u201cinterpreting and applying\u201d the Act\u2019s Good \n\n40 \n \nNeighbor Provision \u201cbased on a common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis \nconcerning the interstate transport of pollutants \nthroughout the continental U.S.\u201d Id. Second, EPA \nfound that \u201cnational uniformity in judicial resolution \nof any petitions for review is desirable\u201d in order \u201cto \neliminate the risk of inconsistent results for different \nstates\u201d from different circuits.

EPA\u2019s actions disapproving Oklahoma\u2019s \nand Utah\u2019s plans were not based on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or \neffect. \nHere, EPA\u2019s actions to disapprove Oklahoma\u2019s \nand Utah\u2019s state plans were based on determinations \nof facts specific to each State. Those determinations \nhad consequences specific and unique to each State \nand the regulated sources within each State\u2019s borders, \nnot to the nation as a whole. So, EPA\u2019s effort to invoke \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s exception to funnel these state \nimplementation plan disapprovals to the D.C. Circuit \nmust fail.    \nYet, when invoking Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s exception, \nEPA ignored its own state-by-state inquiries and \ninstead argued its use of a 4-step analytical \nframework, reference to national emissions modeling, \nand desire to avoid inconsistencies satisfy the \n\u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d requirement. 88 Fed. Reg. \nat \n9,380-81. \nBut \nthese \naspects \nof \nEPA\u2019s \ndecisionmaking \nprocess \ndo \nnot \nconstitute \nthe \ndeterminations on which EPA\u2019s decision to approve or \ndisapprove specific state plans was based. EPA \nconsidered these factors in its state plan approvals \nand disapprovals alike. The core findings that made \nthe difference as to whether any given plan was \napproved or disapproved rested on findings unique to \n\n45 \n \neach State\u2019s submission. Because the determinations \nEPA\u2019s actions were ultimately \u201cbased on\u201d are state-\nspecific, they are not nationwide in scope or effect.  \n1. \nEPA\u2019s determinations were based on \nstate-specific \nfacts \nand \ncircum- \nstances.  \nThe determinations on which EPA based its \napproval or disapproval of each State\u2019s plan were \nspecific to each particular state plan and the facts \nspecific to the emissions within the respective States \nor regions. The disapprovals therefore were not \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nWhen EPA approves or disapproves state plans, \nthose actions will almost always be \u201cbased on\u201d \ndeterminations of local scope and effect. As explained, \nthe statute requires EPA\u2019s review of state plans to be \nstate-specific. See supra 23-24. States enjoy \u201cwide \ndiscretion\u201d and \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d in crafting \ntheir implementation plans. Union Elec. Co., 427 U.S. \nat 250; Train, 421 U.S. at 87. Congress delegated to \nStates, not EPA, the power to make \u201clegislative \nchoices in regulating air pollution.\u201d Union Elec. Co., \n427 U.S. at 269. Although EPA may voice a \u201cpreferred \napproach\u201d for state plans, it may not erase State \ndiscretion by insisting on its preference. Train, 421 \nU.S. at 69. A State\u2019s development and EPA\u2019s review of \na state plan also involves \u201ca number of intensely \nfactual determinations\u201d about the \u201cparticularities of \nthe emissions sources\u201d in the State and other local \nconditions. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 421; Kentucky, \n2024 WL 5001991, at *12 (EPA, in the same Federal \n\n46 \n \nRegister notice as the actions in this case, rejected \nKentucky\u2019s \nGood \nNeighbor \nplan \n\u201cdue \nto \n\u2018circumstances \u2026 unique\u2019 to that plan\u201d (citation \nomitted)). So when EPA chooses to disapprove a \nState\u2019s plan, it almost always must be for reasons \nspecific to that State\u2019s facts or choices rather than a \none-size-fits-all imposition infringing on statutorily \nprotected state discretion. See 41 Fed.  Reg. at 56,768-\n69 (Administrative Conference of the United States \nrecommendation) (actions on state plans \u201cusually \ninvolve issues peculiar to the affected States\u201d).  \nTo be sure, occasionally an EPA action with \nrespect to States may involve \u201cgeneric determinations \nof nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Id. at 56,767-68. For \nexample, when EPA is \u201cpromulgat[ing] \u2026 generic \nregulations (applicable to all States) that require \nprevention of significant deterioration of air quality,\u201d \nthe action is based on determinations of nationwide \nscope or effect. Id. at 56,769 (citation omitted). \u201cAs \nwith national standards, such actions typically involve \nestablishment or application of uniform principles for \nall States, are taken on a single administrative record, \nand do not involve factual questions unique to \nparticular geographic regions.\u201d Id. at 56,769 n.2. An \nagency decision to publish multiple, discrete final \nactions in a single notice does not, however, change \nthe scope of the relevant determinations. The scope of \nthe notice itself does not matter because it \u201cimproperly \nfocuses on the nature of the rule as a whole and not on \nthe determinations on which [each action] is based.\u201d \nTexas 2016, 829 F.3d at 422. \n\n47 \n \nTrue to form, EPA\u2019s disapprovals here each \ninvolved \nstate-specific \nanalysis \nand \nreasoning. \nConsider Oklahoma\u2019s state plan. Air quality models \nprojected emissions sources in Oklahoma would \ncontribute \nto \nozone \ndownwind, \nand \nthose \ncontributions to downwind States are different from \nany other State. Oklahoma analyzed those state-\nspecific projections using region-specific modeling \nprepared by Texas, not EPA\u2019s national modeling. \nOklahoma concluded it would not \u201csignificantly\u201d \ncontribute to any downwind State, based in part on \nOklahoma\u2019s recent history of significantly reducing \nemissions, \nthus \nsatisfying \nits \nGood \nNeighbor \nobligations. J.A.23a-24a, 26a.   \nEPA disapproved Oklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it \nconcluded Oklahoma failed to correctly \u201canalyze \nemissions from the sources and other emissions \nactivity from within the State to determine whether \nits \ncontributions \n[to \ndownwind \nStates] \nwere \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. at 9,823-24. EPA pointed \nspecifically \nto \nOklahoma\u2019s \nprojected \nozone \n\u201ccontribution [of] 1.01 ppb to Denton County, Texas.\u201d \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9,359. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s \nreliance on alternative air quality modeling and \nOklahoma\u2019s approach to calculating whether a \ndownwind \u201creceptor\u201d was likely to struggle to \n\u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the NAAQS. Id.; 87 Fed. \nReg. \nat \n9,823-24. \nEPA\u2019s \nultimate \nreason \nfor \ndisapproving Oklahoma\u2019s plan thus constituted a \nstate-specific, factual determinations.  \nUtah\u2019s Good Neighbor plan was no less state-\nspecific. Utah\u2019s state plan identified areas around \n\n48 \n \nDenver to which Utah contributes more than 1% of the \n2015 Ozone NAAQS of 70 ppb. J.A.40a. Utah \nidentified five locations in Colorado where individual \ncontributions from Utah ranged between 0.83 ppb and \n1.23 ppb. J.A.40a. Utah then applied a weight-of-\nevidence approach to assess whether under the \nconditions specific to Utah and Colorado, Utah \ncontributed \u201csignificantly\u201d to nonattainment or \n\u201cinterfere[ed] with\u201d maintenance in downwind States. \nJ.A.42a-57a.   \nUtah concluded that those contributions to \ndownwind States were not significant. Utah based \nthat conclusion in part on the differences between \nprojected contributions by Utah compared to other \nstates. Utah explained that in Eastern States, total \ncontributions from the cumulative impact of upwind \nStates are very high; Utah cited Connecticut as an \nexample, noting that it received a collective upwind \ncontribution of 44.24 ppb, which is 12 times greater \nthan the sources of air pollution from within \nConnecticut. J.A.47a. By contrast, the dynamic in the \nWest is flipped, and in-state contributions are much \nmore significant than the total contribution from \nupwind States. J.A.49a. In Colorado, the highest \ncollective upwind contribution at relevant areas was \n7.06 ppb, while in-state contributions for that same \narea were 25.52 ppb. J.A.49a. Utah also pointed to the \nozone contributions from international emissions, \nwildfires, and biogenic emissions, which contributed \nmuch more ozone \u201ccompared to those modeled as \ncoming from Utah.\u201d J.A.49a-51a. Indeed, biogenic \nemissions (natural sources of emissions) alone \n\n49 \n \ncontribute between 4.19 ppb and 5.71 ppb to Colorado \nreceptors, while Utah contributes one-quarter of this \namount. J.A.49a.  \nBased on this weight-of-evidence approach, \nconsidering all factors taken together, Utah concluded \nthat contributions to downwind air quality are not \nsignificant and additional emission reductions are not \nnecessary. J.A.57a. The State also analyzed the \nsubstantial emission reductions between 2011 and \n2017 that resulted from enforceable permit and \nregulatory requirements, as well as additional \ncontrols included in the plan for the Salt Lake City \narea and updated rules for oil and gas sources. \nJ.A.51a-57a. These data showed that emissions from \nUtah were decreasing and would continue to decrease.   \nEPA\u2019s reasons for disapproving Utah\u2019s proposed \nplan were that (1) \u201cUtah is projected to be linked above \n1 percent of the NAAQS to three nonattainment \nreceptors \nand \none \nmaintenance-only \nreceptor \u2026 [located in] Colorado\u201d; (2) \u201cthe State \nincluded an insufficient evaluation of additional \nemissions control opportunities\u201d; (3) there were \n\u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and \nnon-anthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of \nupwind \nversus \ndownwind-state \nresponsibilities\u201d; \n(4) \u201cseveral anticipated controls identified by Utah \nwere included in the [later modeling performed by \nEPA], and yet Utah was still linked in that modeling\u201d; \nand (5) Utah\u2019s Western-specific arguments supporting \nits submission were unconvincing. 88 Fed. Reg. at \n9,360. These could not be more local determinations. \n\n50 \n \nOklahoma and Utah are not outliers. Every \nState\u2019s Good Neighbor plan was unique and therefore \nthe determinations at the core of EPA\u2019s decisions on \nthe States\u2019 plans varied. For instance, California\u2019s \nplan included an analysis focused on state-specific \nimpacts related to the geography, meteorology, and \nwildfires as well as local, international, and non-\nanthropogenic emissions. Id. at 9,355. It also \u201cargued \nthat it had already implemented all cost-effective \ncontrols\u201d \nand \n\u201cthat \ninterstate \ntransport \nis \nfundamentally different in the western U.S. than in \nthe eastern U.S.\u201d Id.  \nEPA ultimately rejected California\u2019s plan because \nit presented \u201can insufficient evaluation of additional \ncontrol opportunities\u201d as well as \u201ctechnical and legal \nflaws in California\u2019s geographic, meteorological, \nwildfire, and trajectories analysis, and the State\u2019s \narguments related to local, international, and non-\nanthropogenic emissions.\u201d Id. In contrast, EPA \napproved Idaho\u2019s plan because \u201cthe impacts from \nemissions from sources in Idaho will not exceed a \ncontribution threshold of 1 percent of the 2015 ozone \nNAAQS to any downwind nonattainment and \nmaintenance sites,\u201d in part because \u201cannual total \n[ozone precursor] emissions have declined\u201d as a result \nof \u201creductions in emissions from onroad and nonroad \nvehicles\u201d in Idaho. 85 Fed. Reg. 65,722, 65,724-25 (Oct. \n16, 2020).  \nBecause EPA\u2019s disapprovals or approvals of each \nState\u2019s Good Neighbor plan were based on a review of \nthe specific facts and merits of that plan, EPA\u2019s core \n\n51 \n \njustifications for its actions did not have nationwide \nscope or effect. \n2. \nEPA\u2019s actions were not based on its \npreference for a uniform policy-\nbased framework.  \nEPA asserted that it made and relied on several \nnationwide determinations. But none of those \npurported determinations constitute \u201cthe reason the \nagency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas 2016, 829 \nF.3d at 419; West Virginia, 90 F.4th at 329 (\u201cvenue \nturns on the EPA\u2019s reasons for determining that West \nVirginia\u2019s [Good Neighbor plan] was insufficient\u201d). \nThey are not the \u201cultimate decision\u201d upon which the \nactions to disapprove Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans \nwere based. Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at *12. \nFirst, EPA relies principally on its use of a \n\u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate transport \nframework for assessing obligations for the 2015 ozone \nNAAQS.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But that framework \nsimply \u201cprovide[s] a reasonable organization to the \nanalysis of the complex air quality challenge of \ninterstate ozone transport.\u201d Id. at 9,338. The \nframework is not mandated by the Clean Air Act, \ncodified in any regulation, or otherwise required by \nEPA. See id. at 9,375 (\u201cEPA does not direct states to \nuse a particular framework\u201d). EPA in fact told States \nthat they were free to \u201cdevelop alternative frameworks \nto evaluate interstate transport obligations in their \nstate plans.\u201d No. 23-9514 (10th Cir.), J.A.107; see also \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9,338 (explaining that \u201cstates have \nsome flexibility in developing analytical methods \nwithin this framework (and may also attempt to \n\n52 \n \njustify an alternative framework altogether)\u201d). EPA \nthus confirmed it would judge the appropriateness of \nthe State\u2019s chosen framework \u201cin light of the facts and \ncircumstances of each particular state\u2019s submission,\u201d \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9,340, as the statute requires, supra \n23-24. \nEPA\u2019s \n4-step \nframework \norganized \nEPA\u2019s \nanalysis, but it did not in itself constitute the core \njustification for the denial of Oklahoma\u2019s or Utah\u2019s \nproposed plans. Indeed, EPA\u2019s reference to a common \nanalytical framework is not a \u201cdetermination\u201d at all. \nKentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at *11-12. EPA applied \nthe same 4-step framework to analyze each state plan \nit reviewed. But, once again, EPA approved some \nplans and disapproved others using the same \nframework. EPA\u2019s \u201creason[s]\u201d for approving or \ndisapproving a given state plan thus necessarily \ndepended on state-specific facts and considerations. \nTexas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419; Kentucky, 2024 WL \n5001991, at *11-12.  \nIn short, EPA\u2019s 4-step framework did not dictate \nthe outcome of any disapproval decision because EPA \nrightly admitted it was non-binding. Nor could the \nframework have been the determination on which its \ndecision to disapprove was based because both \napproval and disapproval actions used the 4-step \nframework\u2014proving \nthat \nstate-specific \ndeterminations were the ultimate bases for EPA\u2019s \nactions. \nSecond, EPA contended that it made a nationwide \ndetermination when it relied on \u201cthe results from \nnationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 Fed. \n\n53 \n \nReg. at 9,381; see also id. at 9,338-39 (describing this \nmodeling). But EPA also made clear that States could \nrely \non \nalternate \nmethodologies \nfor \nmodeling \nemissions, including relying on modeling conducted by \nother States, which might better incorporate state-\nspecific information and data. No. 23-9514 (10th Cir.), \nJ.A.68, 73-74. Some States, like Utah, analyzed their \nfuture contributions to downwind States by reference \nto EPA\u2019s modeling and data. J.A.37a-39a. But others, \nlike Texas and Oklahoma, relied on non-EPA \nmodeling designed to more accurately project future \nemissions and air quality levels in surrounding States. \nJ.A.13a-14a. In rejecting state plans that relied on \nregion-specific modeling, EPA necessarily made \nintensely factual state-specific determinations.   \nRegardless, EPA\u2019s choice to conduct nationwide \nmodeling was not the core justification on which its \ndecision to approve or disapprove any state plan was \nbased. As with the 4-step framework, EPA considered \nits ozone modeling for every state plan it reviewed. \nSee, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. at 9,478-80, 9,482-43; 87 Fed. \nReg. at 9,800, 9,822. But that modeling merely \nidentified specific local downwind sites to which an \nupwind State might contribute ozone. See 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9,341-42. States (and EPA) then had to evaluate \nwhether those individual local projections amounted \nto \u201csignificant[]\u201d contributions from upwind States \nbased on the facts and circumstances of each State. \n\u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). That was the core determination \nthat governed whether EPA approved or disapproved \na state plan.  \n\n54 \n \nThird, EPA claimed that it \u201cevaluated each state\u2019s \narguments for the use of alternative approaches or \nalternative sets of data with an eye to ensuring \nnational consistency and avoiding inconsistent or \ninequitable results\u201d between upwind and downwind \nStates. 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,381. But that is no surprise. \nAs already explained, if EPA treats similarly situated \nStates inconsistently, it acts unlawfully. Supra 32-33. \nThe mere fact that it sought to avoid arbitrary \ndecision-making cannot be enough to make an action \nnationwide in scope or effect.  \n3. \nEPA\u2019s desire to consolidate judicial \nreview \ndoes \nnot \nconstitute \na \ndetermination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  \nFinally, EPA argued that any challenges to its \nstate plan disapprovals should be made in the D.C. \nCircuit because \u201cnational uniformity in judicial \nresolution of any petitions for review is desirable \u2026 to \neliminate the risk of inconsistent results for different \nstates.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,381. But EPA did not contend \nthat this desire for uniformity was a \u201cdetermination\u201d \non which EPA\u2019s state plan disapprovals were based. \nSection 7607(b)(1) therefore does not allow EPA to rely \non its desire for consolidated judicial review to \ndesignate an action for review only in the D.C. Circuit. \nNor do EPA\u2019s concerns about judicial review have \nany validity. Each State is unique and each submitted \nGood Neighbor plan was \u201cevaluated on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,354. That is precisely why \nCongress sent challenges to state plan approvals or \ndisapprovals to the regional circuits, the courts most \n\n55 \n \nfamiliar with the facts and circumstances of the States \nin their region.  \nPlan-by-plan judicial review may produce \u201c[s]ome \nvariation,\u201d but that is the \u201cexpected\u201d operation of \nSection 7607(b)(1). Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 423. \n\u201c[I]ntercircuit conflicts in the application of EPA \npolicies caused by inconsistent judicial decisions are \ninevitable because of the Act\u2019s judicial review \nprovision in \u00a7 7607(b)(1).\u201d Nat\u2019l Envtl. Dev. Ass\u2019n\u2019s \nClean Air Project v. EPA, 891 F.3d 1041, 1050 (D.C. \nCir. 2018) (holding EPA reasonably and permissibly \ninterpreted \nthe \nAct \nto \nallow \nintercircuit \nnonacquiescence). And there is \u201c\u2018wisdom\u2019 in \u2018allowing \ndifficult issues to mature through full consideration\u2019 \nby different courts.\u201d Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at \n*10 (quoting E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, \n430 U.S. 112, 135 n.26 (1977)). Congress weighed the \npossibility of conflicting judicial decisions and \ndetermined that when the action is locally applicable \nand not based on determinations of nationwide scope \nor effect, the regional circuits should be the exclusive \nvenue regardless.  \n* \n* \n* \nBecause EPA\u2019s action on each state plan rested on \njustifications unique to each plan\u2019s \u201cown merits,\u201d \nregardless of any uniform approach that EPA sought \nto \nuse, \nEPA\u2019s \nactions \nwere \nnot \nbased \non \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect. EPA\u2019s \nreliance on Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s exception to regional \ncircuit review of EPA\u2019s state implementation plan \ndecisions therefore fails. \n\n56 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.  \n \nDecember 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSEAN D.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial understanding was that this case centered on a statutory interpretation of the Clean Air Act's jurisdictional provisions, but I lacked specific details on the legal arguments and precedents.\n\nThe petitioner's brief on the merits has significantly sharpened my beliefs. I now understand the precise statutory provision at issue is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), which governs judicial review of EPA actions. The petitioners, Oklahoma and Utah, are advancing two primary arguments that provide a clear framework for predicting the Court's ruling.\n\nFirst, their core argument is textual and structural. They contend that the plain language of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) explicitly assigns review of EPA actions \"approving or promulgating any implementation plan under section 7410\" to the appropriate regional circuit court. They argue that disapproving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) is the functional equivalent and is inherently a \"locally or regionally applicable\" action. A crucial piece of evidence for this position is their citation of a D.C. Circuit opinion authored by then-Judge Kavanaugh, *American Road & Transportation Builders Ass'n v. EPA*, which described EPA action on an implementation plan as the \"prototypical 'locally or regionally applicable' action.\" This signal is highly relevant for predicting at least one Justice's leanings. Petitioners argue that the EPA cannot unilaterally alter this statutory venue scheme simply by bundling multiple, distinct, state-specific disapprovals into a single Federal Register notice. The substance of the action (disapproving Oklahoma's plan) is local, and the form of publication does not change that.\n\nSecond, the petitioners address the statute's exception, which allows for D.C. Circuit review if an action is \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\" They argue this exception is inapplicable because the *basis* for the EPA's disapproval of each state's plan was state-specific data and analysis, not a single, overarching nationwide determination. They characterize the EPA's use of a \"consistent analysis\" and its desire to \"consolidate judicial review\" as procedural conveniences, not a substantive \"determination of nationwide scope or effect\" as required by the statute.\n\nFinally, the brief confirms the existence of a significant circuit split, with the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits siding with the regional venue interpretation, while the Tenth Circuit (in the decision below) created a direct conflict by siding with the EPA. This split is the procedural reason the Supreme Court granted certiorari and highlights that the legal question is genuinely contested among the lower courts. My understanding has evolved from a general awareness of a jurisdictional dispute to a detailed knowledge of the petitioners' specific textualist arguments, their key supporting precedent from a sitting Justice, and their rebuttal to the EPA's likely counterarguments.",

EPA deter-\nmined that those state plans would not adequately \u201cpro-\nhibit[]  * * *  emissions activity within the State\u201d from \n\u201ccontribut[ing] significantly to nonattainment in, or  \ninterfer[ing] with maintenance by, any other State\u201d of \nnational ambient air-quality standards.  42 U.S.C. \n7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  The question presented is as follows:  \nWhether EPA\u2019s disapproval action is subject to re-\nview only in the D.C.

App. \n1a-19a, 23-1068 Pet. App. 1a-17a), is reported at 93 F.4th \n1262. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 27, 2024.  The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The question presented is as follows:  \nWhether EPA\u2019s disapproval action is subject to re-\nview only in the D.C. Circuit under 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), \nwhich channels to that court petitions to review EPA fi-\nnal actions that are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 2 \nStatement: \nA.

The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther judicial economy, and eliminate the risk of in-\nconsistent results for different states.\u201d  Ibid.; see J.A. \n181a-186a.  \n2. Various States and industry groups challenged \nEPA\u2019s disapproval action with respect to 12 state plans.  \nThose challenges were filed in the D.C. Circuit and in \nseven regional circuits.1  Petitioners Oklahoma and \n \n1 See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418 (4th Cir. Apr. 14, \n2023); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069 (5th Cir.

EPA, No. 23-\n \n\n10 \n \nUtah (State petitioners), as well as eight industry par-\nticipants (Industry petitioners) within those States, \nfiled petitions for review in both the Tenth and D.C. Cir-\ncuits.2  In the Tenth Circuit, EPA moved to transfer \nvenue to the D.C. Circuit or to dismiss for improper \nvenue.  Pet. App. 8a.3  A motions panel stayed the dis-\napproval action as to the state plans submitted by Okla-\nhoma and Utah, and it referred the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer venue to the merits panel.  Id. at 10a-11a. \nA unanimous Tenth Circuit merits panel granted \nEPA\u2019s motion and transferred the petitions to the D.C. \nCircuit.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.  The court explained that, un-\nder the \u201cplain text\u201d of Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cwhether a pe-\ntition for review belongs in the D.C. Circuit turns exclu-\nsively on the nature of the challenged agency action,\u201d \nnot on \u201cthe scope of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.\u201d  Id. at \n12a.   \nThe court of appeals concluded that, \u201c[o]n its face,\u201d \nthe disapproval action is nationally applicable.  Pet. \nApp. 12a.  The court emphasized that the action disap-\nproves state plans \u201cfrom 21 states across the country\u2014\n \n1719 (8th Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); ALLETE, Inc. v.

Apr. 14, 2023).   \n3 Unless otherwise noted, all references in this brief to the \u201cPet. \nApp.\u201d are to the State petitioners\u2019 petition appendix in No. 23-1067.   \n\n11 \n \nspanning eight EPA regions and ten federal judicial  \ncircuits\u2014because those states all failed to comply with \nthe good-neighbor provision.\u201d  Ibid.  The court further \nexplained that, in the disapproval action, EPA had \u201cap-\nplied a uniform statutory interpretation and common \nanalytical methods\u201d to examine the \u201coverlapping and in-\nterwoven linkages between upwind and downwind \nstates in a consistent manner.\u201d  Id. at 12a-13a.   \nPetitioners argued that EPA\u2019s disapproval action \nshould be treated for venue purposes as multiple indi-\nvidual actions, each applying to a single State.  The \ncourt of appeals rejected that contention, noting that \nthe text of Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cdirects courts to consider \nonly the face of the \u2018final action.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 13a.  The \ncourt therefore viewed it as irrelevant that EPA \u201ccould \nhave chosen to issue standalone\u201d disapprovals for each \nof the 21 States.  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals recognized that motions panels \nof the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits had recently de-\nnied EPA\u2019s motions to transfer petitions challenging the \ndisapproval action.  Pet. App. 17a.  But the court con-\ncluded that those courts had \u201cstrayed from \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \ntext and instead applied a petition-focused approach\u201d \nthat considered the scope of the petitioners\u2019 challenge \nrather than the face of the agency action itself.  Ibid.  \nThe court also noted that the contrary decisions of those \nother circuits had \u201cgenerated strong dissents highlight-\ning critical flaws in the majority opinions.\u201d  Id. at 18a.   \nBecause the court of appeals concluded that the dis-\napproval action is nationally applicable, the court de-\nclined to address EPA\u2019s alternative argument that the \nrule \u201cis based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a n.8 (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)).   \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals transferred the petitions to the \nD.C. Circuit.  That court subsequently ordered that the \ncases be held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision.  \n23-1103 Order (Nov. 6, 2024).  The disapproval action \nremains stayed as to Oklahoma and Utah pending judi-\ncial review.   \n3. The other regional circuits issued interlocutory \nmotions-panel decisions that either denied transfer or \nreferred the venue question to the merits panel.  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323 (4th Cir. 2024) (denying \ntransfer motion); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL \n7204840 (5th Cir. May 1, 2023) (per curiam) (same); \nKentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2023 WL 11871967 (6th \nCir. July 25, 2023) (same); 23-1320 Order, Arkansas v. \nEPA (8th Cir. Apr. 25, 2023) (same); 23-682 Order, Ne-\nvada Cement Co. v. EPA (9th Cir. July 3, 2023) (refer-\nring the venue question to the merits panel); 23-11173 \nOrder, Alabama v. EPA (11th Cir. July 12, 2023) \n(same).   \nAfter this Court granted certiorari, a merits panel of \nthe Sixth Circuit held that it had venue over Kentucky\u2019s \nchallenge to EPA\u2019s disapproval action, and the court va-\ncated the disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on the merits.  \nKentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447 (2024).   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the dis-\napproval action here is reviewable only in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments impose atextual \nrequirements and fail to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To determine \nwhether a particular EPA action is \u201cnationally applica-\n\n13 \n \nble,\u201d a court must consider the action on its face.  The \ndisapproval action here is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d be-\ncause it addresses state plan submissions from 21 \nStates in ten federal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, petitioners \nseek to impose atextual restrictions on the availability \nof D.C. Circuit review.  Petitioners argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat EPA\u2019s disapproval of \neach State\u2019s plan submission as a separate \u201cfinal ac-\ntion.\u201d  But this Court has long recognized that agencies \nhave discretion to devise their own procedures, includ-\ning by aggregating common issues for joint resolution.  \nEPA acted reasonably in taking that approach here.  And \n\n14 \n \nin determining the proper venue for challenges to the \nagency\u2019s disapproval action, the Court should focus on \nthe action that EPA actually took, rather than on a hy-\npothetical array of 21 separate, State-specific disapprov-\nals. \nPetitioners also assert that the disapproval action \nmust be \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d because Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) specifically channels to the \u201cappropriate \ncircuit\u201d an EPA action \u201capproving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any other final action  * * *  \nunder [the CAA] (including any denial or disapproval \n[under title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But that language \ndoes not say that a denial or disapproval action is locally \nor regionally applicable.  It merely provides that a chal-\nlenge to any such action \u201cwhich is locally or regionally \napplicable may be filed only in the  . . .  appropriate re-\ngional circuit\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 11a-12a n.5 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1)) (brackets omitted).  Whether a particular \ndenial or disapproval is locally or regionally applicable \nis for the reviewing court to decide. \nB. Even if this Court disregards the framing of the \ndisapproval action and views EPA\u2019s disapproval of each \nState\u2019s plan as a distinct \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, those actions are still reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  EPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d and EPA published its finding to that effect in ac-\ncordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn linking proper venue to a \u201cdetermination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on \nthe underlying reasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d \n\n15 \n \nthe relevant determinations, indicating that the deter-\nminations must be a but-for cause of the agency\u2019s final \naction\u2014forming the core of the agency\u2019s analysis.  To \nbe nationwide in scope or effect, the core justifications \nfor EPA\u2019s final action must be intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the \ncountry, or have legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nThe disapproval action here meets those require-\nments.  The disapproval action is based on determinations \nthat have nationwide scope and effect, including:  (1) \nEPA\u2019s decision to use updated, 2016-based modeling in \nassessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion across the country; (2) EPA\u2019s decision to apply a \n1% contribution threshold to each State to assess \nwhether the State contributed more than a de minimis \namount of ozone pollution downwind; (3) EPA\u2019s deter-\nmination that the relative magnitude of other sources\u2019 \ncontributions to nonattainment in downwind States \ncould not justify inaction by the upwind States at issue; \nand (4) EPA\u2019s position that a linked State cannot rely \non current controls or anticipated emissions reductions \nthat are not incorporated into the state plans them-\nselves.  Those determinations formed the core of EPA\u2019s \nanalysis in rejecting the state plan submissions, and the \nagency relied on each determination in acting on Good \nNeighbor plan submissions across the country.    \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the disapproval action would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\n16 \n \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA established a uni-\nform legal framework for state implementation plans \nspanning multiple States in multiple judicial circuits.  In \namending the statute to its current form, Congress \nadopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel, who urged that challenges to such actions \nshould be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccentralize \nreview\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Circuit\u2019s] ad-\nministrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitating an or-\nderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA would ap-\nply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 (Dec. 30, \n1976).   \nPetitioners contend that the statutory term \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d refers only to the ultimate disposition of the \nmatter before the agency.  But that reading erases the \ndistinction that Section 7607(b)(1) draws between the \nagency \u201caction\u201d and the \u201cdetermination\u201d on which the \naction is \u201cbased.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners fur-\nther observe that EPA also considered State-specific \nfacts in disapproving each of the state plan submissions \nhere.  But the statute\u2019s third prong is not limited to \nEPA actions that are based solely on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a limitation \nmake sense.  The third prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \ncomes into play only when the challenged EPA action is \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and such actions al-\nmost always will rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Ibid.    \nPetitioners are also incorrect in asserting that EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation would authorize D.C. Circuit venue for \nchallenges to every locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n17 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DISAPPROVAL ACTION  \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to ex-\nclusive D.C. Circuit review.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \neven if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. Circuit if \nthat action is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect and if in taking such action the Adminis-\ntrator finds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause EPA\u2019s disapproval action addresses the \nstate plan submissions of 21 States across the country, \nthe action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the meaning \nof Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if (as petition-\ners urge) the Court views the disapproval action as com-\nprising 21 separate \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \nstate plan disapprovals, those disapprovals are still re-\nviewable only in the D.C. Circuit because they are based \non determinations of nationwide scope and effect.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan was grounded in \nEPA\u2019s determinations regarding the proper implemen-\ntation of the Good Neighbor requirements that are im-\nposed on States throughout the country and that affect \n\n18 \n \nthe legal obligations of downwind and upwind States in \nmultiple judicial circuits. \nThe numerous challenges to the disapproval action, \nbrought in eight judicial circuits across the country, il-\nlustrate the outcome that Section 7607(b)(1) was intended \nto prevent.  In arguing for regional-circuit venue, States \nand industry participants have emphasized the State-\nspecific factors that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval \nof various state plans.  In briefing their challenges on \nthe merits, however, those States and industry partici-\npants have focused primarily on EPA\u2019s nationwide de-\nterminations, causing eight different courts of appeals \nto expend resources considering nearly identical chal-\nlenges.   \nBoth because it governs state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits, and because it rests on EPA determina-\ntions that apply nationwide, the disapproval action is \nprecisely the type of EPA action that Congress re-\ngarded as appropriate for centralized D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  Under petitioners\u2019 venue analysis, however, sim-\nilar EPA actions would continue to spawn parallel chal-\nlenges in multiple circuits, wasting judicial resources \nand heightening the risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Con-\ngress crafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and \nthis Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.   \nA. The Disapproval Action Is Nationally Applicable \nThe disapproval action addressed the state plan sub-\nmissions of 21 States located in multiple judicial circuits \nacross the country.  It therefore is apparent on the face \nof the final action that it is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and sub-\nject to review in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nPetitioners\u2019 contrary arguments lack merit.   \n\n19 \n \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the disapproval action is nationally \napplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the disapproval action at issue here be-\ncause that action applies to state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits across the country.  The statutory context \nand history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. Cir-\ncuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis meant \nto cover comprehensively every manner in which an \nagency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And under \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the choice between D.C. \nCircuit and regional-circuit venue turns on the nature \nof the pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for \na particular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n12a; Hunt Ref. Co. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. \n2024); Southern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, \n671 (7th Cir. 2017); American Road & Transp. Builders \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK \nLaunch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. \n2011).  Courts thus must look to the face of the action \nand determine whether it applies to\u2014or includes \n\u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 91 (5th ed. \n1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201capply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout \n[the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 1505 (1976) (Web-\nster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnationally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\n\n20 \n \nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \n \n4 Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n21 \n \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions for which the 1970 statute specified D.C. \nCircuit review were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d and Con-\ngress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven and \nconsistent national application.\u201d  1970 Senate Report \n41.  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approv-\ning or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run \nonly to one air quality control region\u201d as amenable to \nreview \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in \nwhich the affected air quality control region, or portion \nthereof, is located,\u201d ibid., which the statute referred to \nas \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) \n(1970).   \n\n22 \n \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  The House Report con-\ntrasted such local actions with nationally relevant ac-\ntions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d and \ntherefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Circuit \nreview.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the conclu-\nsion that, under the venue provision in its current form, \nfinal EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple judi-\ncial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the disap-\nproval action is nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] \nits power\u201d through a single final action that applies to \nsubmissions from 21 States across the country, span-\nning ten federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 U.S. at \n478; see Pet. App. 12a.  On a plain-text understanding, \nthe disapproval action is therefore \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d and petitioners\u2019 challenges to the action can pro-\nceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary approach to venue is incon-\nsistent with the statutory text  \nPetitioners argue that the disapproval action is not \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d because it should be viewed for \nvenue purposes as 21 separate disapprovals of 21 state \nplan submissions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Petitioners further contend that the dis-\napproval action must be locally or regionally applicable \n\n23 \n \nbecause Section 7607(b)(1) specifically refers to a denial \nor disapproval as an example of a locally or regionally \napplicable action.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. Petitioners contend (State Br. 22-26; Industry Br. \n32-33) that, for purposes of the venue provision, the rel-\nevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is not the single disapproval action \napplicable to 21 States, but rather 21 separate actions \ndisapproving individual state plans.  That argument dis-\nregards EPA\u2019s decision to consider and rule on the var-\nious state plans together, and it is untethered to the \nstatutory text.   \nPetitioners assert (State Br. 23; Industry Br. 32-33) \nthat each individual plan disapproval must be a review-\nable final action because Section 7410 requires \u201c[e]ach \nState\u201d to develop \u201ca plan\u201d to implement the NAAQS \nand requires EPA to \u201cact[] on the submission.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(a)(1) and (k)(2) (emphases added).  The \nstatute\u2019s use of singular articles makes sense because \neach State submits a single plan, and EPA must assess \neach State\u2019s submission.  But neither Section 7410 nor \nany other CAA provision restricts EPA\u2019s ability to con-\nsider state plan submissions together and resolve com-\nmon issues in a single final action.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple state implementation plans in a single action.  \nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that administra-\ntive agencies \u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules \nof procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable \nof permitting them to discharge their multitudinous du-\nties.\u201d  FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, \n\n24 \n \n143 (1940); see Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, \n524 (1978) (\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four dec-\nades emphasized that the formulation of procedures \nwas basically to be left within the discretion of the agen-\ncies to which Congress had confided the responsibility \nfor substantive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes \nthe ability to determine \u201cwhether applications should be \nheard contemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, \n309 U.S. at 138.  Section 7410\u2019s reference to individual \nstate plan submissions is an insufficient basis for infer-\nring any constraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to group similar \nplan submissions for joint resolution.   \nNor is it relevant that EPA issued separate notices \nof proposed disapprovals for certain States.  See Indus-\ntry Br. 42-43.  Section 7607(b)(1) focuses on the \u201cfinal \naction taken,\u201d not on a proposed or hypothetical action \nthat EPA could have taken.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various state plan submissions to \ndecide the common issues that affect States across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336, 1998 WL 827315 \nat *2 (4th Cir. 1998) (Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA ac-\ntion declaring that 22 States\u2019 implementation plans \n\n25 \n \nwere inadequate and required revisions).  Indeed, such \naggregation generally is encouraged as a means of effi-\nciently adjudicating common issues.  See Committee on \nAdjudication, Administrative Conference of the United \nStates, Aggregation of Similar Claims in Agency Adju-\ndication (June 13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F.   \nConsistent with those principles, for more than 20 \nyears, EPA\u2019s practice generally has been to take a sin-\ngle final action covering multiple States when address-\ning interstate ozone requirements.  See, e.g., 63 Fed. \nReg. 57,356, 57,480 (Oct. 27, 1998).  By contrast, EPA \ntypically acts individually on most other state plan sub-\nmissions under 42 U.S.C. 7410, because most such sub-\nmissions do not raise nationally significant issues.  See, \ne.g., American Road & Transp. Builders, 705 F.3d at \n455 (Kavanaugh, J.); North Dakota v. EPA, 730 F.3d \n750, 757 (8th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1135 \n(2014).  Courts have recognized that an action address-\ning a single State\u2019s implementation plan \u201cis the proto-\ntypical \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 action\u201d under \nSection 7607(b)(1).  American Road & Transp. Build-\ners, 705 F.3d at 455; see Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th \n738, 744 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  But those decisions do not ad-\ndress EPA actions considering common issues involved \nin multiple state plans dealing with interstate ozone \ntransport.  Whether EPA acts on multiple plan submis-\nsions together or instead acts on a single submission, it \nis the face of the final action that determines the proper \nvenue for review.5  \n \n5 Petitioners allege that EPA has been inconsistent in treating \nsome multistate plan approvals as locally or regionally applicable.  \nSee State Br. 28 (citing 85 Fed. Reg. 20,165 (Apr. 10, 2020); 86 Fed. \nReg. 68,413 (Dec. 2, 2021)).  EPA stated in those actions that chal-\n \n\n26 \n \nPetitioners\u2019 position would require a reviewing court \nto look beyond the face of the action and potentially sub-\nstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit of \nanalysis.  But petitioners provide little guidance on how \ncourts would make that determination.  Lower courts \nconfronted with such arguments have generally re-\njected requests to reframe EPA\u2019s action and have fo-\ncused solely on the face of the final agency action.  See, \ne.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 387 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that EPA\u2019s \nconstruction and application to a specific context of \u201cna-\ntionally applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act\u201d ren-\ndered the agency action itself nationally applicable); Si-\nerra Club, 47 F.4th at 744 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state plans were \nnationally applicable because EPA had announced a \nnew understanding that would apply in other locations, \nthereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s national \nimplementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power Coop., \n863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were an \n\u201camalgamation of many different locally or regionally \napplicable agency actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at \n1374 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that an allocation \nof allowances among entities should be considered a \n\u201cdocument detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources in resolving threshold issues, and furthering \n \nlenges should be filed in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  See, e.g., 86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,420.  But EPA did not make any particular finding as to \nthe geographic applicability of those actions, and Section 7607(b)(1) \ndid not require it to do so.  \n\n27 \n \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Petitioners\u2019 approach, by contrast, \nwould \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the deter-\nmination of venue, where the need for clear rules is es-\npecially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at \n673.   \nPetitioners contend (State Br. 30-31; Industry Br. \n43-45) that permitting EPA to aggregate disapprovals \nwould result in EPA manipulating venue by combining \nunrelated agency actions.  But petitioners do not and \ncould not plausibly claim that EPA engaged in any such \narbitrary aggregation here.  Nor do they identify any \nprior instance when EPA has grouped otherwise unre-\nlated local actions for decision and then argued that \nvenue lay in the D.C. Circuit.  If the agency ever did so, \nthe principle we advocate here\u2014i.e., that reviewing \ncourts in determining venue should ordinarily accept \nEPA\u2019s framing of its own action\u2014would not preclude a \ncourt from rejecting a particular grouping to manipu-\nlate venue.  Cf. In re Samsung Electronics Co., 2 F.4th \n1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1445 \n(2022) (noting that courts \u201chave repeatedly assessed the \npropriety of venue by disregarding manipulative activi-\nties of the parties\u201d).  \nb. Petitioners also argue (State Br. 26-29; Industry \nBr. 33-34) that EPA\u2019s disapproval action must be \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d because Section 7607(b)(1) \nspecifically assigns EPA actions \u201capproving or promul-\ngating any implementation plan\u201d or \u201cden[ying] or dis-\napprov[ing]\u201d an implementation plan to review in \u201cthe \nappropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners \nmisread the statutory language.  See Pet. App. 11a-12a \nn.5.   \n\n28 \n \nThe first prong of Section 7607(b)(1) states that var-\nious specified EPA actions\u2014such as NAAQS, emissions \nstandards for hazardous air pollutants, and vehicle \nemissions standards\u2014are reviewable \u201conly in\u201d the D.C. \nCircuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The first prong also con-\ntains a broad catchall reference to \u201cany other nationally \napplicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken\u201d \nunder the CAA, and those actions likewise are subject \nto exclusive D.C. Circuit review.  Ibid.  The first prong\u2019s \ncatchall reference to \u201cany other nationally applicable\u201d \nactions, ibid. (emphasis added), indicates that Congress \nviewed the preceding specified actions themselves as \nnationally applicable. \nThe second prong has a similar structure, with a list \nof enumerated actions followed by a catchall.  Within \nthe second prong, however, the EPA action at issue \nhere\u2014i.e., a \u201cdenial or disapproval  * * *  under [title I \nof the CAA],\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)\u2014is not one of the \nspecific actions referenced before the catchall.  Rather, \nthe second prong\u2019s reference to an EPA \u201cdenial or dis-\napproval\u201d is contained in a parenthetical within the \ncatchall.  See ibid. (referring to \u201cany other final action  \n* * *  (including any denial or disapproval  * * *  under \n[title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally appli-\ncable\u201d).  That language indicates that EPA denials and \ndisapprovals are subject to the same venue analysis that \napplies to \u201cother final action[s]\u201d generally.  Thus, if a \nparticular denial or disapproval is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d it is subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But whether a particular \ndisapproval is locally or regionally applicable is for the \nreviewing court to decide.   \nPetitioners argue (State Br. 27) that Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s second prong specifically identifies EPA \n\n29 \n \napprovals of implementation plans as \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable,\u201d and that \u201cit would make little sense to \nthink that disapprovals of the same implementation \nplans should be litigated in a different venue.\u201d  That ar-\ngument ignores Congress\u2019s decision to include plan ap-\nprovals, but not plan disapprovals, in the list of enumer-\nated EPA actions at the beginning of the second prong.  \nIn any event, in listing actions like the \u201capproval or \npromulgation\u201d of an implementation plan, Congress had \nin mind actions that \u201crun only to one air quality control \nregion.\u201d  1970 Senate Report 41.  The second prong\u2019s \nreference to an EPA \u201caction in approving  * * *  any \nimplementation plan,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded), could reasonably be read as limited to the \nagency\u2019s approval of a single plan.  Under that reading, \nan EPA action approving multiple state plans would fall \noutside the enumerated categories, so that venue would \nbe governed by Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s catchalls. \nCiting the ejusdem generis canon, petitioners sug-\ngest (State Br. 25; Industry Br. 31-32) that the disap-\nproval action at issue here cannot fall under the catchall \nphrase \u201cany other nationally applicable  * * *  final ac-\ntion\u201d because the enumerated actions preceding that \nphrase necessarily span the entire country rather than \na subset of States.  But as the statutory context and his-\ntory show, see pp. 19-22, supra, an action need not apply \nto all 50 States to be \u201cnationally applicable.\u201d  And some \nof the enumerated actions referenced in Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong can, and regularly do, apply to \nfewer than 50 States.  For example, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nfirst prong refers to the regulation of fuels under Sec-\ntion 7545, even though certain controls or prohibitions \napply only in nonattainment areas, which are not pre-\n\n30 \n \nsent in every State.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(h)(1), (h)(6), and \n(k)(1)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(10)(D). \nAccordingly, courts have deemed various EPA ac-\ntions that applied in fewer than all 50 States, including \nnonattainment designations and calls for state imple-\nmentation plans, to be nationally applicable under Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong.  See, e.g., ATK Launch \nSys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated States\u2019 recommended nonattain-\nment designations and promulgated final designations \nfor 31 areas in 18 States across the country); Browner, \n1998 WL 827315 at *2 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated 22 state plans and declared them \ninadequate, requiring revisions); Texas v. EPA, No. 10-\n60961, 2011 WL 710598, at *2 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) \n(same as to 13 States).  Like those actions, the disap-\nproval action at issue here is nationally applicable on its \nface.  After evaluating submissions from 21 States \nacross the country, EPA ultimately concluded, \u201cbased \non a common core of nationwide policy judgments and \ntechnical analysis,\u201d that each State had failed to ade-\nquately prohibit emissions that will significantly con-\ntribute to downwind nonattainment of the 2015 ozone \nNAAQS.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \nB.  The Disapproval Action Is Based On Determinations Of \nNationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s disapproval \naction should be viewed for venue purposes as 21 dis-\ncrete disapprovals of 21 state plans, and that each such \ndisapproval is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d EPA\u2019s \naction still is reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each state plan was \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA \npublished a finding to that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n\n31 \n \n1.  The disapproval action at issue here was based on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nonly in the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA published the requisite finding, see 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9380-9381, and that finding was correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \ndetermination of that kind forms the basis of the action.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \n\n32 \n \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n461-462.  Applying that definition in the context of \nagency action, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination \nrefers to the legal consequences that determination \nproduces.  Thus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Cir-\ncuit review when EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core \njustification a principle or conclusion that is intended to \ngovern the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions through-\nout the country, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s \nfinal action has legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \n\n33 \n \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A) (requiring ap-\nplication of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to partic-\nular EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \n\n34 \n \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is best equipped \nto evaluate a particular agency action\u2014e.g., because \nchallenges are likely to focus on local or regional issues \n\u2014EPA may decline to publish the relevant finding, \nthereby ensuring that the regional circuit will have \nvenue over any challenge to the action. \nb. The disapproval action here was \u201cbased on\u201d at \nleast four \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in scope because they uniformly resolved is-\nsues regarding the appropriate application of the Good \nNeighbor Provision to plans submitted by States in \nmultiple judicial circuits.  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in effect because they produced legal conse-\nquences for States nationwide, affecting their obliga-\ntions as upwind emission sources and downwind emis-\nsion receptors.  And the final action was \u201cbased on\u201d the \ndeterminations because those determinations formed \nthe core of EPA\u2019s disapproval of the state plans.   \nFirst, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \nrely on updated, 2016-based modeling as the \u201cprimary\u201d \nbasis for its \u201cassessment of air quality conditions and \npollution contribution.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA \nused that modeling of conditions across the country in \nconsidering all of the 21 state plan submissions.  And \n\n35 \n \nthat modeling affected the manner in which responsibil-\nity for achieving compliance with the ozone NAAQS was \nallocated between upwind and downwind States.   \nSecond, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \napply a 1% contribution threshold across all States to \nassess whether a State contributed more than a de min-\nimis amount of ozone pollution downwind.  88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9371; see J.A. 251a-259a.  Although EPA considered \nadopting different thresholds for different States, EPA \nconcluded that a uniform threshold nationwide was \u201ces-\nsential\u201d for interstate ozone transport, which requires \n\u201ca unique degree of concern for consistency, parity, and \nequity across state lines\u201d in order to equitably allocate \nresponsibility for ozone pollution among all States.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9373-9374.   \nThird, EPA determined that the relative contribu-\ntions of other States or countries could not excuse a \nState from analyzing whether its own emissions \u201csignif-\nicantly\u201d contribute to downwind nonattainment.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9378.  EPA explained that the Good Neigh-\nbor provision requires all States to address their signif-\nicant contributions, and that \u201c[w]hether emissions from \nother states or other countries also contribute\u201d to the \ndownwind air quality issue \u201cis typically not relevant in \nassessing\u201d whether a State is significantly contributing \nto the problem and therefore must curb its emissions.  \nIbid.   \nFourth and finally, EPA determined that, once a \nState is identified as \u201clinked,\u201d the State cannot rely on \nemission-reduction measures that are not actually in-\ncorporated into its state plan.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9376-\n9377.  EPA explained that many States had claimed \nemission-reduction measures that were already ac-\ncounted for in EPA\u2019s modeling.  EPA therefore declined \n\n36 \n \nto \u201cdouble-count[]\u201d those measures by considering them, \nat step three of its analysis, as measures that would \neliminate significant contribution.  Id. at 9377.  EPA \nalso explained that States could not simply point to an-\nticipated upcoming reductions where such measures \nhave not been \u201crendered enforceable\u201d by inclusion \nwithin the state plan itself, because such measures \ncould then be \u201cmodified or amended in ways that would \nundermine the basis for the state\u2019s reliance on them.\u201d  \nId. at 9376.   \nEach of those determinations had nationwide scope, \nas each governed EPA\u2019s assessment of state plan sub-\nmissions across the country.  The determinations also \nhad nationwide effect because an EPA decision con-\ncerning one State\u2019s Good Neighbor plan can affect the \nlegal obligations of other States, particularly those \ndownwind.  Those effects are a consequence of the in-\nterwoven linkages across the country that characterize \ninterstate ozone transport, and of the CAA requirement \nthat every State must come into compliance with the \nNAAQS by the statutory deadline.  See Wisconsin v. \nEPA, 938 F.3d 303, 313 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam); 42 \nU.S.C. 7511(a)(1); J.A. 268a-272a.  As a result of the \nlinkages, EPA\u2019s assessment of upwind States\u2019 imple-\nmentation plans and the control measures necessary for \nthose States to comply with Good Neighbor obligations \nnecessarily affects the amount of emissions for which \nthe downwind States (and potentially other linked up-\nwind States) will be responsible.   \nFor example, 25.8% of the ozone in Galveston \nCounty, Texas comes from upwind States, with contri-\nbutions above the 1% threshold from Alabama, Arkan-\n\n37 \n \nsas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.6  All five \nlinked States concluded for various reasons that they do \nnot significantly contribute to ozone pollution in Texas.  \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9355, 9357-9359.  If EPA had \napplied the higher threshold that various States advo-\ncated, so that particular upwind States were not re-\nquired to reduce their own emissions, Texas would have \nbeen required to make up the difference necessary to \nattain the NAAQS in Galveston. \nThat example likewise illustrates that EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval action was \u201cbased on\u201d its nationwide determina-\ntions.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regarding \nthe updated modeling data and appropriate threshold \ndrove EPA\u2019s conclusions regarding the linkages among \nall States.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regard-\ning relative contributions drove EPA\u2019s conclusions re-\ngarding whether a State had adequately analyzed its \n\u201csignificant contribution.\u201d  And application of EPA\u2019s de-\ntermination regarding relevant emissions-reduction \nmeasures drove EPA\u2019s conclusions as to whether state \nplans must incorporate additional measures to address \nsignificant contributions.  Those determinations were \nessential to EPA\u2019s reasoning in disapproving the state \nplans.   \nThe Sixth Circuit recently concluded that EPA\u2019s de-\ncision to rely on updated modeling and the 1% contribu-\ntion threshold was arbitrary and capricious, and the \ncourt vacated EPA\u2019s disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on \nthat basis.  Kentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447, 473 (2024); \nsee id. at 467-471.  Although the Sixth Circuit rejected \nthe government\u2019s argument that venue for the chal-\nlenge lay in the D.C. Circuit, see id. at 457-467, the \n \n6 See EPA, Air Quality Modeling Technical Support Document: \n2015 Ozone NAAQS C-2-C-3, D-2, https://perma.cc/Z955-CHD7.   \n\n38 \n \ncourt\u2019s merits analysis logically implies that the chal-\nlenged disapproval action is \u201cbased on\u201d the nationwide \ndeterminations.  If (as the Sixth Circuit held) judicial \ninvalidation of the relevant determinations provided a \nsufficient basis for finding the final action itself to be \n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-\nwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), then the determinations are properly \nviewed as a \u201cnecessary logical condition\u201d of the action, \nSafeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the requisite causal relation-\nship exists.7   \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like the one at issue here to be \nreviewable in the D.C. Circuit.   \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977).  Parties \nfaced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \u201cthe ap-\npropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a final \naction pertaining to state implementation plans submit-\n \n7 EPA argued in Kentucky that the possible invalidity of particu-\nlar agency determinations would be \u201charmless\u201d because the agency \nwould have disapproved Kentucky\u2019s plan even without those deter-\nminations.  See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 471.  The Sixth Circuit re-\njected that argument.  See id. at 471-472.  In any event, other na-\ntionwide EPA determinations described above (see pp. 34-36, su-\npra), and the four specified nationwide determinations taken to-\ngether, indisputably were a but-for cause of EPA\u2019s decision to dis-\napprove the 21 state plans. \n\n39 \n \nted by multiple States spanning multiple judicial cir-\ncuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved or disapproved (in whole or in part) numerous \nstate implementation plans, based on the agency\u2019s de-\nterminations that the plan submission and attainment \ndeadlines for certain pollutants should be extended, giv-\ning States more time to adopt the necessary control \nmeasures.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. \nEPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (per cu-\nriam); 37 Fed. Reg. 10,842 (May 31, 1972). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \npossible inconsistent and delayed results on the merits, \ncan only serve to frustrate the strong Congressional in-\nterest in improving the environment.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 495 \n(1972) (per curiam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explain-\ning that \u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \n\u201cinvolve facts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; \nrather, all concern uniform determinations of nation-\nwide effect made by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \n\n40 \n \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \n\n41 \n \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses an individual State\u2014including by assessing its \nimplementation plan\u2014judicial review of the action may \nimplicate national concerns.  After considering the com-\npeting viewpoints expressed by ACUS and Frick as to \nthe proper means of resolving those national issues, \nCongress opted to authorize uniform resolution by \nproviding a mechanism for exclusive D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary reasoning would render the \u201cna-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \npractically insignificant \nIn arguing that EPA did not make any determina-\ntions of nationwide scope or effect, petitioners attempt \nto limit the relevant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s ul-\ntimate decision.  Petitioners further focus on the State-\nspecific circumstances that EPA also considered in the \ncourse of assessing the various implementation plans.  \nPetitioners\u2019 approach is inconsistent with the statutory \ntext and would severely undercut the intended reach of \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Under the correct in-\nterpretation of the statute, that prong has both mean-\ningful reach and meaningful limits, each designed to \nfurther Congress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. \nCircuit those challenges that are likely to raise issues of \nnational importance.   \na. Petitioners contend that, for an EPA action to \nqualify for D.C. Circuit review under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong, the relevant nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d \nmust be the \u201c\u200a\u2018ultimate decision\u2019\u200a\u201d of the final action, such \nthat the court should ask whether the \u201c\u200a\u2018final action\u2019 has \na \u2018nationwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d   State Br. 41 (citations \nomitted); see Industry Br. 47-49.  That argument would \neliminate the statute\u2019s distinction between the final \u201cac-\n\n42 \n \ntion\u201d and the relevant \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it would ul-\ntimately render Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong mean-\ningless.   \nIn applying the first two prongs of Section 7607(b)(1), \nthe Court must consider whether EPA\u2019s disapproval ac-\ntion itself is nationally applicable or instead is locally or \nregionally applicable.  Application of the third prong, by \ncontrast, does not turn on the nature of EPA\u2019s ultimate \naction disapproving the various state plans.  Rather, the \nthird prong potentially applies only if the Court finds \nthe disapproval action itself to be \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d and that prong\u2019s applicability depends on \nEPA\u2019s stated reasons for disapproving the state plans.  \nThe methodological determinations identified above \ngoverned EPA\u2019s analysis of state implementation plans \nacross the country and ultimately affected the legal ob-\nligations of upwind and downwind States nationally.  \nSee pp. 34-37, supra.  And because EPA applied those \ndeterminations to each of the 21 state plan submissions, \nEPA\u2019s finding that the disapproval was based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect remains valid, \nwhether the relevant agency action is viewed as the sin-\ngle combined disapproval action or instead as 21 State-\nspecific disapprovals.  Contra Industry Br. 49-51.   \nThe history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong fur-\nther supports an interpretation that distinguishes be-\ntween EPA\u2019s final \u201caction\u201d and the agency\u2019s underlying \n\u201cdetermination[s].\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In amending \nthe venue provision to incorporate that prong, Congress \nadopted the recommendation of EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel Frick.  Frick cited the Natural Resources De-\nfense Council litigation, in which EPA had acted on var-\nious state plans while granting \u201ctwo-year extensions of \nthe date for attainment of national ambient air quality \n\n43 \n \nstandards in a number of metropolitan areas.\u201d  41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,769.  There, the relevant determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect were EPA\u2019s decisions to ex-\ntend compliance deadlines, not the agency\u2019s ultimate \napproval or disapproval of the various state plans.  See \npp. 38-40, supra.   \nPetitioners\u2019 conflation of the relevant \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d and the final action would also drain Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong of any practical significance.  \nAs explained, that prong potentially applies only to \nEPA actions that are locally or regionally applicable, ra-\nther than nationally applicable.  But if the relevant de-\ntermination were essentially equivalent to the final ac-\ntion, it is difficult to imagine an action that would not be \nnationally applicable under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first \nprong, but that would qualify as nationwide in scope or \neffect.  Petitioners argue (State Br. 39, 41; Industry Br. \n46-47) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong should be \nread narrowly because it establishes an exception to a \ngeneral rule of regional-circuit review of locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions.  But \u201cthis Court has made \nclear that statutory exceptions are to be read fairly, not \nnarrowly, for they \u2018are no less part of Congress\u2019s work \nthan its rules and standards\u2014and all are worthy of a \ncourt\u2019s respect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  HollyFrontier Cheyenne Ref., LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, 395-396 (2021) (ci-\ntation omitted). \nFairly read, the plain text of the third prong does not \nlimit the relevant determination to the \u201cultimate dispo-\nsition\u201d or otherwise equate it to the final action under \nreview.  Rather, the statute distinguishes between the \nchallenged EPA action itself and the agency\u2019s stated \nreasons for taking that action.  The third prong reflects \nCongress\u2019s recognition that centralized review of EPA\u2019s \n\n44 \n \nnationwide legal or policy judgments may be appropri-\nate even when such judgments are challenged in a peti-\ntion for review of a local agency action.  To the extent \nthe Court views the disapproval action as locally or re-\ngionally applicable, that principle is directly implicated \nhere.   \nb. Petitioners assert (State Br. 47-51; Industry Br. \n51-54) that the disapproval action falls outside Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong because the States\u2019 plan sub-\nmissions and EPA\u2019s analysis had State-specific aspects.  \nBut the State-specific analyses petitioners highlight \nlargely reflect the application of the nationwide deter-\nminations to each State\u2019s circumstances.  For example, \npetitioners note (State Br. 48; Industry Br. 51) Utah\u2019s \nargument during the administrative proceedings that it \nneed not reduce its contributions to Colorado-based re-\nceptors because its contribution was minimal in compar-\nison to those of other emissions sources.  But EPA re-\njected that argument\u2014made by numerous other States \n\u2014based on EPA\u2019s nationwide determination that the \nrelative magnitude of contributions from other sources \ndoes not relieve States of their Good Neighbor obliga-\ntions.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9378-9379.  Similarly, petitioners \nemphasize (State Br. 47; Industry Br. 52) Oklahoma\u2019s \nargument that existing emission-reduction measures \nwere sufficient to meet its Good Neighbor obligations.  \nBut again, many other States made the same argument, \nand EPA concluded that no linked State could meet its \nGood Neighbor obligations simply by relying on exist-\ning control measures or anticipated reductions that are \nnot incorporated into enforceable state plans.  See 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9343, 9377.   \nIn treating EPA\u2019s need to consider State-specific cir-\ncumstances as controlling the venue inquiry, petitioners \n\n45 \n \nwould effectively limit D.C. Circuit venue under Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong to review of EPA actions that \nare based solely on determinations of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Nothing in the statutory text supports that \napproach.  Where Congress intended to require such a \nlimitation, it said so explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (providing an exception to the statute\u2019s 60-\nday filing window where the \u201cpetition is based solely on \ngrounds arising after\u201d that time period expires) (em-\nphasis added); cf. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in \nother statutes, [Congress] could have added \u2018solely\u2019 to \nindicate that actions taken \u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence \nof multiple factors do not violate the law.\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nOnce again, petitioners\u2019 approach would render the \n\u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d prong practically insignifi-\ncant and is inconsistent with the statutory history.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  By its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong applies only to actions that are \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can \nbe expected to rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Yet on petitioners\u2019 \nview, EPA\u2019s consideration of such circumstances is suf-\nficient to preclude D.C. Circuit review.  And as ex-\nplained above (see pp. 38-41, supra), Congress enacted \nSection 7607(b)(1) in its current form after then- \nGeneral Counsel Frick specifically highlighted the fact \nthat EPA\u2019s approval of plans for individual States\u2014\nwhich necessarily rest at least in part on State-specific \ncircumstances\u2014can also raise issues of national signifi-\ncance for which D.C. Circuit review is appropriate.  See \n41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  Petitioners\u2019 interpretation thus \ncontravenes Congress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review \nof national issues in the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing ef-\n\n46 \n \nficient resolution of those issues, even when the actions \nalso address local or regional concerns.   \nc. Petitioners contend (State Br. 54; Industry Br. \n55) that adopting EPA\u2019s interpretation would allow \nD.C. Circuit venue for challenges to every locally or re-\ngionally applicable EPA action.  That is incorrect.  The \nstatutory text includes significant limitations that pre-\nvent that result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 31-32, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 33, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already explained, \nibid., that causation requirement is satisfied here\u2014but \nit will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \n\n47 \n \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments  \nreflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the nation-\nwide rule, policy, or interpretation itself is likely to be \ncalled into question in any judicial challenge to the EPA \naction, routing such challenges to the D.C. Circuit \nserves important interests in judicial efficiency and na-\ntionwide uniformity.  That is particularly so if the rele-\nvant EPA determination is intended to govern future \nagency actions across the country.  But where the valid-\nity of the general rule or policy appears to be settled, \nsuch that any judicial challenges to the action are likely \nto focus on the application of the general pronounce-\nment to discrete local facts, those interests are inappo-\nsite. \nHere, EPA made each of the relevant determinations \nin the disapproval action itself, after considering com-\nments disputing their validity.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at \n9365-9367, 9370-9375, 9376-9378.  While the determina-\ntions may be consistent with EPA\u2019s prior implementa-\ntion of other NAAQS, EPA did not simply apply exist-\ning rules or standards; rather, its determinations re-\nsolved controversies over specific methodological issues \nthat were vigorously contested.  EPA\u2019s conclusions sup-\nporting the disapproval action therefore are properly \n\n48 \n \nviewed as \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d within the meaning of Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1).   \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \npp. 33-34, supra.  For example, EPA may consider \nwhether any petitions for review of a particular action \nwould likely contest EPA determinations of national \nconcern, or instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s under-\nstanding of local or regional circumstances.  For EPA \nactions in the latter category, the agency may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action.   \nd. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that are subject to D.C. Circuit review, while al-\nlowing efficient and uniform resolution of disputed is-\nsues of national significance.  By contrast, petitioners\u2019 \ninterpretation would limit D.C. Circuit review of locally \nor regionally applicable EPA actions to a vanishingly \nsmall category.  Embracing petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nwould lead to the very problems Congress sought to \navoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue provision to include \nthe nationwide-scope-or-effect language.   \nThis case is illustrative.  Because multiple circuits \nhave declined to transfer challenges to the D.C. Circuit, \n\n49 \n \nEPA has been litigating substantially similar challenges \nto the disapproval action in eight courts of appeals.  Ra-\nther than focusing their challenges on State-specific \nfindings that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval of par-\nticular state plans, the petitioners in all of those cases \nhave primarily contested the legality of the same core \ndeterminations that EPA adopted and applied nation-\nwide.   \nConsideration of the same basic legal challenges by \nmultiple circuits wastes judicial resources and creates a \nsubstantial risk of inconsistent merits rulings.  Such \nrulings would produce a fragmented Good Neighbor \nprogram for ozone, subjecting similarly situated States \nto different regulatory burdens based on the circuits in \nwhich those States are located, and complicating EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of the \u201coverlapping and interwoven link-\nages between upwind and downwind States\u201d that char-\nacterize the ozone problem.  EPA v. EME Homer City \nGeneration, L. P., 572 U.S. 489, 496-497 (2014).  Such a \nresult is contrary to the principles animating the Good \nNeighbor Provision, and to Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose \nof ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of issues with \nnational significance.  If this Court endorses petition-\ners\u2019 venue analysis, future EPA actions similar to the \ndisapproval action here can be expected to spawn litiga-\ntion in numerous courts of appeals, with a consequent \nwaste of judicial resources and a heightened risk of in-\nconsistent outcomes.  Nothing in the statutory text re-\nquires that result, and the Court should reject it. \n \n \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe order of the court of appeals should be affirmed.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nJEANHEE HONG \nROSEMARY H.

Air \nquality criteria for an air pollutant shall accurately re-\nflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating \nthe kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public \nhealth or welfare which may be expected from the pres-\nence of such pollutant in the ambient air, in varying \nquantities.  The criteria for an air pollutant, to the ex-\ntent practicable, shall include information on\u2014 \n\n2a \n \n \n(A) \nthose variable factors (including atmos-\npheric conditions) which of themselves or in combina-\ntion with other factors may alter the effects on public \nhealth or welfare of such air pollutant; \n \n(B) \nthe types of air pollutants which, when pre-\nsent in the atmosphere, may interact with such pollu-\ntant to produce an adverse effect on public health or \nwelfare; and \n \n(C) \nany known or anticipated adverse effects on \nwelfare. \n(b) \nIssuance by Administrator of information on air pol-\nlution control techniques; standing consulting com-\nmittees for air pollutants; establishment; member-\nship \n(1) Simultaneously with the issuance of criteria un-\nder subsection (a), the Administrator shall, after consul-\ntation with appropriate advisory committees and Fed-\neral departments and agencies, issue to the States and \nappropriate air pollution control agencies information \non air pollution control techniques, which information \nshall include data relating to the cost of installation and \noperation, energy requirements, emission reduction \nbenefits, and environmental impact of the emission con-\ntrol technology.  Such information shall include such \ndata as are available on available technology and alter-\nnative methods of prevention and control of air pollu-\ntion.  Such information shall also include data on alter-\nnative fuels, processes, and operating methods which \nwill result in elimination or significant reduction of emis-\nsions. \n(2) In order to assist in the development of infor-\nmation on pollution control techniques, the Administra-\n\n3a \n \ntor may establish a standing consulting committee for \neach air pollutant included in a list published pursuant \nto subsection (a)(1), which shall be comprised of techni-\ncally qualified individuals representative of State and lo-\ncal governments, industry, and the academic commu-\nnity.  Each such committee shall submit, as appropri-\nate, to the Administrator information related to that re-\nquired by paragraph (1). \n(c) \nReview, modification, and reissuance of criteria or \ninformation \nThe Administrator shall from time to time review, \nand, as appropriate, modify, and reissue any criteria or \ninformation on control techniques issued pursuant to \nthis section.  Not later than six months after August 7, \n1977, the Administrator shall revise and reissue criteria \nrelating to concentrations of NO2 over such period (not \nmore than three hours) as he deems appropriate.  Such \ncriteria shall include a discussion of nitric and nitrous \nacids, nitrites, nitrates, nitrosamines, and other carcino-\ngenic and potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides \nof nitrogen. \n(d) \nPublication in Federal Register; availability of cop-\nies for general public \nThe issuance of air quality criteria and information \non air pollution control techniques shall be announced in \nthe Federal Register and copies shall be made available \nto the general public. \n(e) \nTransportation planning and guidelines \nThe Administrator shall, after consultation with the \nSecretary of Transportation, and after providing public \nnotice and opportunity for comment, and with State and \nlocal officials, within nine months after November 15, \n\n4a \n \n1990,1 and periodically thereafter as necessary to main-\ntain a continuous transportation-air quality planning \nprocess, update the June 1978 Transportation-Air Qual-\nity Planning Guidelines and publish guidance on the de-\nvelopment and implementation of transportation and \nother measures necessary to demonstrate and maintain \nattainment of national ambient air quality standards.  \nSuch guidelines shall include information on\u2014 \n \n(1) \nmethods to identify and evaluate alternative \nplanning and control activities; \n \n(2) \nmethods of reviewing plans on a regular ba-\nsis as conditions change or new information is pre-\nsented; \n \n(3) \nidentification of funds and other resources \nnecessary to implement the plan, including inter-\nagency agreements on providing such funds and re-\nsources; \n \n(4) \nmethods to assure participation by the pub-\nlic in all phases of the planning process; and \n \n(5) \nsuch other methods as the Administrator \ndetermines necessary to carry out a continuous plan-\nning process. \n(f\u200a) \nInformation regarding processes, procedures, and \nmethods to reduce or control pollutants in transpor-\ntation; reduction of mobile source related pollu-\ntants; reduction of impact on public health \n(1) The Administrator shall publish and make avail-\nable to appropriate Federal, State, and local environ-\nmental and transportation agencies not later than one \n \n1  See Codification note below. \n\n5a \n \nyear after November 15, 1990, and from time to time \nthereafter\u2014 \n \n(A) \ninformation prepared, as appropriate, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Transportation, \nand after providing public notice and opportunity for \ncomment, regarding the formulation and emission re-\nduction potential of transportation control measures \nrelated to criteria pollutants and their precursors, in-\ncluding, but not limited to\u2014 \n \n \n(i) \nprograms for improved public transit; \n \n(ii) \nrestriction of certain roads or lanes to, or \nconstruction of such roads or lanes for use by, pas-\nsenger buses or high occupancy vehicles; \n \n(iii) employer-based transportation manage-\nment plans, including incentives; \n \n(iv) trip-reduction ordinances; \n \n(v) \ntraffic flow improvement programs that \nachieve emission reductions; \n \n(vi) fringe and transportation corridor park-\ning facilities serving multiple occupancy vehicle \nprograms or transit service; \n \n(vii) programs to limit or restrict vehicle use \nin downtown areas or other areas of emission con-\ncentration particularly during periods of peak use; \n \n(viii) programs for the provision of all forms of \nhigh-occupancy, shared-ride services; \n \n(ix) programs to limit portions of road sur-\nfaces or certain sections of the metropolitan area \nto the use of non-motorized vehicles or pedestrian \nuse, both as to time and place; \n\n6a \n \n \n(x) \nprograms for secure bicycle storage facil-\nities and other facilities, including bicycle lanes, \nfor the convenience and protection of bicyclists, in \nboth public and private areas; \n \n(xi) programs to control extended idling of ve-\nhicles; \n \n(xii) programs to reduce motor vehicle emis-\nsions, consistent with subchapter II, which are \ncaused by extreme cold start conditions; \n \n(xiii) employer-sponsored programs to permit \nflexible work schedules; \n \n(xiv) programs and ordinances to facilitate \nnon-automobile travel, provision and utilization of \nmass transit, and to generally reduce the need for \nsingle-occupant vehicle travel, as part of transpor-\ntation planning and development efforts of a local-\nity, including programs and ordinances applicable \nto new shopping centers, special events, and other \ncenters of vehicle activity; \n \n(xv) programs for new construction and major \nreconstructions of paths, tracks or areas solely for \nthe use by pedestrian or other non-motorized \nmeans of transportation when economically feasi-\nble and in the public interest.  For purposes of \nthis clause, the Administrator shall also consult \nwith the Secretary of the Interior; and \n \n(xvi) program to encourage the voluntary re-\nmoval from use and the marketplace of pre-1980 \n\n7a \n \nmodel year light duty vehicles and pre-1980 model \nlight duty trucks.2  \n \n(B) \ninformation on additional methods or strat-\negies that will contribute to the reduction of mobile \nsource related pollutants during periods in which any \nprimary ambient air quality standard will be ex-\nceeded and during episodes for which an air pollution \nalert, warning, or emergency has been declared; \n \n(C) \ninformation on other measures which may \nbe employed to reduce the impact on public health or \nprotect the health of sensitive or susceptible individ-\nuals or groups; and \n \n(D) \ninformation on the extent to which any pro-\ncess, procedure, or method to reduce or control such \nair pollutant may cause an increase in the emissions \nor formation of any other pollutant. \n(2) In publishing such information the Administra-\ntor shall also include an assessment of\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe relative effectiveness of such processes, \nprocedures, and methods; \n \n(B) \nthe potential effect of such processes, proce-\ndures, and methods on transportation systems and \nthe provision of transportation services; and \n \n(C) \nthe environmental, energy, and economic \nimpact of such processes, procedures, and methods. \n(g) \nAssessment of risks to ecosystems \nThe Administrator may assess the risks to ecosys-\ntems from exposure to criteria air pollutants (as identi-\n \n2  So in original.  The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n8a \n \nfied by the Administrator in the Administrator\u2019s sole \ndiscretion). \n(h) RACT/BACT/LAER clearinghouse \nThe Administrator shall make information regarding \nemission control technology available to the States and \nto the general public through a central database.  Such \ninformation shall include all control technology infor-\nmation received pursuant to State plan provisions re-\nquiring permits for sources, including operating permits \nfor existing sources. \n \n2. \n42 U.S.C. 7409 provides: \nNational primary and secondary ambient air quality \nstandards \n(a) \nPromulgation \n(1) The Administrator\u2014 \n \n(A) \nwithin 30 days after December 31, 1970, \nshall publish proposed regulations prescribing a na-\ntional primary ambient air quality standard and a na-\ntional secondary ambient air quality standard for \neach air pollutant for which air quality criteria have \nbeen issued prior to such date; and \n \n(B) \nafter a reasonable time for interested per-\nsons to submit written comments thereon (but no \nlater than 90 days after the initial publication of such \nproposed standards) shall by regulation promulgate \nsuch proposed national primary and secondary ambi-\nent air quality standards with such modifications as \nhe deems appropriate. \n\n9a \n \n(2) With respect to any air pollutant for which air \nquality criteria are issued after December 31, 1970, the \nAdministrator shall publish, simultaneously with the is-\nsuance of such criteria and information, proposed na-\ntional primary and secondary ambient air quality stand-\nards for any such pollutant.  The procedure provided \nfor in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall apply to \nthe promulgation of such standards. \n(b) \nProtection of public health and welfare \n(1) National primary ambient air quality standards, \nprescribed under subsection (a) shall be ambient air \nquality standards the attainment and maintenance of \nwhich in the judgment of the Administrator, based on \nsuch criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, \nare requisite to protect the public health.  Such pri-\nmary standards may be revised in the same manner as \npromulgated. \n(2) Any national secondary ambient air quality \nstandard prescribed under subsection (a) shall specify a \nlevel of air quality the attainment and maintenance of \nwhich in the judgment of the Administrator, based on \nsuch criteria, is requisite to protect the public welfare \nfrom any known or anticipated adverse effects associ-\nated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambi-\nent air.  Such secondary standards may be revised in \nthe same manner as promulgated. \n(c) \nNational primary ambient air quality standard for \nnitrogen dioxide \nThe Administrator shall, not later than one year after \nAugust 7, 1977, promulgate a national primary ambient \nair quality standard for NO2 concentrations over a pe-\nriod of not more than 3 hours unless, based on the crite-\n\n10a \n \nria issued under section 7408(c) of this title, he finds \nthat there is no significant evidence that such a standard \nfor such a period is requisite to protect public health. \n(d) \nReview and revision of criteria and standards; inde-\npendent scientific review committee; appointment; \nadvisory functions \n(1) Not later than December 31, 1980, and at five-\nyear intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall com-\nplete a thorough review of the criteria published un-\nder section 7408 of this title and the national ambient \nair quality standards promulgated under this section \nand shall make such revisions in such criteria and stand-\nards and promulgate such new standards as may be ap-\npropriate in accordance with section 7408 of this ti-\ntle and subsection (b) of this section.  The Administra-\ntor may review and revise criteria or promulgate new \nstandards earlier or more frequently than required un-\nder this paragraph. \n(2)(A)  The Administrator shall appoint an inde-\npendent scientific review committee composed of seven \nmembers including at least one member of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, one physician, and one person rep-\nresenting State air pollution control agencies. \n(B) Not later than January 1, 1980, and at five-year \nintervals thereafter, the committee referred to in sub-\nparagraph (A) shall complete a review of the criteria \npublished under section 7408 of this title and the na-\ntional primary and secondary ambient air quality stand-\nards promulgated under this section and shall recom-\nmend to the Administrator any new national ambient air \nquality standards and revisions of existing criteria and \n\n11a \n \nstandards as may be appropriate under section 7408 of \nthis title and subsection (b) of this section. \n(C) Such committee shall also (i) advise the Admin-\nistrator of areas in which additional knowledge is re-\nquired to appraise the adequacy and basis of existing, \nnew, or revised national ambient air quality standards, \n(ii) describe the research efforts necessary to provide \nthe required information, (iii) advise the Administrator \non the relative contribution to air pollution concentra-\ntions of natural as well as anthropogenic activity, and \n(iv) advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, \nwelfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may re-\nsult from various strategies for attainment and mainte-\nnance of such national ambient air quality standards. \n \n3. \n42 U.S.C. 7410 provides: \nState implementation plans for national primary and sec-\nondary ambient air quality standards \n(a) \nAdoption of plan by State; submission to Adminis-\ntrator; content of plan; revision; new sources; indi-\nrect source review program; supplemental or inter-\nmittent control systems \n(1) Each State shall, after reasonable notice and \npublic hearings, adopt and submit to the Administrator, \nwithin 3 years (or such shorter period as the Adminis-\ntrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a na-\ntional primary ambient air quality standard (or any re-\nvision thereof\u200a) under section 7409 of this title for any \nair pollutant, a plan which provides for implementation, \nmaintenance, and enforcement of such primary stand-\nard in each air quality control region (or portion thereof\u200a) \nwithin such State.  In addition, such State shall adopt \n\n12a \n \nand submit to the Administrator (either as a part of a \nplan submitted under the preceding sentence or sepa-\nrately) within 3 years (or such shorter period as the Ad-\nministrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a \nnational ambient air quality secondary standard (or re-\nvision thereof\u200a), a plan which provides for implementa-\ntion, maintenance, and enforcement of such secondary \nstandard in each air quality control region (or portion \nthereof\u200a) within such State.  Unless a separate public \nhearing is provided, each State shall consider its plan \nimplementing such secondary standard at the hearing \nrequired by the first sentence of this paragraph. \n(2) Each implementation plan submitted by a State \nunder this chapter shall be adopted by the State after \nreasonable notice and public hearing.  Each such plan \nshall\u2014 \n \n(A) \ninclude enforceable emission limitations and \nother control measures, means, or techniques (in-\ncluding economic incentives such as fees, marketable \npermits, and auctions of emissions rights), as well as \nschedules and timetables for compliance, as may be \nnecessary or appropriate to meet the applicable re-\nquirements of this chapter;

The Administrator \nshall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his au-\nthority under the previous sentence with respect to any \ndeficiency referred to in section 7509(a) of this title to \nensure that, during the 24-month period following the \nfinding, disapproval, or determination referred to \nin section 7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not ap-\nplied on a statewide basis where one or more political \nsubdivisions covered by the applicable implementation \nplan are principally responsible for such deficiency. \n(n) Savings clauses \n(1) Existing plan provisions \n \nAny provision of any applicable implementation \nplan that was approved or promulgated by the Ad-\nministrator pursuant to this section as in effect be-\nfore November 15, 1990, shall remain in effect as part \nof such applicable implementation plan, except to the \nextent that a revision to such provision is approved \nor promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to \nthis chapter. \n(2) Attainment dates \n \nFor any area not designated nonattainment, any \nplan or plan revision submitted or required to be sub-\nmitted by a State\u2014 \n \n(A) \nin response to the promulgation or revi-\nsion of a national primary ambient air quality \nstandard in effect on November 15, 1990, or \n\n33a \n \n \n(B) \nin response to a finding of substantial in-\nadequacy under subsection (a)(2) (as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990), \nshall provide for attainment of the national primary \nambient air quality standards within 3 years of No-\nvember 15, 1990, or within 5 years of issuance of such \nfinding of substantial inadequacy, whichever is later. \n(3) Retention of construction moratorium in certain \nareas \n \nIn the case of an area to which, immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990, the prohibition on construction \nor modification of major stationary sources prescribed \nin subsection (a)(2)(I) (as in effect immediately be-\nfore November 15, 1990) applied by virtue of a find-\ning of the Administrator that the State containing \nsuch area had not submitted an implementation plan \nmeeting the requirements of section 7502(b)(6) of \nthis title (relating to establishment of a permit pro-\ngram) (as in effect immediately before November 15, \n1990) or 7502(a)(1) of this title (to the extent such re-\nquirements relate to provision for attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990, no major sta-\ntionary source of the relevant air pollutant or pollu-\ntants shall be constructed or modified in such area \nuntil the Administrator finds that the plan for such \narea meets the applicable requirements of section \n7502(c)(5) of this title (relating to permit programs) \nor subpart 5 of part D (relating to attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur dioxide), respectively. \n\n34a \n \n(o) \nIndian tribes \nIf an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to \nthe Administrator pursuant to section 7601(d) of this ti-\ntle, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the \nprovisions for review set forth in this section for State \nplans, except as otherwise provided by regulation prom-\nulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this title.  \nWhen such plan becomes effective in accordance with \nthe regulations promulgated under section 7601(d) of \nthis title, the plan shall become applicable to all areas \n(except as expressly provided otherwise in the plan) lo-\ncated within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, \nnotwithstanding the issuance of any patent and includ-\ning rights-of-way running through the reservation. \n(p) \nReports \nAny State shall submit, according to such schedule as \nthe Administrator may prescribe, such reports as the \nAdministrator may require relating to emission reduc-\ntions, vehicle miles traveled, congestion levels, and any \nother information the Administrator may deem neces-\nsary to assess the development4 effectiveness, need for \nrevision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision \nrequired under this chapter. \n \n4. 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) provides: \nAdministrative proceedings and judicial review \n(b) \nJudicial review \n(1) A petition for review of action of the Administra-\ntor in promulgating any national primary or secondary \n \n4  So in original.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case remains stable following the latest observation, as it was an internal reasoning step that did not introduce new external information. My beliefs are still firmly rooted in the analysis of the petitioners' brief on the merits.\n\nThe core of the case is the statutory interpretation of the Clean Air Act's judicial review provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). My understanding of the petitioners' position is now quite detailed:\n1.  **Textual/Structural Argument:** Their primary claim is that the statute's plain language assigns review of actions on State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to the appropriate regional circuit court because they are inherently \"locally or regionally applicable.\" They argue that the EPA's disapproval of a single state's plan fits this description, and the EPA cannot unilaterally change this congressionally mandated venue by simply bundling multiple, distinct local actions into one Federal Register notice.\n2.  **Key Precedent/Signal:** A crucial piece of evidence supporting their position is the D.C. Circuit opinion in *American Road & Transportation Builders Ass'n v. EPA*, authored by then-Judge Kavanaugh, which described action on a single SIP as the \"prototypical 'locally or regionally applicable' action.\" This provides a strong signal regarding how at least one Justice views the fundamental nature of the EPA action at issue.\n3.  **Rebuttal to the Exception:** Petitioners preemptively argue against the D.C. Circuit exception for actions \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\" They contend that the *basis* for each disapproval was state-specific data, and the EPA's use of a \"consistent analysis\" is a matter of administrative convenience, not a single, substantive nationwide determination as required by the statute.\n4.  **Procedural Context:** The existence of a deep circuit split (Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits vs. the Tenth Circuit below) confirms that the legal question is substantial and was ripe for Supreme Court review.\n\nThe recent observation, which was a self-reflection on my knowledge state, did not alter these beliefs but rather highlighted the most significant area of uncertainty: the EPA's counterarguments. My understanding of the case is currently one-sided. To accurately predict the outcome, I must understand how the EPA justifies its position that this bundled disapproval constitutes a single action that is either \"nationally applicable\" or \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\" My beliefs will remain in this state until I can analyze the arguments presented in the respondent's brief.",

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal arguments in this case has now become substantially more complete and balanced. The previous observation left me with a detailed understanding of the petitioners' position but a significant gap regarding the EPA's counterarguments. The receipt of the \"Brief for the Federal Respondents\" has filled this gap, providing a clear, two-pronged justification for D.C. Circuit jurisdiction. My beliefs now encompass the arguments from both sides.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable Belief):** My belief that the petitioners' case rests on a textual and structural interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is unchanged. They argue that the disapproval of a single State Implementation Plan (SIP) is the \"prototypical 'locally or regionally applicable' action,\" a view supported by then-Judge Kavanaugh's opinion in *American Road & Transportation Builders Ass'n v. EPA*. They contend the EPA cannot unilaterally create D.C. Circuit jurisdiction by simply bundling these distinct local actions into a single Federal Register notice for administrative convenience.\n\n2.  **Respondent's First Counterargument (New Belief):** I now understand the EPA's primary argument is that the disapproval rule is, in fact, **\"nationally applicable.\"**\n    *   **Focus on the Action, Not the Effect:** The EPA argues the proper focus is on the *nature of the agency's action*, not its ultimate effect on any single state. The action was a single final rule that simultaneously disapproved plans for 21 states across the country.\n    *   **Uniformity and Scope:** This action applied a \"uniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide analytical methods\" to address the inherently national problem of interstate ozone transport. The EPA contends that this single, comprehensive rulemaking, addressing a problem that spans multiple judicial circuits, fits the definition of a \"nationally applicable\" final action.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Second Counterargument (New Belief):** As an alternative, the EPA argues that the action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit because it is **\"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\"**\n    *   **The \"Determinations\":** The EPA identifies the specific \"determinations\" that formed the basis for the disapprovals. These include:\n        *   The use of a nationwide four-step framework for assessing Good Neighbor obligations.\n        *   The reliance on nationwide air quality modeling to identify linked upwind and downwind states.\n        *   The decision to apply a uniform 1% contribution threshold to screen for significance across all states.\n        *   The consistent, nationwide rejection of common arguments made by multiple states regarding their contributions.\n    *   **Statutory Trigger:** The EPA asserts that because these nationwide determinations were the foundation for disapproving the individual state plans, the statutory exception for D.C. Circuit review is triggered. They also explicitly published this finding in the final rule, satisfying the statute's procedural requirement. They argue that to hold otherwise would render this part of the statute \"practically insignificant.\"\n\n4.  **The Central Legal Dispute:** The case now clearly revolves around a direct clash of statutory interpretation. It is a conflict between the petitioners' focus on the individual, state-specific nature of a SIP disapproval and the EPA's focus on the consolidated, methodologically uniform nature of its multi-state rulemaking action. The key question for the Court will be whether \"nationally applicable\" refers to the geographic scope of the rule's *effects* (favoring petitioners) or the character and methodology of the *agency action itself* (favoring the EPA). The EPA's alternative argument about the \"basis\" of the action provides a strong fallback position, forcing the Court to define what constitutes a \"determination of nationwide scope or effect.\"\n\nMy uncertainty has shifted from a lack of information to the legal question itself. I now have a comprehensive view of the legal battleground and can analyze how different judicial philosophies might approach the competing interpretations of \u00a7 7607(b)(1).",

      "eig_reasoning": "My current belief state is mature regarding the direct arguments between the petitioners and the respondent. I have a sharp understanding of the core legal conflict. This action, searching for amicus briefs in support of the petitioners, is the logical next step to broaden my understanding. \n\nTask EIG (0.8): The high task EIG is justified because amicus briefs will provide crucial information beyond the primary parties' arguments. I expect to gain insight into: 1) The breadth of support for the petitioners' position, particularly from other states, which would amplify the federalism and state sovereignty arguments. This is a powerful signal for certain justices. 2) Novel legal or policy arguments that the primary parties may not have focused on, such as the practical, economic, or administrative consequences of the EPA's approach. 3) Reinforcement of the petitioners' key claims, potentially with new empirical data or historical context, which could make those claims more persuasive. This moves my analysis from a simple summary of arguments to a weighted assessment of their likely influence.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): The high design EIG stems from this action's utility in refining my general predictive model. It directly tests the hypothesis that analyzing amicus briefs is a critical step for accurate prediction, even after the main briefs are understood. By observing what new information these briefs provide (or fail to provide), I can learn to better weigh the importance of amicus support in statutory interpretation cases, differentiate the influence of state amici vs. industry amici, and optimize the sequence of document analysis in future cases. This is a fundamental test of a core component of SCOTUS prediction strategy.\n\nOverall, this action is highly valuable as it transitions my analysis from the core legal dispute to the broader coalition and persuasive context surrounding the case, which is essential for a nuanced final prediction.",

It \nrepresents approximately 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than 3 mil-\nlion companies and professional organizations of every \nsize, in every industry sector, and from every region of \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto represent the interests of its members in matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nTo that end, the Chamber regularly files amicus curiae \nbriefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues of con-\ncern to the nation\u2019s business community. \nThe Chamber has an interest in maintaining effi-\ncient and predictable mechanisms for judicial review \nof federal agency action.  An important, frequently re-\ncurring, and oft-litigated threshold question in such \ncases is which court or courts are the proper venue for \nchallenges.  All stakeholders\u2014even those whose un-\nderlying interests in the merits of a dispute may be \ndiametrically opposed\u2014have a shared interest in hav-\ning clear and readily administrable rules governing \nthe selection of venue.  Unpredictable and unclear \nvenue rules can lead to wasteful and time-consuming \nthreshold litigation about whether venue is proper, in-\ncreasing the overall cost and uncertainty, and delay-\ning the ultimate resolution, of challenges to agency ac-\ntion. \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, or its counsel, made any monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nThe venue provisions in Section 307(b)(1) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), are significant \nin their own right, as they specify venue for judicial \nreview of a broad range of actions taken by the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air \nAct\u2014actions that, individually and in aggregate, can \nhave significant practical and economic consequences \nfor members of the nation\u2019s business community.  Un-\ncertainty and confusion about the meaning of these \nimportant provisions can have significant negative ef-\nfects\u2014as vividly illustrated by the circumstances and \nlengthy procedural history of the cases under review \nand other related litigation. \nThe Chamber files this brief as amicus curiae in \nsupport of neither party, taking no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases.  Instead, the \nChamber urges the Court to adopt an interpretation \nthat provides clarity and predictability to all stake-\nholders, and minimizes or avoids unnecessary and \nwasteful threshold litigation over the appropriate \nvenue for challenges brought under the Clean Air Act.  \nIn the Chamber\u2019s view, those interests would be best \nserved by an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that is \nfaithful to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory con-\nstruction. \nBy contrast, interests in clarity and predictability \nwould be disserved by a reading that allows the gov-\nernment to unilaterally select (or even manipulate) \nthe proper venue through its choice of formalities, \nsuch as whether to \u201cbundle\u201d together several individ-\nual actions into a single omnibus notice for purposes \nof publication in the Federal Register.  Similarly, \n\n3 \n \ninterests in clarity and predictability would be dis-\nserved by an interpretation that fails to give meaning \nand independent significance to each of the separate \nprovisions in Section 307(b)(1), which provide guid-\nance to litigants by drawing a line between cases that \ncan be brought only in the D.C. Circuit and cases for \nwhich venue lies exclusively in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  The Court should not endorse a reading \nthat would deprive any portion of Section 307(b)(1), in-\ncluding the second sentence addressing cases to be \nbought in the regional circuits, of meaningful inde-\npendent effect.  Such a reading would not comport \nwith the statutory text and would have adverse conse-\nquences for members of the nation\u2019s business commu-\nnity and for other litigants. \n INTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The nation\u2019s businesses, no less than other liti-\ngants, benefit from clarity and predictability in rules \nregarding where and when lawsuits can be brought, \nincluding rules regarding the selection of venue in \nchallenges to federal agency action.  Litigants avoid \nspending time and money litigating threshold issues \nwhen it is clear up front which court should adjudicate \na particular dispute.  Clarity in the articulation of \nvenue principles, in turn, promotes predictability in \ntheir application, enabling private parties to make in-\nformed business and investment decisions and other-\nwise order their affairs.  In short, certainty, transpar-\nency, and predictability regarding where certain types \nof claims will be litigated yield real-world benefits to \nlitigants and other stakeholders. \n\n4 \n \nBy contrast, complexity and uncertainty in the \nrules governing where a case may be brought consume \nvaluable resources as parties litigate the choice of the \nappropriate forum.  In the context of litigation chal-\nlenging federal agency actions, uncertainty regarding \nvenue rules can generate still further inefficiencies, \nsuch as the filing and consideration of protective peti-\ntions in multiple courts, when the law is unclear as to \nwhich court is appropriate, and the preparation and \nconsideration of merits briefs in cases that are ulti-\nmately dismissed for improper venue.  Meanwhile, \nresolution of merits issues is delayed, undermining \nCongress\u2019s decision to expedite challenges to certain \nfederal agency actions by (as here) authorizing direct \nappellate review.  Delay in resolving challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions in administering the Clean Air Act can \nharm all stakeholders, increasing transition and com-\npliance costs for regulated parties, and extending pe-\nriods of uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under \nreview. \nII. \nSection 307(b)(1) specifies that EPA\u2019s nation-\nally applicable actions will be reviewed in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit, while regionally or locally applicable actions will \nbe reviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, unless \nsuch an action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.  Although the Chamber takes no \nposition on the Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, and does not attempt to provide a universal tax-\nonomy of the cases that belong in the D.C. Circuit ver-\nsus regional circuits, this brief offers several interpre-\ntative points that would advance interests of clarity \nand predictability. \n\n5 \n \nFirst, a key textual distinction in Section 307(b)(1) \nis whether a given EPA action is \u201cnationally\u201d versus \n\u201clocally \nor \nregionally\u201d \napplicable. \n 42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  While hard cases for drawing that line \nmay exist, the inquiry should remain focused on the \nsubstance of the actions being taken by EPA, with \nclose attention to the statutory authority pursuant to \nwhich EPA has acted.  That approach follows from the \nstatutory text, which defines venue for different cate-\ngories of cases by cross-referencing substantive provi-\nsions of the Clean Air Act.  Where the substance of an \nEPA action is specific to a particular region or locality, \nthat action should be reviewed in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  Conversely, when the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action is nationally applicable, the case belongs \nin the D.C. Circuit. \nSecond, and relatedly, venue determinations \nshould not turn on formalistic or procedural distinc-\ntions that are disconnected from the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action.  Such an interpretation would open the \ndoor to manipulation, undermining interests in pre-\ndictability and certainty.  It would be improper, there-\nfore, to treat the analysis of venue under Section \n307(b)(1) as affected or even determined by whether \nEPA decides to bundle multiple individual actions into \na single notice for publication in the Federal Register, \nif in fact each individual action pertains to a specific \nlocation.  Allowing such bundling to affect the venue \nanalysis would increase uncertainty and inefficiency \nfor actions that, in substance, are fundamentally local \nor regional in nature.  And it would disserve interests \nin predictability, because regulated parties would \nhave no way of knowing in advance whether EPA \n\n6 \n \nwould combine multiple individual actions (each re-\ngional or local in character) into a single publication \npackage.   \nThird, meaningful effect should be given to each \nseparate part of the venue provisions in Section \n307(b)(1).  Congress took care to identify and distin-\nguish between classes of cases that are always subject \nto review in the D.C. Circuit (first sentence), and clas-\nses of cases that are presumptively subject to review \nin the regional circuits (second sentence).  And Con-\ngress provided a narrow exception to the second sen-\ntence for regional actions that are \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d (third sen-\ntence).  The third sentence should be interpreted in \nlight of that structure and not as a means for overrid-\ning the division in the previous two sentences. \nIII. Applying these principles to the issues before \nthe Court in these cases, a natural starting point is to \nrecognize that the EPA disapprovals of state imple-\nmentation plans challenged in these cases lie in the \nheartland of Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s list of orders reviewa-\nble in the regional circuit courts.  EPA has argued that \nit can effectively channel any case to the D.C. Circuit \nby packaging together multiple individual actions; \nthat argument, however, runs afoul of each of the prin-\nciples discussed above, that interpretation of the \nvenue provisions should focus on the statutory text \nand the substance of EPA\u2019s actions and should give \nmeaningful effect to each sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  \nEPA has also argued that an action is reviewable in \nthe D.C. Circuit under the third sentence of Section \n307(b)(1), so long as EPA identifies some underlying \n\u201clegal and technical determinations\u201d that apply across \n\n7 \n \nstates and that constitute even one among many of the \nbut-for causes of its action.  That argument would, \nhowever, deprive the second sentence of Section \n307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect, because \nit should almost always be the case that, in taking a \nparticular action, the agency acknowledges and ap-\nplies a consistent framework or understanding of its \nClean Air Act authority that contributes to its deci-\nsionmaking in a material respect.  More is required to \ntrigger the third sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  The \ngovernment\u2019s reading, if adopted here, would deprive \nlitigants of clarity and predictability.   \nHowever the Court resolves the specific issues \npresented here, it should strive to adopt a clear inter-\npretation of the venue provisions of Section 307(b)(1) \nthat gives effect to each of their components.   \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nMembers \nof \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nBusiness \nCommunity, Like All Litigants, Benefit from \nClear and Predictable Rules Regarding \nVenue.  \nThis Court favors, and litigants benefit from, \n\u201cclear boundaries\u201d and \u201cadministrative simplicity\u201d \nwhen it comes to the interpretation of statutes dictat-\ning where a case should be heard.

As courts and commentators \nhave long recognized, such \u201cclarity generally reduces \nlitigant costs,\u201d Scott Dodson, The Complexity of Juris-\ndictional Clarity, 97 Va. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2011), by reduc-\ning the need for \u201cadjudication that has little to do with \nthe merits,\u201d Barry Friedman, Under the Law of \n\n8 \n \nFederal Jurisdiction: Allocating Cases Between Fed-\neral and State Courts, 104 Colum. L. Rev. 1211, 1225 \n(2004). \nSimple rules \u201cpromote greater predictability,\u201d \nwhich also \u201cis valuable to corporations making busi-\nness and investment decisions,\u201d Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94, \nand \u201cfacilitate[s] efficient private bargaining in the \nshadow of the law,\u201d Jonathan Remy Nash, On the Ef-\nficient Deployment of Rules and Standards to Define \nFederal Jurisdiction, 65 Vand. L. Rev. 509, 522 (2012); \nsee also William Grayson Lambert, The Necessary \nNarrowing of General Personal Jurisdiction, 100 \nMarq. L. Rev. 375, 415 (2016) (clear and predictable \nrules \u201callow[] individuals and businesses to order their \naffairs and have rational expectations about where po-\ntential disputes could be resolved\u201d). \nOn the other hand, complex tests governing juris-\ndiction, venue, and other threshold questions \u201ccompli-\ncate a case, eating up time and money as the parties \nlitigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court \nis the right court to decide those claims.\u201d  Hertz, 559 \nU.S. at 94; see also Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. \n458, 464 n.13 (1980) (in discussing related question of \njurisdiction, emphasizing that \u201c[i]t is of first im-\nportance to have a definition * * * [that] will not invite \nextensive threshold litigation * * * over whether the \ncase is in the right court,\u201d which \u201cis essentially a waste \nof time and resources\u201d).  Complex and unclear rules \n\u201cproduce appeals and reversals, [and] encourage \ngamesmanship.\u201d  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94; see also Dod-\nson, supra, at 8 (\u201c[W]hen the court does resolve a ju-\nrisdictional issue under clear doctrine, that decision is \nlikely to be accurate, causing fewer appeals and fewer \n\n9 \n \nreversals.\u201d).  The resources spent litigating such ques-\ntions \u201ccould otherwise be used to expand business, cre-\nate jobs, and develop new products\u201d; in many contexts, \nthose costs may instead be \u201cpassed on to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices.\u201d  Lisa Litwiller, Why Amend-\nments to Rule 23 Are Not Enough: A Case for the Fed-\neralization of Class Actions, 7 Chap. L. Rev. 201, 202 \n(2004). \nIn cases such as this one involving challenges to \nfederal agency action, uncertainty over proper venue \ncan spawn unnecessary (and often fruitless) litigation \nin multiple respects.  For instance, although parties \nmay raise objections to venue in preliminary motions, \nappellate courts regularly carry venue questions with \nthe case, deferring their resolution to the merits panel.  \nSee, e.g., Order, Nev. Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDoc. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. \nEPA, No. 23-9509, Doc. No. 93 (10th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2023).  As a result, parties must devote considerable \ntime and resources to fully briefing the merits of a case \nthat may ultimately be transferred or dismissed for \nimproper venue, leading to duplication of effort and re-\nbriefing in the new forum.  E.g., Oklahoma v. EPA, 93 \nF.4th 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 2024).  And even where \nvenue is retained, the assigned court is forced to dedi-\ncate substantial energy to addressing venue issues.  \nSee Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2024 WL 5001991 \n(6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024) (devoting roughly 15 pages of \n41-page opinion to Section 307(b)(1) venue issue). \nAdditionally, to hedge against the risk that a pe-\ntition for review in one court might be dismissed on \nvenue grounds, parties often \u201cprotectively\u201d file cases in \nmultiple venues, leading to additional expenditures of \n\n10 \n \nresources by the courts and parties.  See, e.g., Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n2022) (noting that the petitioner had filed protective \npetition for review in Ninth Circuit, in case governed \nby Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act; holding that \nvenue was proper in Ninth Circuit); Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 926 F.3d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (similar).  This \nCourt encountered such a practice in National Associ-\nation of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, \nwhich addressed and resolved confusion over whether \na particular EPA decision fell within a statutorily enu-\nmerated list of actions that must be reviewed in fed-\neral courts of appeals, rather than district courts.  583 \nU.S. 109, 114 (2018).  Due to uncertainty regarding \nthis question, numerous parties had \u201cfile[d] \u2018protec-\ntive\u2019 petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals \nto preserve their challenges in the event that their Dis-\ntrict Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of juris-\ndiction.\u201d  Id. at 119.  Divergent jurisdictional decisions \nensued: one court of appeals exercised jurisdiction to \nstay EPA\u2019s rule, while a district court held that it had \njurisdiction to review the rule, and other district \ncourts dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Ibid. \nWhile parties and courts work to resolve confusion \nas to venue questions, the ultimate resolution of the \nunderlying merits is further delayed, with negative \npractical consequences for regulators, regulated enti-\nties, and other stakeholders.  For example, in the \nFourth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit litigation involv-\ning EPA\u2019s disapprovals of West Virginia\u2019s and Ala-\nbama\u2019s plans to address \u201cgood neighbor\u201d obligations \narising out of the most recent ozone air quality stand-\nards, the courts have postponed deciding the cases on \n\n11 \n \nthe merits pending this Court\u2019s resolution of the venue \nquestion.  Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11196, Doc. \nNo. 56 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2024); Order, West Virginia \nv. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. No. 126 (4th Cir. Oct. 21, \n2024).  In parallel cases in the Fifth and Eighth Cir-\ncuits, the courts likewise have not yet disposed of pe-\ntitions for review on the merits, despite having acted \non stay motions for those disapprovals more than 18 \nmonths ago.  See Order, Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-\n1320, Doc. No. 5280996 (8th Cir. May 25, 2023); Texas \nv. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 (5th Cir. May \n1, 2023). \nAll of these inefficiencies add up to very real costs \nfor litigants and the courts.  The resultant delays are \nhard to square with Congress\u2019s intention to expedite \nresolution of the challenges by allowing direct review \nin the courts of appeals.  See Virginia v. United States, \n74 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 1996) (direct appellate re-\nview creates a streamlined process for \u201cprompt and \nconclusive\u201d judicial review of agency actions); accord \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985) (direct appellate review of agency decisions \navoids \u201cduplication of the identical task in the district \ncourt and in the court of appeals\u201d).  And regulated par-\nties will incur higher transition and compliance costs, \nand all stakeholders will experience extended periods \nof uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under re-\nview. \nThese negative consequences can be mitigated, \nand clarity and predictability improved, by adopting \nan interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue rules \nthat adheres faithfully to the statutory text.  See An-\ntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \n\n12 \n \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, at xxix (2012) (interpre-\ntive approach grounded in the text will typically \u201cpro-\nvide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater \npredictability\u201d).  That precept is especially true with \nrespect to the interpretation of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhere Congress crafted a reticulated and balanced \nstatutory scheme that channels certain kinds of cases \nto the D.C. Circuit and others to the appropriate re-\ngional circuits. \nII. \nThis \nCourt \nShould \nInterpret \nSection \n307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act in a Manner \nthat \nProvides \nClear, \nPredictable, \nand \nAdministrable Principles for Determining \nVenue. \nSection 307(b)(1) provides a three-part structure \nfor determining which court of appeals must hear a pe-\ntition for review of a final action by EPA: \n\u2022 The first sentence of Section 307(b)(1) states \nthat a petition for review of any of an enumer-\nated list of EPA actions, \u201cor any other nation-\nally applicable regulations promulgated, or fi-\nnal action taken, by [EPA] under this chapter[,] \nmay be filed only in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. \n\u2022 The second sentence provides that a petition for \nreview of any of another enumerated list of EPA \nactions \u201cor any other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable may be filed \nonly in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \u201cfor the ap-\npropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u2022 The third sentence creates a limited exception \nto the second, stating that an action referenced \n\n13 \n \nin the second sentence is reviewable only in the \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It \nrepresents approximately 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than 3 mil-\nlion companies and professional organizations of every \nsize, in every industry sector, and from every region of \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto represent the interests of its members in matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nTo that end, the Chamber regularly files amicus curiae \nbriefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues of con-\ncern to the nation\u2019s business community. \nThe Chamber has an interest in maintaining effi-\ncient and predictable mechanisms for judicial review \nof federal agency action.  An important, frequently re-\ncurring, and oft-litigated threshold question in such \ncases is which court or courts are the proper venue for \nchallenges.  All stakeholders\u2014even those whose un-\nderlying interests in the merits of a dispute may be \ndiametrically opposed\u2014have a shared interest in hav-\ning clear and readily administrable rules governing \nthe selection of venue.  Unpredictable and unclear \nvenue rules can lead to wasteful and time-consuming \nthreshold litigation about whether venue is proper, in-\ncreasing the overall cost and uncertainty, and delay-\ning the ultimate resolution, of challenges to agency ac-\ntion. \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, or its counsel, made any monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nThe venue provisions in Section 307(b)(1) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), are significant \nin their own right, as they specify venue for judicial \nreview of a broad range of actions taken by the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air \nAct\u2014actions that, individually and in aggregate, can \nhave significant practical and economic consequences \nfor members of the nation\u2019s business community.  Un-\ncertainty and confusion about the meaning of these \nimportant provisions can have significant negative ef-\nfects\u2014as vividly illustrated by the circumstances and \nlengthy procedural history of the cases under review \nand other related litigation. \nThe Chamber files this brief as amicus curiae in \nsupport of neither party, taking no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases.  Instead, the \nChamber urges the Court to adopt an interpretation \nthat provides clarity and predictability to all stake-\nholders, and minimizes or avoids unnecessary and \nwasteful threshold litigation over the appropriate \nvenue for challenges brought under the Clean Air Act.  \nIn the Chamber\u2019s view, those interests would be best \nserved by an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that is \nfaithful to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory con-\nstruction. \nBy contrast, interests in clarity and predictability \nwould be disserved by a reading that allows the gov-\nernment to unilaterally select (or even manipulate) \nthe proper venue through its choice of formalities, \nsuch as whether to \u201cbundle\u201d together several individ-\nual actions into a single omnibus notice for purposes \nof publication in the Federal Register.  Similarly, \n\n3 \n \ninterests in clarity and predictability would be dis-\nserved by an interpretation that fails to give meaning \nand independent significance to each of the separate \nprovisions in Section 307(b)(1), which provide guid-\nance to litigants by drawing a line between cases that \ncan be brought only in the D.C. Circuit and cases for \nwhich venue lies exclusively in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  The Court should not endorse a reading \nthat would deprive any portion of Section 307(b)(1), in-\ncluding the second sentence addressing cases to be \nbought in the regional circuits, of meaningful inde-\npendent effect.  Such a reading would not comport \nwith the statutory text and would have adverse conse-\nquences for members of the nation\u2019s business commu-\nnity and for other litigants. \n INTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The nation\u2019s businesses, no less than other liti-\ngants, benefit from clarity and predictability in rules \nregarding where and when lawsuits can be brought, \nincluding rules regarding the selection of venue in \nchallenges to federal agency action.  Litigants avoid \nspending time and money litigating threshold issues \nwhen it is clear up front which court should adjudicate \na particular dispute.  Clarity in the articulation of \nvenue principles, in turn, promotes predictability in \ntheir application, enabling private parties to make in-\nformed business and investment decisions and other-\nwise order their affairs.  In short, certainty, transpar-\nency, and predictability regarding where certain types \nof claims will be litigated yield real-world benefits to \nlitigants and other stakeholders. \n\n4 \n \nBy contrast, complexity and uncertainty in the \nrules governing where a case may be brought consume \nvaluable resources as parties litigate the choice of the \nappropriate forum.  In the context of litigation chal-\nlenging federal agency actions, uncertainty regarding \nvenue rules can generate still further inefficiencies, \nsuch as the filing and consideration of protective peti-\ntions in multiple courts, when the law is unclear as to \nwhich court is appropriate, and the preparation and \nconsideration of merits briefs in cases that are ulti-\nmately dismissed for improper venue.  Meanwhile, \nresolution of merits issues is delayed, undermining \nCongress\u2019s decision to expedite challenges to certain \nfederal agency actions by (as here) authorizing direct \nappellate review.  Delay in resolving challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions in administering the Clean Air Act can \nharm all stakeholders, increasing transition and com-\npliance costs for regulated parties, and extending pe-\nriods of uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under \nreview. \nII. \nSection 307(b)(1) specifies that EPA\u2019s nation-\nally applicable actions will be reviewed in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit, while regionally or locally applicable actions will \nbe reviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, unless \nsuch an action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.  Although the Chamber takes no \nposition on the Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, and does not attempt to provide a universal tax-\nonomy of the cases that belong in the D.C. Circuit ver-\nsus regional circuits, this brief offers several interpre-\ntative points that would advance interests of clarity \nand predictability. \n\n5 \n \nFirst, a key textual distinction in Section 307(b)(1) \nis whether a given EPA action is \u201cnationally\u201d versus \n\u201clocally \nor \nregionally\u201d \napplicable. \n 42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  While hard cases for drawing that line \nmay exist, the inquiry should remain focused on the \nsubstance of the actions being taken by EPA, with \nclose attention to the statutory authority pursuant to \nwhich EPA has acted.  That approach follows from the \nstatutory text, which defines venue for different cate-\ngories of cases by cross-referencing substantive provi-\nsions of the Clean Air Act.  Where the substance of an \nEPA action is specific to a particular region or locality, \nthat action should be reviewed in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  Conversely, when the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action is nationally applicable, the case belongs \nin the D.C. Circuit. \nSecond, and relatedly, venue determinations \nshould not turn on formalistic or procedural distinc-\ntions that are disconnected from the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action.  Such an interpretation would open the \ndoor to manipulation, undermining interests in pre-\ndictability and certainty.  It would be improper, there-\nfore, to treat the analysis of venue under Section \n307(b)(1) as affected or even determined by whether \nEPA decides to bundle multiple individual actions into \na single notice for publication in the Federal Register, \nif in fact each individual action pertains to a specific \nlocation.  Allowing such bundling to affect the venue \nanalysis would increase uncertainty and inefficiency \nfor actions that, in substance, are fundamentally local \nor regional in nature.  And it would disserve interests \nin predictability, because regulated parties would \nhave no way of knowing in advance whether EPA \n\n6 \n \nwould combine multiple individual actions (each re-\ngional or local in character) into a single publication \npackage.   \nThird, meaningful effect should be given to each \nseparate part of the venue provisions in Section \n307(b)(1).  Congress took care to identify and distin-\nguish between classes of cases that are always subject \nto review in the D.C. Circuit (first sentence), and clas-\nses of cases that are presumptively subject to review \nin the regional circuits (second sentence).  And Con-\ngress provided a narrow exception to the second sen-\ntence for regional actions that are \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d (third sen-\ntence).  The third sentence should be interpreted in \nlight of that structure and not as a means for overrid-\ning the division in the previous two sentences. \nIII. Applying these principles to the issues before \nthe Court in these cases, a natural starting point is to \nrecognize that the EPA disapprovals of state imple-\nmentation plans challenged in these cases lie in the \nheartland of Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s list of orders reviewa-\nble in the regional circuit courts.  EPA has argued that \nit can effectively channel any case to the D.C. Circuit \nby packaging together multiple individual actions; \nthat argument, however, runs afoul of each of the prin-\nciples discussed above, that interpretation of the \nvenue provisions should focus on the statutory text \nand the substance of EPA\u2019s actions and should give \nmeaningful effect to each sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  \nEPA has also argued that an action is reviewable in \nthe D.C. Circuit under the third sentence of Section \n307(b)(1), so long as EPA identifies some underlying \n\u201clegal and technical determinations\u201d that apply across \n\n7 \n \nstates and that constitute even one among many of the \nbut-for causes of its action.  That argument would, \nhowever, deprive the second sentence of Section \n307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect, because \nit should almost always be the case that, in taking a \nparticular action, the agency acknowledges and ap-\nplies a consistent framework or understanding of its \nClean Air Act authority that contributes to its deci-\nsionmaking in a material respect.  More is required to \ntrigger the third sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  The \ngovernment\u2019s reading, if adopted here, would deprive \nlitigants of clarity and predictability.   \nHowever the Court resolves the specific issues \npresented here, it should strive to adopt a clear inter-\npretation of the venue provisions of Section 307(b)(1) \nthat gives effect to each of their components.   \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nMembers \nof \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nBusiness \nCommunity, Like All Litigants, Benefit from \nClear and Predictable Rules Regarding \nVenue.  \nThis Court favors, and litigants benefit from, \n\u201cclear boundaries\u201d and \u201cadministrative simplicity\u201d \nwhen it comes to the interpretation of statutes dictat-\ning where a case should be heard.  Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n \nv. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 11 (2015); Hertz Corp. v. Friend, \n559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010).  As courts and commentators \nhave long recognized, such \u201cclarity generally reduces \nlitigant costs,\u201d Scott Dodson, The Complexity of Juris-\ndictional Clarity, 97 Va. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2011), by reduc-\ning the need for \u201cadjudication that has little to do with \nthe merits,\u201d Barry Friedman, Under the Law of \n\n8 \n \nFederal Jurisdiction: Allocating Cases Between Fed-\neral and State Courts, 104 Colum. L. Rev. 1211, 1225 \n(2004). \nSimple rules \u201cpromote greater predictability,\u201d \nwhich also \u201cis valuable to corporations making busi-\nness and investment decisions,\u201d Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94, \nand \u201cfacilitate[s] efficient private bargaining in the \nshadow of the law,\u201d Jonathan Remy Nash, On the Ef-\nficient Deployment of Rules and Standards to Define \nFederal Jurisdiction, 65 Vand. L. Rev. 509, 522 (2012); \nsee also William Grayson Lambert, The Necessary \nNarrowing of General Personal Jurisdiction, 100 \nMarq. L. Rev. 375, 415 (2016) (clear and predictable \nrules \u201callow[] individuals and businesses to order their \naffairs and have rational expectations about where po-\ntential disputes could be resolved\u201d). \nOn the other hand, complex tests governing juris-\ndiction, venue, and other threshold questions \u201ccompli-\ncate a case, eating up time and money as the parties \nlitigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court \nis the right court to decide those claims.\u201d  Hertz, 559 \nU.S. at 94; see also Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. \n458, 464 n.13 (1980) (in discussing related question of \njurisdiction, emphasizing that \u201c[i]t is of first im-\nportance to have a definition * * * [that] will not invite \nextensive threshold litigation * * * over whether the \ncase is in the right court,\u201d which \u201cis essentially a waste \nof time and resources\u201d).  Complex and unclear rules \n\u201cproduce appeals and reversals, [and] encourage \ngamesmanship.\u201d  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94; see also Dod-\nson, supra, at 8 (\u201c[W]hen the court does resolve a ju-\nrisdictional issue under clear doctrine, that decision is \nlikely to be accurate, causing fewer appeals and fewer \n\n9 \n \nreversals.\u201d).  The resources spent litigating such ques-\ntions \u201ccould otherwise be used to expand business, cre-\nate jobs, and develop new products\u201d; in many contexts, \nthose costs may instead be \u201cpassed on to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices.\u201d  Lisa Litwiller, Why Amend-\nments to Rule 23 Are Not Enough: A Case for the Fed-\neralization of Class Actions, 7 Chap. L. Rev. 201, 202 \n(2004). \nIn cases such as this one involving challenges to \nfederal agency action, uncertainty over proper venue \ncan spawn unnecessary (and often fruitless) litigation \nin multiple respects.  For instance, although parties \nmay raise objections to venue in preliminary motions, \nappellate courts regularly carry venue questions with \nthe case, deferring their resolution to the merits panel.  \nSee, e.g., Order, Nev. Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDoc. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. \nEPA, No. 23-9509, Doc. No. 93 (10th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2023).  As a result, parties must devote considerable \ntime and resources to fully briefing the merits of a case \nthat may ultimately be transferred or dismissed for \nimproper venue, leading to duplication of effort and re-\nbriefing in the new forum.  E.g., Oklahoma v. EPA, 93 \nF.4th 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 2024).  And even where \nvenue is retained, the assigned court is forced to dedi-\ncate substantial energy to addressing venue issues.  \nSee Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2024 WL 5001991 \n(6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024) (devoting roughly 15 pages of \n41-page opinion to Section 307(b)(1) venue issue). \nAdditionally, to hedge against the risk that a pe-\ntition for review in one court might be dismissed on \nvenue grounds, parties often \u201cprotectively\u201d file cases in \nmultiple venues, leading to additional expenditures of \n\n10 \n \nresources by the courts and parties.  See, e.g., Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n2022) (noting that the petitioner had filed protective \npetition for review in Ninth Circuit, in case governed \nby Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act; holding that \nvenue was proper in Ninth Circuit); Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 926 F.3d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (similar).  This \nCourt encountered such a practice in National Associ-\nation of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, \nwhich addressed and resolved confusion over whether \na particular EPA decision fell within a statutorily enu-\nmerated list of actions that must be reviewed in fed-\neral courts of appeals, rather than district courts.  583 \nU.S. 109, 114 (2018).  Due to uncertainty regarding \nthis question, numerous parties had \u201cfile[d] \u2018protec-\ntive\u2019 petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals \nto preserve their challenges in the event that their Dis-\ntrict Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of juris-\ndiction.\u201d  Id. at 119.  Divergent jurisdictional decisions \nensued: one court of appeals exercised jurisdiction to \nstay EPA\u2019s rule, while a district court held that it had \njurisdiction to review the rule, and other district \ncourts dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Ibid. \nWhile parties and courts work to resolve confusion \nas to venue questions, the ultimate resolution of the \nunderlying merits is further delayed, with negative \npractical consequences for regulators, regulated enti-\nties, and other stakeholders.  For example, in the \nFourth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit litigation involv-\ning EPA\u2019s disapprovals of West Virginia\u2019s and Ala-\nbama\u2019s plans to address \u201cgood neighbor\u201d obligations \narising out of the most recent ozone air quality stand-\nards, the courts have postponed deciding the cases on \n\n11 \n \nthe merits pending this Court\u2019s resolution of the venue \nquestion.  Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11196, Doc. \nNo. 56 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2024); Order, West Virginia \nv. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. No. 126 (4th Cir. Oct. 21, \n2024).  In parallel cases in the Fifth and Eighth Cir-\ncuits, the courts likewise have not yet disposed of pe-\ntitions for review on the merits, despite having acted \non stay motions for those disapprovals more than 18 \nmonths ago.  See Order, Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-\n1320, Doc. No. 5280996 (8th Cir. May 25, 2023); Texas \nv. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 (5th Cir. May \n1, 2023). \nAll of these inefficiencies add up to very real costs \nfor litigants and the courts.  The resultant delays are \nhard to square with Congress\u2019s intention to expedite \nresolution of the challenges by allowing direct review \nin the courts of appeals.  See Virginia v. United States, \n74 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 1996) (direct appellate re-\nview creates a streamlined process for \u201cprompt and \nconclusive\u201d judicial review of agency actions); accord \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985) (direct appellate review of agency decisions \navoids \u201cduplication of the identical task in the district \ncourt and in the court of appeals\u201d).  And regulated par-\nties will incur higher transition and compliance costs, \nand all stakeholders will experience extended periods \nof uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under re-\nview. \nThese negative consequences can be mitigated, \nand clarity and predictability improved, by adopting \nan interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue rules \nthat adheres faithfully to the statutory text.  See An-\ntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \n\n12 \n \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, at xxix (2012) (interpre-\ntive approach grounded in the text will typically \u201cpro-\nvide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater \npredictability\u201d).  That precept is especially true with \nrespect to the interpretation of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhere Congress crafted a reticulated and balanced \nstatutory scheme that channels certain kinds of cases \nto the D.C. Circuit and others to the appropriate re-\ngional circuits. \nII. \nThis \nCourt \nShould \nInterpret \nSection \n307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act in a Manner \nthat \nProvides \nClear, \nPredictable, \nand \nAdministrable Principles for Determining \nVenue. \nSection 307(b)(1) provides a three-part structure \nfor determining which court of appeals must hear a pe-\ntition for review of a final action by EPA: \n\u2022 The first sentence of Section 307(b)(1) states \nthat a petition for review of any of an enumer-\nated list of EPA actions, \u201cor any other nation-\nally applicable regulations promulgated, or fi-\nnal action taken, by [EPA] under this chapter[,] \nmay be filed only in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. \n\u2022 The second sentence provides that a petition for \nreview of any of another enumerated list of EPA \nactions \u201cor any other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable may be filed \nonly in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \u201cfor the ap-\npropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u2022 The third sentence creates a limited exception \nto the second, stating that an action referenced \n\n13 \n \nin the second sentence is reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit \u201cif such action is based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect \nand if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added).   \nThree principles from this text provide a helpful \nguide for understanding its application in cases like \nthese.   \n1.  First, decisions about whether a particular \nEPA action is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable,\u201d or \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d should be grounded in the \nsubstance of the relevant actions EPA is taking.  This \ninterpretation aligns with, and follows from, the de-\ntailed statutory enumerations of actions reviewable in \nparticular circuits that Congress included here.   \nThe references to specific categories of agency ac-\ntions in Section 307(b)(1) focus on the substantive na-\nture of, and legal authority underlying, those actions, \nas indicated by the extensive statutory cross-refer-\nences to other substantive provisions of the Clean Air \nAct authorizing EPA to act.  For example, the actions \nthat are to be reviewed exclusively by the D.C. Circuit \ninclude those that promulgate \u201cany national * * * am-\nbient air quality standard [NAAQS],\u201d \u201cany emission \nstandard\u201d for hazardous air pollutants under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412, and \u201cany standard of performance\u201d for \nstationary sources of pollutants under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7411.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  Actions presump-\ntively reviewable in the appropriate regional circuit, \n\n14 \n \nby contrast, include \u201capproving or promulgating any \n[state] implementation plan\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410, \nany order granting a waiver of performance require-\nments for a specific emissions source (\u201cwith the con-\nsent of the Governor of the State in which the source \nis to be located\u201d) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(j), and any \norder imposing a noncompliance penalty for a specific \nemissions source under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7420.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Court can thus infer that, where the statute \nsubsequently refers to \u201cany other nationally applicable \n* * * final action,\u201d \u201cany other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \u201ca determination \nof nationwide scope or effect,\u201d Congress was likewise \nconcerned with whether the substance of the agency\u2019s \naction has national, local, or regional applicability, or \nwhether the substance of the underlying determina-\ntion has nationwide scope or effect.  See Bissonnette v. \nLePage Bakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 \n(2024) (Under the ejusdem generis canon, \u201ccourts in-\nterpret a general or collective term at the end of a list \nof specific items in light of any common attribute[s] \nshared by the specific items.\u201d) (quotation marks omit-\nted).  Under this textual and interpretative approach, \nthe appropriate regional circuit should review an EPA \naction that makes determinations specific to a partic-\nular locality or region. \n2.  Second, and relatedly, venue selection should \nnot turn on purely formalistic distinctions or factors \nthat are otherwise disconnected from the substance of \nthe agency action in question, such as EPA\u2019s decision \n(or not) to \u201cbundle\u201d individual actions together for pur-\nposes of publication in the Federal Register.  The \n\n15 \n \nenumeration of EPA actions in Section 307(b)(1), as \ndiscussed above, looks to the underlying substantive \nauthority being exercised, not the form in which the \nagency chooses to publish one or more of its actions.  \nIndeed, if Congress had wanted to peg reviewability to \nthe form in which EPA published its actions, it could \neasily have done so.  Instead, Congress gave EPA care-\nfully limited discretion, via the third sentence of Sec-\ntion 307(b)(1), to choose whether to publish a finding \nthat its local or regional action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect.  This Court should \nnot adopt an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that \nwould vest EPA with the much broader discretion to \nchannel virtually any case to the D.C. Circuit by re-\ndefining the nature of the action via an atextual \u201cbun-\ndling\u201d theory. \nBy tying review to the substance of EPA\u2019s action, \nCongress also avoided opening the venue question to \nthe sort of manipulation that this Court has sought to \ndiscourage.  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94.  And it promoted \npredictability and certainty for regulated parties, who \ncommonly undertake a great deal of decisionmaking \nand preparatory work in advance of an EPA order\u2014\nwhether in seeking authorizations, investing in future \ncompliance, or in making other strategic business \njudgments\u2014some of which may be affected by the ex-\npected venue in which a petition for review of the \nagency\u2019s action may be heard.  See Hertz, 559 U.S. at \n94; Nash, supra, at 522; Lambert, supra, at 415.  If the \nform in which EPA chooses to publish an agency action \nprevails over the substance of the action in determin-\ning venue, the resulting uncertainty would hamper \n\n16 \n \nregulated parties\u2019 ability to engage in informed deci-\nsionmaking. \nIndeed, if discretionary, formalistic characteris-\ntics like the \u201cbundling\u201d of actions for publication were \ndispositive under Section 307(b)(1), confusion as to the \nproper venue could linger even after EPA issues a no-\ntice combining various regionally applicable actions.  \nAssuming for the sake of argument that an EPA action \nbecomes \u201cnational\u201d in character merely because it has \nbeen published together with numerous other actions \nthat, collectively, cover different areas of the country, \n\u201c[w]ould this logic reach an action that covered only \nCalifornia, Maine, and Alabama because they fall in \ndifferent parts of the country?  If not, how many more \nStates are needed?\u201d  Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at \n*8.   \nChanneling cases to the D.C. Circuit for reasons \nof form rather than substance would pose particular \nproblems whenever the agency concurrently issues a \nlarge number of actions that are each locally focused \nand fact-intensive.  The administrative record for any \nindividual agency action can consist of many hundreds \nor thousands of pages.  But where EPA\u2019s decision in \nreality consists of a series of distinct actions, each rest-\ning on individualized, fact-bound analysis focused on a \nparticular state or region, the aggregation of all those \nactions into a single review proceeding before a single \ncourt could easily result in an excessively large record \nand a need for briefs covering a panoply of complex is-\nsues specific to each of EPA\u2019s actions.  Forcing such \ncases to the D.C. Circuit could place significant strain \non judicial resources, as well as deprive the parties of \na full opportunity to argue the complex, locality-\n\n17 \n \nspecific issues that would be more fully vetted in a pro-\nceeding in a regional circuit devoted to those issues \nalone\u2014as Congress intended.  \n3.  Third, meaningful effect must be given  to each \nof the separate provisions in Section 307(b)(1)\u2014in-\ncluding the first, second, and third sentences.  After \nall, it is a \u201ccardinal principle of interpretation that \ncourts must give effect, if possible, to every clause and \nword of a statute.\u201d  Liu v. SEC, 591 U.S. 71, 89 (2020).  \nIn applying ordinary principles of statutory construc-\ntion, this Court has long avoided interpretations that \nwould treat any aspect of Congress\u2019s scheme as \u201cmean-\ningless\u201d or having \u201cno consequence.\u201d  Ibid.; Nielsen v. \nPreap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 (2019). \nHere, Congress divided responsibility for review of \nEPA\u2019s decisions under this scheme between the D.C. \nCircuit and the regional circuits.  This Court should \nadopt a reading that respects the balance that Con-\ngress struck, and does not deprive one provision of the \nstatute of meaningful effect (e.g., the part enumerat-\ning cases to be heard \u201conly\u201d in the regional circuits) \nthrough an overbroad interpretation of another provi-\nsion (e.g., the part ensuring that certain actions based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect are \nreviewed \u201conly\u201d in the D.C. Circuit).  The balance \nstruck by Congress accounts for a variety of consider-\nations.  For example, Congress presumably knew that \nregional circuit courts are most likely to be familiar \nwith and well-informed regarding legal and factual is-\nsues that affect local and regional interests.  These can \ninclude principles of state law that often arise in coop-\nerative federalism regimes such as the Clean Air Act, \nand the mix of legal, economic, social, and other \n\n18 \n \npractical considerations affecting major regulatory ac-\ntions.  See State Br. 54-55; cf. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d \n405, 424 (5th Cir. 2016) (asserting venue over chal-\nlenges to EPA\u2019s disapproval of Texas\u2019s and Oklahoma\u2019s \nplans for implementing air visibility standards); Texas \nv. EPA, 706 F. App\u2019x 159 (5th Cir. 2017) (same, for \nEPA\u2019s designation of three areas in Texas as not at-\ntaining revised air quality standards for sulfur diox-\nide).  And channeling regionally focused EPA actions \nto the regional circuits avoids disconnecting litigation \nfrom the areas where the effects of the agency\u2019s action \nare most acutely and directly felt.  So too does siting \ncases in the regional circuits avoid burdening litigants \nwith the higher travel and logistical costs associated \nwith litigating challenges in D.C.  And it avoids poten-\ntial optical concerns that an agency may enjoy a \n\u201chometown advantage\u201d in defending its decisions in \nWashington, D.C. \nBy contrast, siting review of truly nationally ap-\nplicable regulations, and certain determinations of na-\ntionwide scope or effect, in the D.C. Circuit avoids the \nprospect of conflicting decisions from multiple circuits \nover the same agency actions.  Multiple petitions filed \nin the D.C. Circuit can simply be consolidated, allow-\ning for more efficient review for all\u2014the government, \nprivate litigants, and the courts. \nIn sum, Congress contemplated that both the D.C. \nCircuit and regional circuits would have a meaningful \nrole.  This is not a statute, like some, that centralizes \n\n19 \n \nall review in the D.C. Circuit,2 or that vests regional \ncircuits with exclusive and irrebuttable jurisdiction \nover an entire category of cases.3  None of the sen-\ntences in Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s venue provisions should \nbe interpreted to undermine Congress\u2019s choices in as-\nsigning venue for judicial review of different kinds of \nEPA actions. \nIII. As Applied in These Cases, These Principles \nSupport Adopting an Interpretation that \nGives Real and Substantial Effect to Each \nPart of Section 307(b)(1). \nAlthough the Chamber takes no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases, the princi-\nples articulated above should provide helpful guidance \nin resolving the specific venue questions presented \nhere.  These cases concern EPA\u2019s disapproval of Utah\u2019s \nand Oklahoma\u2019s state plans for implementing EPA\u2019s \nozone standards under the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cGood \nNeighbor Provision.\u201d  State Pet. 1; see 88 Fed. Reg. \n9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  The cases thus involve EPA ac-\ntions that lie in the heartland of the list of actions enu-\nmerated in the second sentence of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhich include those actions that \u201capprov[e] or promul-\ngat[e] any implementation plan\u201d for EPA\u2019s air quality \nstandards, as well as any locally or regionally applica-\nble \u201cdenial or disapproval\u201d of such a plan.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1);  accord Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023) \n \n2 Cf., e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(a)(1) (Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(a) (Comprehensive Environmen-\ntal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). \n3 Cf. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1) (Natural Gas Act). \n\n20 \n \n(\u201cJust as most * * * approvals of SIPs * * * unequivo-\ncally fall in the \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 cate-\ngory, so too does the disapproval of SIPs.\u201d) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); see also Chevron, 45 \nF.4th at 386 (\u201cApproving or promulgating a State Im-\nplementation Plan is the prototypical \u2018locally or re-\ngionally applicable\u2019 action that may be challenged only \nin the appropriate regional court of appeals.\u201d) (cleaned \nup).  The statute thus appears to create a presumption \nthat actions of the kind at issue here should be re-\nviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, rather than \nthe D.C. Circuit. \nIn resisting that conclusion, the government has \nargued that its disapprovals were \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d implicating the first sentence of Section 307(b)(1), \nbecause EPA published one document combining the \ndisapprovals of various state implementation plans, \nand because each disapproval was based on a common \n\u201cprocess and standard.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. Br. 10; see \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9380 (arguing that combined SIP dis-\napprovals amounted to a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action \nunder Section 307(b)(1) because \u201cEPA is applying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods * * * in a large number of states lo-\ncated across the country\u201d; also citing \u201cthe interdepend-\nent nature of interstate pollution transport and the \ncommon core of knowledge and analysis involved in \nevaluating the submitted SIPs\u201d).  Alternatively, EPA \nargues that its disapprovals were based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope and effect, implicating the \nexception in the third sentence, because EPA relied on \n\u201clegal and technical determinations that applied \nacross the various States.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. Br. 10; \n\n21 \n \nsee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9380-9381.  But as discussed above, \nEPA\u2019s bundling argument is difficult to reconcile with \nan interpretative approach that focuses on the sub-\nstance and underlying statutory authority of each of \nEPA\u2019s actions, rather than distinctions based on ad-\nministrative convenience or form. \n \nEPA\u2019s interpretation risks depriving the second \nsentence of any real and meaningful effect, thereby \nundermining interests of clarity and predictability.  \nSee Brohl, 575 U.S. at 11; Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94.  There \nis no apparent constraint on EPA\u2019s ability to bundle \nmultiple locally focused decisions into a single rule or \norder for purposes of publication, as it did here.  See \nState Br. 30.  So if the \u201cbundling\u201d of individual local or \nor regional actions transformed those discrete actions \ninto a single, national action, the agency would effec-\ntively \u201chave the choice\u201d of which tribunal would hear \na case, and it could ensure that virtually none of its \nactions were reviewed outside the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTravis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961).   \nSimilar concerns are implicated by an interpreta-\ntion that would justify venue in the D.C. Circuit any \ntime the agency has taken action to deny a state im-\nplementation plan while utilizing \u201ca uniform process \nand standard\u201d or common \u201clegal and technical deter-\nminations.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. 10.  It is difficult to dis-\ncern a meaningful limiting principle in that position, \na problem exacerbated by the government\u2019s expan-\nsively worded assertions of discretion in this area.  See \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9380-9381 (asserting that \u201c[f]or locally \nor regionally applicable final actions, the [Clean Air \nAct] reserves to the EPA complete discretion whether \nto invoke\u201d third sentence of the venue provisions) \n\n22 \n \n(emphasis added); id. at 9380-81 (twice stating that \n\u201cthe Administrator is exercising [his] complete discre-\ntion\u201d) (emphasis added); id. at 9380 n.337 (\u201cIn deciding \nwhether to invoke the exception * * *, the Administra-\ntor takes into account a number of policy considera-\ntions, including his judgment balancing the benefit of \nobtaining the D.C. Circuit\u2019s authoritative centralized \nreview versus allowing development of the issue in \nother contexts and the best use of agency resources.\u201d).   \nIn virtually every action under the Clean Air Act, \nthe agency will, to some non-trivial extent, rely on and \napply a consistent, generally applicable understand-\ning of the statutes and rules governing its administra-\ntion of the Clean Air Act.  See West Virginia v. EPA, \n90 F.4th 323, 329-330 (4th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[I]f application \nof a national standard  * * * were the controlling fac-\ntor, there never could be a local or regional action as \nrecognized by the Clean Air Act because every action \nof the EPA purportedly applies a national standard.\u201d); \nChevron, 45 F.4th at 387 (\u201c[M]any locally or regionally \napplicable actions may require interpretation of the \nClean Air Act\u2019s statutory terms, and that kind of in-\nterpretive exercise alone does not transform a locally \napplicable action into a nationally applicable one.  * * *  \n[T]hat a challenged action \u2018applies a broad regulation \nto a specific context\u2019 and \u2018may set a precedent for fu-\nture * * * proceedings\u2019 does not make it nationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d).  The Court should not adopt an interpreta-\ntion of Section 307(b)(1) that would, as a practical mat-\nter, give EPA sweeping discretion to decide venue and \nrender the second sentence\u2019s regional-review provision \na dead letter in most, if not all, cases, subverting \n\n23 \n \nCongress\u2019s intent as reflected in the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted. \n CONCLUSION \nWhatever this Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, it should adopt a clear interpretation of Section \n307(b)(1), grounded firmly in the statutory text, that \npromotes predictability and certainty in the selection \nof venue. \n\n24 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal arguments has now reached a mature stage, encompassing the full cycle of briefing from the petitioners' initial arguments, the respondent's defense, and now the petitioners' rebuttal. The \"Reply Brief for Petitioners\" directly counters the EPA's justifications for D.C. Circuit jurisdiction, sharpening the central conflict and exposing the key pressure points the Supreme Court will have to resolve.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, but Refined):** My belief that the petitioners' case rests on a textual and structural interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is reinforced. They argue that the disapproval of a single State Implementation Plan (SIP) is the \"prototypical 'locally or regionally applicable' action.\" The reply brief adds a crucial textual distinction: the statute itself differentiates between the \"action\" being challenged and the \"notice of such...action...in the Federal Register,\" directly undermining the EPA's argument that the form of publication (a single notice) can define the nature of the underlying action (multiple, individual disapprovals).\n\n2.  **Respondent's First Counterargument (Stable):** My understanding of the EPA's primary argument\u2014that the disapproval rule is \"nationally applicable\" because it was a single final rule applying a uniform methodology to 21 states\u2014remains unchanged.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Second Counterargument (Stable):** My understanding of the EPA's alternative argument\u2014that the action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit because it is \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\" (e.g., the four-step framework, nationwide modeling)\u2014also remains unchanged.\n\n4.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable, but Sharpened):** The conflict remains centered on the interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Is the \"action\" the individual, state-specific disapproval (favoring petitioners) or the consolidated, multi-state rulemaking (favoring the EPA)? The reply brief sharpens this by framing the EPA's position as a form-over-substance argument that would grant the agency unchecked power to manipulate venue and engage in \"gamesmanship.\"\n\n5.  **Petitioners' Rebuttal to EPA's Arguments (New Belief):** I now have a clear understanding of the petitioners' direct refutation of the EPA's two main points:\n    *   **Rebuttal to \"Nationally Applicable\":** The petitioners argue that the EPA's reliance on \"uniform...analytical methods\" is insufficient. They contend that *every* EPA action applies a national standard from the Clean Air Act. If using a consistent method made an action \"national,\" the \"locally or regionally applicable\" category would be rendered meaningless. Crucially, they point out that the EPA used the *same* \"4-step framework\" to *approve* other state plans in separate, local notices, which suggests the framework itself does not make an action inherently national.\n    *   **Rebuttal to \"Nationwide Determination\":** The petitioners argue that the court must independently assess whether the action was truly \"based on\" a nationwide determination. They assert the \"core determinations\" were not the nationwide framework but the state-specific flaws found in each plan. They provide concrete examples: Oklahoma's disapproval was based on its failure to analyze in-state sources, and Utah's was based on its insufficient evaluation of control opportunities and other \"technical and legal flaws.\" Since these core reasons were local, the savings clause does not apply. They also dismiss the argument that the cross-border nature of pollution makes the action nationwide in effect, noting that \"air currents do not respect state boundaries,\" and accepting this logic would \"swallow the rest of the provision,\" routing almost all Clean Air Act cases to the D.C. Circuit.\n\nMy belief state has evolved from a balanced summary of two opposing views to a more dynamic understanding of the argument and counter-argument. The petitioners' reply brief provides the critical counter-narrative, arguing that the EPA's interpretation would effectively nullify the statutory default of regional circuit review for SIPs, a structure designed to reflect the Act's principle of cooperative federalism. The key question for the Court is now even clearer: does the EPA's administrative choice to bundle local actions and apply a common framework override the statute's specific direction that disapprovals of state plans are local matters for regional courts?",

The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther judicial economy, and eliminate the risk of in-\nconsistent results for different states.\u201d  Ibid.; see J.A. \n181a-186a.  \n2. Various States and industry groups challenged \nEPA\u2019s disapproval action with respect to 12 state plans.  \nThose challenges were filed in the D.C. Circuit and in \nseven regional circuits.1  Petitioners Oklahoma and \n \n1 See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418 (4th Cir. Apr. 14, \n2023); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069 (5th Cir. Feb. 14, 2023); Ken-\ntucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216 (6th Cir. Mar. 13, 2023); Arkansas v. \nEPA, No. 23-1320 (8th Cir. Feb. 16, 2023); Missouri v. EPA, No. 23-\n \n\n10 \n \nUtah (State petitioners), as well as eight industry par-\nticipants (Industry petitioners) within those States, \nfiled petitions for review in both the Tenth and D.C. Cir-\ncuits.2  In the Tenth Circuit, EPA moved to transfer \nvenue to the D.C. Circuit or to dismiss for improper \nvenue.  Pet. App. 8a.3  A motions panel stayed the dis-\napproval action as to the state plans submitted by Okla-\nhoma and Utah, and it referred the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer venue to the merits panel.  Id. at 10a-11a. \nA unanimous Tenth Circuit merits panel granted \nEPA\u2019s motion and transferred the petitions to the D.C. \nCircuit.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.  The court explained that, un-\nder the \u201cplain text\u201d of Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cwhether a pe-\ntition for review belongs in the D.C. Circuit turns exclu-\nsively on the nature of the challenged agency action,\u201d \nnot on \u201cthe scope of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.\u201d  Id. at \n12a.   \nThe court of appeals concluded that, \u201c[o]n its face,\u201d \nthe disapproval action is nationally applicable.  Pet. \nApp. 12a.  The court emphasized that the action disap-\nproves state plans \u201cfrom 21 states across the country\u2014\n \n1719 (8th Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); ALLETE, Inc. v. EPA, No. 23-1776 \n(8th Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Nevada Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682 (9th \nCir. Apr. 14, 2023); Utah v. EPA, No. 23-9509 (10th Cir. Feb. 13, \n2023); Oklahoma v. EPA, No. 23-9514 (10th Cir. Mar. 2, 2023); Ala-\nbama v. EPA, No. 23-11173 (11th Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Nevada v. \nEPA, No. 23-1113 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023).   \n2 See Utah v. EPA, No. 23-1102 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, No. 23-1103 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Oklahoma Gas \n& Elec. Co. v. EPA, No. 23-1105 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Tulsa Ce-\nment LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1106 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Western \nFarmers Elec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-1107 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); \nPacifiCorp v. EPA, No. 23-1112 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023).   \n3 Unless otherwise noted, all references in this brief to the \u201cPet. \nApp.\u201d are to the State petitioners\u2019 petition appendix in No. 23-1067.   \n\n11 \n \nspanning eight EPA regions and ten federal judicial  \ncircuits\u2014because those states all failed to comply with \nthe good-neighbor provision.\u201d  Ibid.  The court further \nexplained that, in the disapproval action, EPA had \u201cap-\nplied a uniform statutory interpretation and common \nanalytical methods\u201d to examine the \u201coverlapping and in-\nterwoven linkages between upwind and downwind \nstates in a consistent manner.\u201d  Id. at 12a-13a.   \nPetitioners argued that EPA\u2019s disapproval action \nshould be treated for venue purposes as multiple indi-\nvidual actions, each applying to a single State.  The \ncourt of appeals rejected that contention, noting that \nthe text of Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cdirects courts to consider \nonly the face of the \u2018final action.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 13a.  The \ncourt therefore viewed it as irrelevant that EPA \u201ccould \nhave chosen to issue standalone\u201d disapprovals for each \nof the 21 States.  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals recognized that motions panels \nof the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits had recently de-\nnied EPA\u2019s motions to transfer petitions challenging the \ndisapproval action.  Pet. App. 17a.  But the court con-\ncluded that those courts had \u201cstrayed from \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \ntext and instead applied a petition-focused approach\u201d \nthat considered the scope of the petitioners\u2019 challenge \nrather than the face of the agency action itself.  Ibid.  \nThe court also noted that the contrary decisions of those \nother circuits had \u201cgenerated strong dissents highlight-\ning critical flaws in the majority opinions.\u201d  Id. at 18a.   \nBecause the court of appeals concluded that the dis-\napproval action is nationally applicable, the court de-\nclined to address EPA\u2019s alternative argument that the \nrule \u201cis based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a n.8 (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)).   \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals transferred the petitions to the \nD.C. Circuit.  That court subsequently ordered that the \ncases be held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision.  \n23-1103 Order (Nov. 6, 2024).  The disapproval action \nremains stayed as to Oklahoma and Utah pending judi-\ncial review.   \n3. The other regional circuits issued interlocutory \nmotions-panel decisions that either denied transfer or \nreferred the venue question to the merits panel.  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323 (4th Cir. 2024) (denying \ntransfer motion); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL \n7204840 (5th Cir. May 1, 2023) (per curiam) (same); \nKentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2023 WL 11871967 (6th \nCir. July 25, 2023) (same); 23-1320 Order, Arkansas v. \nEPA (8th Cir. Apr. 25, 2023) (same); 23-682 Order, Ne-\nvada Cement Co. v. EPA (9th Cir. July 3, 2023) (refer-\nring the venue question to the merits panel); 23-11173 \nOrder, Alabama v. EPA (11th Cir. July 12, 2023) \n(same).   \nAfter this Court granted certiorari, a merits panel of \nthe Sixth Circuit held that it had venue over Kentucky\u2019s \nchallenge to EPA\u2019s disapproval action, and the court va-\ncated the disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on the merits.  \nKentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447 (2024).   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the dis-\napproval action here is reviewable only in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments impose atextual \nrequirements and fail to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To determine \nwhether a particular EPA action is \u201cnationally applica-\n\n13 \n \nble,\u201d a court must consider the action on its face.  The \ndisapproval action here is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d be-\ncause it addresses state plan submissions from 21 \nStates in ten federal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, petitioners \nseek to impose atextual restrictions on the availability \nof D.C. Circuit review.  Petitioners argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat EPA\u2019s disapproval of \neach State\u2019s plan submission as a separate \u201cfinal ac-\ntion.\u201d  But this Court has long recognized that agencies \nhave discretion to devise their own procedures, includ-\ning by aggregating common issues for joint resolution.  \nEPA acted reasonably in taking that approach here.  And \n\n14 \n \nin determining the proper venue for challenges to the \nagency\u2019s disapproval action, the Court should focus on \nthe action that EPA actually took, rather than on a hy-\npothetical array of 21 separate, State-specific disapprov-\nals. \nPetitioners also assert that the disapproval action \nmust be \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d because Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) specifically channels to the \u201cappropriate \ncircuit\u201d an EPA action \u201capproving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any other final action  * * *  \nunder [the CAA] (including any denial or disapproval \n[under title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But that language \ndoes not say that a denial or disapproval action is locally \nor regionally applicable.  It merely provides that a chal-\nlenge to any such action \u201cwhich is locally or regionally \napplicable may be filed only in the  . . .  appropriate re-\ngional circuit\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 11a-12a n.5 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1)) (brackets omitted).  Whether a particular \ndenial or disapproval is locally or regionally applicable \nis for the reviewing court to decide. \nB. Even if this Court disregards the framing of the \ndisapproval action and views EPA\u2019s disapproval of each \nState\u2019s plan as a distinct \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, those actions are still reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  EPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d and EPA published its finding to that effect in ac-\ncordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn linking proper venue to a \u201cdetermination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on \nthe underlying reasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d \n\n15 \n \nthe relevant determinations, indicating that the deter-\nminations must be a but-for cause of the agency\u2019s final \naction\u2014forming the core of the agency\u2019s analysis.  To \nbe nationwide in scope or effect, the core justifications \nfor EPA\u2019s final action must be intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the \ncountry, or have legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nThe disapproval action here meets those require-\nments.  The disapproval action is based on determinations \nthat have nationwide scope and effect, including:  (1) \nEPA\u2019s decision to use updated, 2016-based modeling in \nassessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion across the country; (2) EPA\u2019s decision to apply a \n1% contribution threshold to each State to assess \nwhether the State contributed more than a de minimis \namount of ozone pollution downwind; (3) EPA\u2019s deter-\nmination that the relative magnitude of other sources\u2019 \ncontributions to nonattainment in downwind States \ncould not justify inaction by the upwind States at issue; \nand (4) EPA\u2019s position that a linked State cannot rely \non current controls or anticipated emissions reductions \nthat are not incorporated into the state plans them-\nselves.  Those determinations formed the core of EPA\u2019s \nanalysis in rejecting the state plan submissions, and the \nagency relied on each determination in acting on Good \nNeighbor plan submissions across the country.    \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the disapproval action would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\n16 \n \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA established a uni-\nform legal framework for state implementation plans \nspanning multiple States in multiple judicial circuits.  In \namending the statute to its current form, Congress \nadopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel, who urged that challenges to such actions \nshould be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccentralize \nreview\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Circuit\u2019s] ad-\nministrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitating an or-\nderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA would ap-\nply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 (Dec. 30, \n1976).   \nPetitioners contend that the statutory term \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d refers only to the ultimate disposition of the \nmatter before the agency.  But that reading erases the \ndistinction that Section 7607(b)(1) draws between the \nagency \u201caction\u201d and the \u201cdetermination\u201d on which the \naction is \u201cbased.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners fur-\nther observe that EPA also considered State-specific \nfacts in disapproving each of the state plan submissions \nhere.  But the statute\u2019s third prong is not limited to \nEPA actions that are based solely on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a limitation \nmake sense.  The third prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \ncomes into play only when the challenged EPA action is \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and such actions al-\nmost always will rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Ibid.    \nPetitioners are also incorrect in asserting that EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation would authorize D.C. Circuit venue for \nchallenges to every locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n17 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DISAPPROVAL ACTION  \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to ex-\nclusive D.C. Circuit review.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \neven if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. Circuit if \nthat action is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect and if in taking such action the Adminis-\ntrator finds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause EPA\u2019s disapproval action addresses the \nstate plan submissions of 21 States across the country, \nthe action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the meaning \nof Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if (as petition-\ners urge) the Court views the disapproval action as com-\nprising 21 separate \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \nstate plan disapprovals, those disapprovals are still re-\nviewable only in the D.C. Circuit because they are based \non determinations of nationwide scope and effect.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan was grounded in \nEPA\u2019s determinations regarding the proper implemen-\ntation of the Good Neighbor requirements that are im-\nposed on States throughout the country and that affect \n\n18 \n \nthe legal obligations of downwind and upwind States in \nmultiple judicial circuits. \nThe numerous challenges to the disapproval action, \nbrought in eight judicial circuits across the country, il-\nlustrate the outcome that Section 7607(b)(1) was intended \nto prevent.  In arguing for regional-circuit venue, States \nand industry participants have emphasized the State-\nspecific factors that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval \nof various state plans.  In briefing their challenges on \nthe merits, however, those States and industry partici-\npants have focused primarily on EPA\u2019s nationwide de-\nterminations, causing eight different courts of appeals \nto expend resources considering nearly identical chal-\nlenges.   \nBoth because it governs state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits, and because it rests on EPA determina-\ntions that apply nationwide, the disapproval action is \nprecisely the type of EPA action that Congress re-\ngarded as appropriate for centralized D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  Under petitioners\u2019 venue analysis, however, sim-\nilar EPA actions would continue to spawn parallel chal-\nlenges in multiple circuits, wasting judicial resources \nand heightening the risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Con-\ngress crafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and \nthis Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.   \nA. The Disapproval Action Is Nationally Applicable \nThe disapproval action addressed the state plan sub-\nmissions of 21 States located in multiple judicial circuits \nacross the country.  It therefore is apparent on the face \nof the final action that it is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and sub-\nject to review in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nPetitioners\u2019 contrary arguments lack merit.   \n\n19 \n \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the disapproval action is nationally \napplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the disapproval action at issue here be-\ncause that action applies to state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits across the country.  The statutory context \nand history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. Cir-\ncuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis meant \nto cover comprehensively every manner in which an \nagency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And under \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the choice between D.C. \nCircuit and regional-circuit venue turns on the nature \nof the pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for \na particular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n12a; Hunt Ref. Co. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. \n2024); Southern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, \n671 (7th Cir. 2017); American Road & Transp. Builders \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK \nLaunch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. \n2011).  Courts thus must look to the face of the action \nand determine whether it applies to\u2014or includes \n\u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 91 (5th ed. \n1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201capply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout \n[the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 1505 (1976) (Web-\nster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnationally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\n\n20 \n \nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \n \n4 Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n21 \n \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions for which the 1970 statute specified D.C. \nCircuit review were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d and Con-\ngress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven and \nconsistent national application.\u201d  1970 Senate Report \n41.  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approv-\ning or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run \nonly to one air quality control region\u201d as amenable to \nreview \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in \nwhich the affected air quality control region, or portion \nthereof, is located,\u201d ibid., which the statute referred to \nas \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) \n(1970).   \n\n22 \n \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  The House Report con-\ntrasted such local actions with nationally relevant ac-\ntions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d and \ntherefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Circuit \nreview.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the conclu-\nsion that, under the venue provision in its current form, \nfinal EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple judi-\ncial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the disap-\nproval action is nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] \nits power\u201d through a single final action that applies to \nsubmissions from 21 States across the country, span-\nning ten federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 U.S. at \n478; see Pet. App. 12a.  On a plain-text understanding, \nthe disapproval action is therefore \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d and petitioners\u2019 challenges to the action can pro-\nceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary approach to venue is incon-\nsistent with the statutory text  \nPetitioners argue that the disapproval action is not \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d because it should be viewed for \nvenue purposes as 21 separate disapprovals of 21 state \nplan submissions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Petitioners further contend that the dis-\napproval action must be locally or regionally applicable \n\n23 \n \nbecause Section 7607(b)(1) specifically refers to a denial \nor disapproval as an example of a locally or regionally \napplicable action.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. Petitioners contend (State Br. 22-26; Industry Br. \n32-33) that, for purposes of the venue provision, the rel-\nevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is not the single disapproval action \napplicable to 21 States, but rather 21 separate actions \ndisapproving individual state plans.  That argument dis-\nregards EPA\u2019s decision to consider and rule on the var-\nious state plans together, and it is untethered to the \nstatutory text.   \nPetitioners assert (State Br. 23; Industry Br. 32-33) \nthat each individual plan disapproval must be a review-\nable final action because Section 7410 requires \u201c[e]ach \nState\u201d to develop \u201ca plan\u201d to implement the NAAQS \nand requires EPA to \u201cact[] on the submission.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(a)(1) and (k)(2) (emphases added).  The \nstatute\u2019s use of singular articles makes sense because \neach State submits a single plan, and EPA must assess \neach State\u2019s submission.  But neither Section 7410 nor \nany other CAA provision restricts EPA\u2019s ability to con-\nsider state plan submissions together and resolve com-\nmon issues in a single final action.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple state implementation plans in a single action.  \nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that administra-\ntive agencies \u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules \nof procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable \nof permitting them to discharge their multitudinous du-\nties.\u201d  FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, \n\n24 \n \n143 (1940); see Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, \n524 (1978) (\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four dec-\nades emphasized that the formulation of procedures \nwas basically to be left within the discretion of the agen-\ncies to which Congress had confided the responsibility \nfor substantive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes \nthe ability to determine \u201cwhether applications should be \nheard contemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, \n309 U.S. at 138.  Section 7410\u2019s reference to individual \nstate plan submissions is an insufficient basis for infer-\nring any constraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to group similar \nplan submissions for joint resolution.   \nNor is it relevant that EPA issued separate notices \nof proposed disapprovals for certain States.  See Indus-\ntry Br. 42-43.  Section 7607(b)(1) focuses on the \u201cfinal \naction taken,\u201d not on a proposed or hypothetical action \nthat EPA could have taken.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various state plan submissions to \ndecide the common issues that affect States across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336, 1998 WL 827315 \nat *2 (4th Cir. 1998) (Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA ac-\ntion declaring that 22 States\u2019 implementation plans \n\n25 \n \nwere inadequate and required revisions).  Indeed, such \naggregation generally is encouraged as a means of effi-\nciently adjudicating common issues.  See Committee on \nAdjudication, Administrative Conference of the United \nStates, Aggregation of Similar Claims in Agency Adju-\ndication (June 13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F.   \nConsistent with those principles, for more than 20 \nyears, EPA\u2019s practice generally has been to take a sin-\ngle final action covering multiple States when address-\ning interstate ozone requirements.  See, e.g., 63 Fed. \nReg. 57,356, 57,480 (Oct. 27, 1998).  By contrast, EPA \ntypically acts individually on most other state plan sub-\nmissions under 42 U.S.C. 7410, because most such sub-\nmissions do not raise nationally significant issues.  See, \ne.g., American Road & Transp. Builders, 705 F.3d at \n455 (Kavanaugh, J.); North Dakota v. EPA, 730 F.3d \n750, 757 (8th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1135 \n(2014).  Courts have recognized that an action address-\ning a single State\u2019s implementation plan \u201cis the proto-\ntypical \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 action\u201d under \nSection 7607(b)(1).  American Road & Transp. Build-\ners, 705 F.3d at 455; see Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th \n738, 744 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  But those decisions do not ad-\ndress EPA actions considering common issues involved \nin multiple state plans dealing with interstate ozone \ntransport.  Whether EPA acts on multiple plan submis-\nsions together or instead acts on a single submission, it \nis the face of the final action that determines the proper \nvenue for review.5  \n \n5 Petitioners allege that EPA has been inconsistent in treating \nsome multistate plan approvals as locally or regionally applicable.  \nSee State Br. 28 (citing 85 Fed. Reg. 20,165 (Apr. 10, 2020); 86 Fed. \nReg. 68,413 (Dec. 2, 2021)).  EPA stated in those actions that chal-\n \n\n26 \n \nPetitioners\u2019 position would require a reviewing court \nto look beyond the face of the action and potentially sub-\nstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit of \nanalysis.  But petitioners provide little guidance on how \ncourts would make that determination.  Lower courts \nconfronted with such arguments have generally re-\njected requests to reframe EPA\u2019s action and have fo-\ncused solely on the face of the final agency action.  See, \ne.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 387 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that EPA\u2019s \nconstruction and application to a specific context of \u201cna-\ntionally applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act\u201d ren-\ndered the agency action itself nationally applicable); Si-\nerra Club, 47 F.4th at 744 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state plans were \nnationally applicable because EPA had announced a \nnew understanding that would apply in other locations, \nthereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s national \nimplementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power Coop., \n863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were an \n\u201camalgamation of many different locally or regionally \napplicable agency actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at \n1374 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that an allocation \nof allowances among entities should be considered a \n\u201cdocument detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources in resolving threshold issues, and furthering \n \nlenges should be filed in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  See, e.g., 86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,420.  But EPA did not make any particular finding as to \nthe geographic applicability of those actions, and Section 7607(b)(1) \ndid not require it to do so.  \n\n27 \n \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Petitioners\u2019 approach, by contrast, \nwould \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the deter-\nmination of venue, where the need for clear rules is es-\npecially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at \n673.   \nPetitioners contend (State Br. 30-31; Industry Br. \n43-45) that permitting EPA to aggregate disapprovals \nwould result in EPA manipulating venue by combining \nunrelated agency actions.  But petitioners do not and \ncould not plausibly claim that EPA engaged in any such \narbitrary aggregation here.  Nor do they identify any \nprior instance when EPA has grouped otherwise unre-\nlated local actions for decision and then argued that \nvenue lay in the D.C. Circuit.  If the agency ever did so, \nthe principle we advocate here\u2014i.e., that reviewing \ncourts in determining venue should ordinarily accept \nEPA\u2019s framing of its own action\u2014would not preclude a \ncourt from rejecting a particular grouping to manipu-\nlate venue.  Cf. In re Samsung Electronics Co., 2 F.4th \n1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1445 \n(2022) (noting that courts \u201chave repeatedly assessed the \npropriety of venue by disregarding manipulative activi-\nties of the parties\u201d).  \nb. Petitioners also argue (State Br. 26-29; Industry \nBr. 33-34) that EPA\u2019s disapproval action must be \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d because Section 7607(b)(1) \nspecifically assigns EPA actions \u201capproving or promul-\ngating any implementation plan\u201d or \u201cden[ying] or dis-\napprov[ing]\u201d an implementation plan to review in \u201cthe \nappropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners \nmisread the statutory language.  See Pet. App. 11a-12a \nn.5.   \n\n28 \n \nThe first prong of Section 7607(b)(1) states that var-\nious specified EPA actions\u2014such as NAAQS, emissions \nstandards for hazardous air pollutants, and vehicle \nemissions standards\u2014are reviewable \u201conly in\u201d the D.C. \nCircuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The first prong also con-\ntains a broad catchall reference to \u201cany other nationally \napplicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken\u201d \nunder the CAA, and those actions likewise are subject \nto exclusive D.C. Circuit review.  Ibid.  The first prong\u2019s \ncatchall reference to \u201cany other nationally applicable\u201d \nactions, ibid. (emphasis added), indicates that Congress \nviewed the preceding specified actions themselves as \nnationally applicable. \nThe second prong has a similar structure, with a list \nof enumerated actions followed by a catchall.  Within \nthe second prong, however, the EPA action at issue \nhere\u2014i.e., a \u201cdenial or disapproval  * * *  under [title I \nof the CAA],\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)\u2014is not one of the \nspecific actions referenced before the catchall.  Rather, \nthe second prong\u2019s reference to an EPA \u201cdenial or dis-\napproval\u201d is contained in a parenthetical within the \ncatchall.  See ibid. (referring to \u201cany other final action  \n* * *  (including any denial or disapproval  * * *  under \n[title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally appli-\ncable\u201d).  That language indicates that EPA denials and \ndisapprovals are subject to the same venue analysis that \napplies to \u201cother final action[s]\u201d generally.  Thus, if a \nparticular denial or disapproval is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d it is subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But whether a particular \ndisapproval is locally or regionally applicable is for the \nreviewing court to decide.   \nPetitioners argue (State Br. 27) that Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s second prong specifically identifies EPA \n\n29 \n \napprovals of implementation plans as \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable,\u201d and that \u201cit would make little sense to \nthink that disapprovals of the same implementation \nplans should be litigated in a different venue.\u201d  That ar-\ngument ignores Congress\u2019s decision to include plan ap-\nprovals, but not plan disapprovals, in the list of enumer-\nated EPA actions at the beginning of the second prong.  \nIn any event, in listing actions like the \u201capproval or \npromulgation\u201d of an implementation plan, Congress had \nin mind actions that \u201crun only to one air quality control \nregion.\u201d  1970 Senate Report 41.  The second prong\u2019s \nreference to an EPA \u201caction in approving  * * *  any \nimplementation plan,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded), could reasonably be read as limited to the \nagency\u2019s approval of a single plan.  Under that reading, \nan EPA action approving multiple state plans would fall \noutside the enumerated categories, so that venue would \nbe governed by Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s catchalls. \nCiting the ejusdem generis canon, petitioners sug-\ngest (State Br. 25; Industry Br. 31-32) that the disap-\nproval action at issue here cannot fall under the catchall \nphrase \u201cany other nationally applicable  * * *  final ac-\ntion\u201d because the enumerated actions preceding that \nphrase necessarily span the entire country rather than \na subset of States.  But as the statutory context and his-\ntory show, see pp. 19-22, supra, an action need not apply \nto all 50 States to be \u201cnationally applicable.\u201d  And some \nof the enumerated actions referenced in Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong can, and regularly do, apply to \nfewer than 50 States.  For example, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nfirst prong refers to the regulation of fuels under Sec-\ntion 7545, even though certain controls or prohibitions \napply only in nonattainment areas, which are not pre-\n\n30 \n \nsent in every State.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(h)(1), (h)(6), and \n(k)(1)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(10)(D). \nAccordingly, courts have deemed various EPA ac-\ntions that applied in fewer than all 50 States, including \nnonattainment designations and calls for state imple-\nmentation plans, to be nationally applicable under Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong.  See, e.g., ATK Launch \nSys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated States\u2019 recommended nonattain-\nment designations and promulgated final designations \nfor 31 areas in 18 States across the country); Browner, \n1998 WL 827315 at *2 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated 22 state plans and declared them \ninadequate, requiring revisions); Texas v. EPA, No. 10-\n60961, 2011 WL 710598, at *2 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) \n(same as to 13 States).  Like those actions, the disap-\nproval action at issue here is nationally applicable on its \nface.  After evaluating submissions from 21 States \nacross the country, EPA ultimately concluded, \u201cbased \non a common core of nationwide policy judgments and \ntechnical analysis,\u201d that each State had failed to ade-\nquately prohibit emissions that will significantly con-\ntribute to downwind nonattainment of the 2015 ozone \nNAAQS.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \nB.  The Disapproval Action Is Based On Determinations Of \nNationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s disapproval \naction should be viewed for venue purposes as 21 dis-\ncrete disapprovals of 21 state plans, and that each such \ndisapproval is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d EPA\u2019s \naction still is reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each state plan was \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA \npublished a finding to that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n\n31 \n \n1.  The disapproval action at issue here was based on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nonly in the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA published the requisite finding, see 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9380-9381, and that finding was correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \ndetermination of that kind forms the basis of the action.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \n\n32 \n \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n461-462.  Applying that definition in the context of \nagency action, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination \nrefers to the legal consequences that determination \nproduces.  Thus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Cir-\ncuit review when EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core \njustification a principle or conclusion that is intended to \ngovern the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions through-\nout the country, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s \nfinal action has legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \n\n33 \n \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A) (requiring ap-\nplication of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to partic-\nular EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \n\n34 \n \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is best equipped \nto evaluate a particular agency action\u2014e.g., because \nchallenges are likely to focus on local or regional issues \n\u2014EPA may decline to publish the relevant finding, \nthereby ensuring that the regional circuit will have \nvenue over any challenge to the action. \nb. The disapproval action here was \u201cbased on\u201d at \nleast four \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in scope because they uniformly resolved is-\nsues regarding the appropriate application of the Good \nNeighbor Provision to plans submitted by States in \nmultiple judicial circuits.  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in effect because they produced legal conse-\nquences for States nationwide, affecting their obliga-\ntions as upwind emission sources and downwind emis-\nsion receptors.  And the final action was \u201cbased on\u201d the \ndeterminations because those determinations formed \nthe core of EPA\u2019s disapproval of the state plans.   \nFirst, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \nrely on updated, 2016-based modeling as the \u201cprimary\u201d \nbasis for its \u201cassessment of air quality conditions and \npollution contribution.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA \nused that modeling of conditions across the country in \nconsidering all of the 21 state plan submissions.  And \n\n35 \n \nthat modeling affected the manner in which responsibil-\nity for achieving compliance with the ozone NAAQS was \nallocated between upwind and downwind States.   \nSecond, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \napply a 1% contribution threshold across all States to \nassess whether a State contributed more than a de min-\nimis amount of ozone pollution downwind.  88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9371; see J.A. 251a-259a.  Although EPA considered \nadopting different thresholds for different States, EPA \nconcluded that a uniform threshold nationwide was \u201ces-\nsential\u201d for interstate ozone transport, which requires \n\u201ca unique degree of concern for consistency, parity, and \nequity across state lines\u201d in order to equitably allocate \nresponsibility for ozone pollution among all States.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9373-9374.   \nThird, EPA determined that the relative contribu-\ntions of other States or countries could not excuse a \nState from analyzing whether its own emissions \u201csignif-\nicantly\u201d contribute to downwind nonattainment.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9378.  EPA explained that the Good Neigh-\nbor provision requires all States to address their signif-\nicant contributions, and that \u201c[w]hether emissions from \nother states or other countries also contribute\u201d to the \ndownwind air quality issue \u201cis typically not relevant in \nassessing\u201d whether a State is significantly contributing \nto the problem and therefore must curb its emissions.  \nIbid.   \nFourth and finally, EPA determined that, once a \nState is identified as \u201clinked,\u201d the State cannot rely on \nemission-reduction measures that are not actually in-\ncorporated into its state plan.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9376-\n9377.  EPA explained that many States had claimed \nemission-reduction measures that were already ac-\ncounted for in EPA\u2019s modeling.  EPA therefore declined \n\n36 \n \nto \u201cdouble-count[]\u201d those measures by considering them, \nat step three of its analysis, as measures that would \neliminate significant contribution.  Id. at 9377.  EPA \nalso explained that States could not simply point to an-\nticipated upcoming reductions where such measures \nhave not been \u201crendered enforceable\u201d by inclusion \nwithin the state plan itself, because such measures \ncould then be \u201cmodified or amended in ways that would \nundermine the basis for the state\u2019s reliance on them.\u201d  \nId. at 9376.   \nEach of those determinations had nationwide scope, \nas each governed EPA\u2019s assessment of state plan sub-\nmissions across the country.  The determinations also \nhad nationwide effect because an EPA decision con-\ncerning one State\u2019s Good Neighbor plan can affect the \nlegal obligations of other States, particularly those \ndownwind.  Those effects are a consequence of the in-\nterwoven linkages across the country that characterize \ninterstate ozone transport, and of the CAA requirement \nthat every State must come into compliance with the \nNAAQS by the statutory deadline.  See Wisconsin v. \nEPA, 938 F.3d 303, 313 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam); 42 \nU.S.C. 7511(a)(1); J.A. 268a-272a.  As a result of the \nlinkages, EPA\u2019s assessment of upwind States\u2019 imple-\nmentation plans and the control measures necessary for \nthose States to comply with Good Neighbor obligations \nnecessarily affects the amount of emissions for which \nthe downwind States (and potentially other linked up-\nwind States) will be responsible.   \nFor example, 25.8% of the ozone in Galveston \nCounty, Texas comes from upwind States, with contri-\nbutions above the 1% threshold from Alabama, Arkan-\n\n37 \n \nsas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.6  All five \nlinked States concluded for various reasons that they do \nnot significantly contribute to ozone pollution in Texas.  \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9355, 9357-9359.  If EPA had \napplied the higher threshold that various States advo-\ncated, so that particular upwind States were not re-\nquired to reduce their own emissions, Texas would have \nbeen required to make up the difference necessary to \nattain the NAAQS in Galveston. \nThat example likewise illustrates that EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval action was \u201cbased on\u201d its nationwide determina-\ntions.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regarding \nthe updated modeling data and appropriate threshold \ndrove EPA\u2019s conclusions regarding the linkages among \nall States.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regard-\ning relative contributions drove EPA\u2019s conclusions re-\ngarding whether a State had adequately analyzed its \n\u201csignificant contribution.\u201d  And application of EPA\u2019s de-\ntermination regarding relevant emissions-reduction \nmeasures drove EPA\u2019s conclusions as to whether state \nplans must incorporate additional measures to address \nsignificant contributions.  Those determinations were \nessential to EPA\u2019s reasoning in disapproving the state \nplans.   \nThe Sixth Circuit recently concluded that EPA\u2019s de-\ncision to rely on updated modeling and the 1% contribu-\ntion threshold was arbitrary and capricious, and the \ncourt vacated EPA\u2019s disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on \nthat basis.  Kentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447, 473 (2024); \nsee id. at 467-471.  Although the Sixth Circuit rejected \nthe government\u2019s argument that venue for the chal-\nlenge lay in the D.C. Circuit, see id. at 457-467, the \n \n6 See EPA, Air Quality Modeling Technical Support Document: \n2015 Ozone NAAQS C-2-C-3, D-2, https://perma.cc/Z955-CHD7.   \n\n38 \n \ncourt\u2019s merits analysis logically implies that the chal-\nlenged disapproval action is \u201cbased on\u201d the nationwide \ndeterminations.  If (as the Sixth Circuit held) judicial \ninvalidation of the relevant determinations provided a \nsufficient basis for finding the final action itself to be \n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-\nwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), then the determinations are properly \nviewed as a \u201cnecessary logical condition\u201d of the action, \nSafeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the requisite causal relation-\nship exists.7   \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like the one at issue here to be \nreviewable in the D.C. Circuit.   \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977).  Parties \nfaced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \u201cthe ap-\npropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a final \naction pertaining to state implementation plans submit-\n \n7 EPA argued in Kentucky that the possible invalidity of particu-\nlar agency determinations would be \u201charmless\u201d because the agency \nwould have disapproved Kentucky\u2019s plan even without those deter-\nminations.  See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 471.  The Sixth Circuit re-\njected that argument.  See id. at 471-472.  In any event, other na-\ntionwide EPA determinations described above (see pp. 34-36, su-\npra), and the four specified nationwide determinations taken to-\ngether, indisputably were a but-for cause of EPA\u2019s decision to dis-\napprove the 21 state plans. \n\n39 \n \nted by multiple States spanning multiple judicial cir-\ncuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved or disapproved (in whole or in part) numerous \nstate implementation plans, based on the agency\u2019s de-\nterminations that the plan submission and attainment \ndeadlines for certain pollutants should be extended, giv-\ning States more time to adopt the necessary control \nmeasures.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. \nEPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (per cu-\nriam); 37 Fed. Reg. 10,842 (May 31, 1972). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \npossible inconsistent and delayed results on the merits, \ncan only serve to frustrate the strong Congressional in-\nterest in improving the environment.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 495 \n(1972) (per curiam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explain-\ning that \u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \n\u201cinvolve facts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; \nrather, all concern uniform determinations of nation-\nwide effect made by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \n\n40 \n \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \n\n41 \n \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses an individual State\u2014including by assessing its \nimplementation plan\u2014judicial review of the action may \nimplicate national concerns.  After considering the com-\npeting viewpoints expressed by ACUS and Frick as to \nthe proper means of resolving those national issues, \nCongress opted to authorize uniform resolution by \nproviding a mechanism for exclusive D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary reasoning would render the \u201cna-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \npractically insignificant \nIn arguing that EPA did not make any determina-\ntions of nationwide scope or effect, petitioners attempt \nto limit the relevant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s ul-\ntimate decision.  Petitioners further focus on the State-\nspecific circumstances that EPA also considered in the \ncourse of assessing the various implementation plans.  \nPetitioners\u2019 approach is inconsistent with the statutory \ntext and would severely undercut the intended reach of \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Under the correct in-\nterpretation of the statute, that prong has both mean-\ningful reach and meaningful limits, each designed to \nfurther Congress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. \nCircuit those challenges that are likely to raise issues of \nnational importance.   \na. Petitioners contend that, for an EPA action to \nqualify for D.C. Circuit review under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong, the relevant nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d \nmust be the \u201c\u200a\u2018ultimate decision\u2019\u200a\u201d of the final action, such \nthat the court should ask whether the \u201c\u200a\u2018final action\u2019 has \na \u2018nationwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d   State Br. 41 (citations \nomitted); see Industry Br. 47-49.  That argument would \neliminate the statute\u2019s distinction between the final \u201cac-\n\n42 \n \ntion\u201d and the relevant \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it would ul-\ntimately render Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong mean-\ningless.   \nIn applying the first two prongs of Section 7607(b)(1), \nthe Court must consider whether EPA\u2019s disapproval ac-\ntion itself is nationally applicable or instead is locally or \nregionally applicable.  Application of the third prong, by \ncontrast, does not turn on the nature of EPA\u2019s ultimate \naction disapproving the various state plans.  Rather, the \nthird prong potentially applies only if the Court finds \nthe disapproval action itself to be \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d and that prong\u2019s applicability depends on \nEPA\u2019s stated reasons for disapproving the state plans.  \nThe methodological determinations identified above \ngoverned EPA\u2019s analysis of state implementation plans \nacross the country and ultimately affected the legal ob-\nligations of upwind and downwind States nationally.  \nSee pp. 34-37, supra.  And because EPA applied those \ndeterminations to each of the 21 state plan submissions, \nEPA\u2019s finding that the disapproval was based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect remains valid, \nwhether the relevant agency action is viewed as the sin-\ngle combined disapproval action or instead as 21 State-\nspecific disapprovals.  Contra Industry Br. 49-51.   \nThe history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong fur-\nther supports an interpretation that distinguishes be-\ntween EPA\u2019s final \u201caction\u201d and the agency\u2019s underlying \n\u201cdetermination[s].\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In amending \nthe venue provision to incorporate that prong, Congress \nadopted the recommendation of EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel Frick.  Frick cited the Natural Resources De-\nfense Council litigation, in which EPA had acted on var-\nious state plans while granting \u201ctwo-year extensions of \nthe date for attainment of national ambient air quality \n\n43 \n \nstandards in a number of metropolitan areas.\u201d  41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,769.  There, the relevant determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect were EPA\u2019s decisions to ex-\ntend compliance deadlines, not the agency\u2019s ultimate \napproval or disapproval of the various state plans.  See \npp. 38-40, supra.   \nPetitioners\u2019 conflation of the relevant \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d and the final action would also drain Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong of any practical significance.  \nAs explained, that prong potentially applies only to \nEPA actions that are locally or regionally applicable, ra-\nther than nationally applicable.  But if the relevant de-\ntermination were essentially equivalent to the final ac-\ntion, it is difficult to imagine an action that would not be \nnationally applicable under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first \nprong, but that would qualify as nationwide in scope or \neffect.  Petitioners argue (State Br. 39, 41; Industry Br. \n46-47) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong should be \nread narrowly because it establishes an exception to a \ngeneral rule of regional-circuit review of locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions.  But \u201cthis Court has made \nclear that statutory exceptions are to be read fairly, not \nnarrowly, for they \u2018are no less part of Congress\u2019s work \nthan its rules and standards\u2014and all are worthy of a \ncourt\u2019s respect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  HollyFrontier Cheyenne Ref., LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, 395-396 (2021) (ci-\ntation omitted). \nFairly read, the plain text of the third prong does not \nlimit the relevant determination to the \u201cultimate dispo-\nsition\u201d or otherwise equate it to the final action under \nreview.  Rather, the statute distinguishes between the \nchallenged EPA action itself and the agency\u2019s stated \nreasons for taking that action.  The third prong reflects \nCongress\u2019s recognition that centralized review of EPA\u2019s \n\n44 \n \nnationwide legal or policy judgments may be appropri-\nate even when such judgments are challenged in a peti-\ntion for review of a local agency action.  To the extent \nthe Court views the disapproval action as locally or re-\ngionally applicable, that principle is directly implicated \nhere.   \nb. Petitioners assert (State Br. 47-51; Industry Br. \n51-54) that the disapproval action falls outside Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong because the States\u2019 plan sub-\nmissions and EPA\u2019s analysis had State-specific aspects.  \nBut the State-specific analyses petitioners highlight \nlargely reflect the application of the nationwide deter-\nminations to each State\u2019s circumstances.  For example, \npetitioners note (State Br. 48; Industry Br. 51) Utah\u2019s \nargument during the administrative proceedings that it \nneed not reduce its contributions to Colorado-based re-\nceptors because its contribution was minimal in compar-\nison to those of other emissions sources.  But EPA re-\njected that argument\u2014made by numerous other States \n\u2014based on EPA\u2019s nationwide determination that the \nrelative magnitude of contributions from other sources \ndoes not relieve States of their Good Neighbor obliga-\ntions.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9378-9379.  Similarly, petitioners \nemphasize (State Br. 47; Industry Br. 52) Oklahoma\u2019s \nargument that existing emission-reduction measures \nwere sufficient to meet its Good Neighbor obligations.  \nBut again, many other States made the same argument, \nand EPA concluded that no linked State could meet its \nGood Neighbor obligations simply by relying on exist-\ning control measures or anticipated reductions that are \nnot incorporated into enforceable state plans.  See 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9343, 9377.   \nIn treating EPA\u2019s need to consider State-specific cir-\ncumstances as controlling the venue inquiry, petitioners \n\n45 \n \nwould effectively limit D.C. Circuit venue under Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong to review of EPA actions that \nare based solely on determinations of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Nothing in the statutory text supports that \napproach.  Where Congress intended to require such a \nlimitation, it said so explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (providing an exception to the statute\u2019s 60-\nday filing window where the \u201cpetition is based solely on \ngrounds arising after\u201d that time period expires) (em-\nphasis added); cf. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in \nother statutes, [Congress] could have added \u2018solely\u2019 to \nindicate that actions taken \u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence \nof multiple factors do not violate the law.\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nOnce again, petitioners\u2019 approach would render the \n\u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d prong practically insignifi-\ncant and is inconsistent with the statutory history.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  By its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong applies only to actions that are \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can \nbe expected to rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Yet on petitioners\u2019 \nview, EPA\u2019s consideration of such circumstances is suf-\nficient to preclude D.C. Circuit review.  And as ex-\nplained above (see pp. 38-41, supra), Congress enacted \nSection 7607(b)(1) in its current form after then- \nGeneral Counsel Frick specifically highlighted the fact \nthat EPA\u2019s approval of plans for individual States\u2014\nwhich necessarily rest at least in part on State-specific \ncircumstances\u2014can also raise issues of national signifi-\ncance for which D.C. Circuit review is appropriate.  See \n41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  Petitioners\u2019 interpretation thus \ncontravenes Congress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review \nof national issues in the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing ef-\n\n46 \n \nficient resolution of those issues, even when the actions \nalso address local or regional concerns.   \nc. Petitioners contend (State Br. 54; Industry Br. \n55) that adopting EPA\u2019s interpretation would allow \nD.C. Circuit venue for challenges to every locally or re-\ngionally applicable EPA action.  That is incorrect.  The \nstatutory text includes significant limitations that pre-\nvent that result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 31-32, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 33, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already explained, \nibid., that causation requirement is satisfied here\u2014but \nit will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \n\n47 \n \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments  \nreflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the nation-\nwide rule, policy, or interpretation itself is likely to be \ncalled into question in any judicial challenge to the EPA \naction, routing such challenges to the D.C. Circuit \nserves important interests in judicial efficiency and na-\ntionwide uniformity.  That is particularly so if the rele-\nvant EPA determination is intended to govern future \nagency actions across the country.  But where the valid-\nity of the general rule or policy appears to be settled, \nsuch that any judicial challenges to the action are likely \nto focus on the application of the general pronounce-\nment to discrete local facts, those interests are inappo-\nsite. \nHere, EPA made each of the relevant determinations \nin the disapproval action itself, after considering com-\nments disputing their validity.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at \n9365-9367, 9370-9375, 9376-9378.  While the determina-\ntions may be consistent with EPA\u2019s prior implementa-\ntion of other NAAQS, EPA did not simply apply exist-\ning rules or standards; rather, its determinations re-\nsolved controversies over specific methodological issues \nthat were vigorously contested.  EPA\u2019s conclusions sup-\nporting the disapproval action therefore are properly \n\n48 \n \nviewed as \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d within the meaning of Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1).   \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \npp. 33-34, supra.  For example, EPA may consider \nwhether any petitions for review of a particular action \nwould likely contest EPA determinations of national \nconcern, or instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s under-\nstanding of local or regional circumstances.  For EPA \nactions in the latter category, the agency may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action.   \nd. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that are subject to D.C. Circuit review, while al-\nlowing efficient and uniform resolution of disputed is-\nsues of national significance.  By contrast, petitioners\u2019 \ninterpretation would limit D.C. Circuit review of locally \nor regionally applicable EPA actions to a vanishingly \nsmall category.  Embracing petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nwould lead to the very problems Congress sought to \navoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue provision to include \nthe nationwide-scope-or-effect language.   \nThis case is illustrative.  Because multiple circuits \nhave declined to transfer challenges to the D.C. Circuit, \n\n49 \n \nEPA has been litigating substantially similar challenges \nto the disapproval action in eight courts of appeals.  Ra-\nther than focusing their challenges on State-specific \nfindings that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval of par-\nticular state plans, the petitioners in all of those cases \nhave primarily contested the legality of the same core \ndeterminations that EPA adopted and applied nation-\nwide.   \nConsideration of the same basic legal challenges by \nmultiple circuits wastes judicial resources and creates a \nsubstantial risk of inconsistent merits rulings.  Such \nrulings would produce a fragmented Good Neighbor \nprogram for ozone, subjecting similarly situated States \nto different regulatory burdens based on the circuits in \nwhich those States are located, and complicating EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of the \u201coverlapping and interwoven link-\nages between upwind and downwind States\u201d that char-\nacterize the ozone problem.  EPA v. EME Homer City \nGeneration, L. P., 572 U.S. 489, 496-497 (2014).  Such a \nresult is contrary to the principles animating the Good \nNeighbor Provision, and to Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose \nof ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of issues with \nnational significance.  If this Court endorses petition-\ners\u2019 venue analysis, future EPA actions similar to the \ndisapproval action here can be expected to spawn litiga-\ntion in numerous courts of appeals, with a consequent \nwaste of judicial resources and a heightened risk of in-\nconsistent outcomes.  Nothing in the statutory text re-\nquires that result, and the Court should reject it. \n \n \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe order of the court of appeals should be affirmed.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nJEANHEE HONG \nROSEMARY H.

The criteria for an air pollutant, to the ex-\ntent practicable, shall include information on\u2014 \n\n2a \n \n \n(A) \nthose variable factors (including atmos-\npheric conditions) which of themselves or in combina-\ntion with other factors may alter the effects on public \nhealth or welfare of such air pollutant; \n \n(B) \nthe types of air pollutants which, when pre-\nsent in the atmosphere, may interact with such pollu-\ntant to produce an adverse effect on public health or \nwelfare; and \n \n(C) \nany known or anticipated adverse effects on \nwelfare. \n(b) \nIssuance by Administrator of information on air pol-\nlution control techniques; standing consulting com-\nmittees for air pollutants; establishment; member-\nship \n(1) Simultaneously with the issuance of criteria un-\nder subsection (a), the Administrator shall, after consul-\ntation with appropriate advisory committees and Fed-\neral departments and agencies, issue to the States and \nappropriate air pollution control agencies information \non air pollution control techniques, which information \nshall include data relating to the cost of installation and \noperation, energy requirements, emission reduction \nbenefits, and environmental impact of the emission con-\ntrol technology.  Such information shall include such \ndata as are available on available technology and alter-\nnative methods of prevention and control of air pollu-\ntion.  Such information shall also include data on alter-\nnative fuels, processes, and operating methods which \nwill result in elimination or significant reduction of emis-\nsions. \n(2) In order to assist in the development of infor-\nmation on pollution control techniques, the Administra-\n\n3a \n \ntor may establish a standing consulting committee for \neach air pollutant included in a list published pursuant \nto subsection (a)(1), which shall be comprised of techni-\ncally qualified individuals representative of State and lo-\ncal governments, industry, and the academic commu-\nnity.  Each such committee shall submit, as appropri-\nate, to the Administrator information related to that re-\nquired by paragraph (1). \n(c) \nReview, modification, and reissuance of criteria or \ninformation \nThe Administrator shall from time to time review, \nand, as appropriate, modify, and reissue any criteria or \ninformation on control techniques issued pursuant to \nthis section.

L. 101-549, title I, \u00a7 101(d)(3)(B), \nNov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2409. \n(D) For purposes of this paragraph\u2014 \n \n(i) \nThe term \u201cparking surcharge regulation\u201d \nmeans a regulation imposing or requiring the impo-\nsition of any tax, surcharge, fee, or other charge on \nparking spaces, or any other area used for the tem-\nporary storage of motor vehicles. \n \n(ii) \nThe term \u201cmanagement of parking supply\u201d \nshall include any requirement providing that any new \nfacility containing a given number of parking spaces \nshall receive a permit or other prior approval, issu-\nance of which is to be conditioned on air quality con-\nsiderations. \n \n(iii) \nThe term \u201cpreferential bus/carpool lane\u201d \nshall include any requirement for the setting aside of \none or more lanes of a street or highway on a perma-\nnent or temporary basis for the exclusive use of buses \nor carpools, or both. \n(E) No standard, plan, or requirement, relating to \nmanagement of parking supply or preferential bus/ \ncarpool lanes shall be promulgated after June 22, 1974, \nby the Administrator pursuant to this section, unless \nsuch promulgation has been subjected to at least one \n\n22a \n \npublic hearing which has been held in the area affected \nand for which reasonable notice has been given in such \narea.  If substantial changes are made following public \nhearings, one or more additional hearings shall be held \nin such area after such notice. \n(3) Upon application of the chief executive officer of \nany general purpose unit of local government, if the Ad-\nministrator determines that such unit has adequate au-\nthority under State or local law, the Administrator may \ndelegate to such unit the authority to implement and en-\nforce within the jurisdiction of such unit any part of a \nplan promulgated under this subsection.  Nothing in \nthis paragraph shall prevent the Administrator from im-\nplementing or enforcing any applicable provision of a \nplan promulgated under this subsection. \n(4) Repealed. Pub.

If the President determines \nthat a national or regional energy emergency of such se-\nverity exists, a temporary emergency suspension of any \npart of an applicable implementation plan or of any re-\nquirement under section 7651j of this title (concerning \nexcess emissions penalties or offsets) adopted by the \nState may be issued by the Governor of any State cov-\nered by the President\u2019s determination under the condi-\ntion specified in paragraph (2) and may take effect im-\nmediately. \n(2) A temporary emergency suspension under this \nsubsection shall be issued to a source only if the Gover-\nnor of such State finds that\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthere exists in the vicinity of such source a \ntemporary energy emergency involving high levels of \nunemployment or loss of necessary energy supplies \nfor residential dwellings; and \n \n(B) \nsuch unemployment or loss can be totally or \npartially alleviated by such emergency suspension. \nNot more than one such suspension may be issued for \nany source on the basis of the same set of circumstances \nor on the basis of the same emergency. \n\n25a \n \n(3) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a \nGovernor under this subsection shall remain in effect for \na maximum of four months or such lesser period as may \nbe specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator, \nif any.  The Administrator may disapprove such sus-\npension if he determines that it does not meet the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2). \n(4) This subsection shall not apply in the case of a \nplan provision or requirement promulgated by the Ad-\nministrator under subsection (c) of this section, but in \nany such case the President may grant a temporary emer-\ngency suspension for a four month period of any such \nprovision or requirement if he makes the determinations \nand findings specified in paragraphs (1) and (2). \n(5) The Governor may include in any temporary \nemergency suspension issued under this subsection a \nprovision delaying for a period identical to the period of \nsuch suspension any compliance schedule (or increment \nof progress) to which such source is subject under sec-\ntion 1857c-102 of this title, as in effect before August 7, \n1977, or section 7413(d)2 of this title, upon a finding that \nsuch source is unable to comply with such schedule (or \nincrement) solely because of the conditions on the basis \nof which a suspension was issued under this subsection. \n(g) \nGovernor\u2019s authority to issue temporary emergency \nsuspensions \n(1) In the case of any State which has adopted and \nsubmitted to the Administrator a proposed plan revision \nwhich the State determines\u2014 \n \n(A) \nmeets the requirements of this section, and \n \n(B) \nis necessary (i) to prevent the closing for one \nyear or more of any source of air pollution, and (ii) to \n\n26a \n \nprevent substantial increases in unemployment which \nwould result from such closing, and \nwhich the Administrator has not approved or disap-\nproved under this section within 12 months of submis-\nsion of the proposed plan revision, the Governor may is-\nsue a temporary emergency suspension of the part of \nthe applicable implementation plan for such State which \nis proposed to be revised with respect to such source.  \nThe determination under subparagraph (B) may not be \nmade with respect to a source which would close without \nregard to whether or not the proposed plan revision is \napproved. \n(2) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a \nGovernor under this subsection shall remain in effect for \na maximum of four months or such lesser period as may \nbe specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator.  \nThe Administrator may disapprove such suspension if \nhe determines that it does not meet the requirements of \nthis subsection. \n(3) The Governor may include in any temporary \nemergency suspension issued under this subsection a \nprovision delaying for a period identical to the period of \nsuch suspension any compliance schedule (or increment \nof progress) to which such source is subject under sec-\ntion 1857c-1033of this title as in effect before August 7, \n1977, or under section 7413(d)3 of this title upon a find-\ning that such source is unable to comply with such sched-\nule (or increment) solely because of the conditions on the \nbasis of which a suspension was issued under this sub-\nsection. \n \n3  See References in Text note below. \n\n27a \n \n(h) Publication of comprehensive document for each \nState setting forth requirements of applicable im-\nplementation plan \n(1) Not later than 5 years after November 15, 1990, \nand every 3 years thereafter, the Administrator shall as-\nsemble and publish a comprehensive document for each \nState setting forth all requirements of the applicable im-\nplementation plan for such State and shall publish notice \nin the Federal Register of the availability of such docu-\nments. \n(2) The Administrator may promulgate such regula-\ntions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the \npurpose of this subsection. \n(i) \nModification of requirements prohibited \nExcept for a primary nonferrous smelter order un-\nder section 7419 of this title, a suspension under subsec-\ntion (f\u200a) or (g) (relating to emergency suspensions), an \nexemption under section 7418 of this title (relating to \ncertain Federal facilities), an order under section \n7413(d)3 of this title (relating to compliance orders), a \nplan promulgation under subsection (c), or a plan revi-\nsion under subsection (a)(3); no order, suspension, plan \nrevision, or other action modifying any requirement of \nan applicable implementation plan may be taken with re-\nspect to any stationary source by the State or by the Ad-\nministrator. \n(\u200aj) \nTechnological systems of continuous emission re-\nduction on new or modified stationary sources; com-\npliance with performance standards \nAs a condition for issuance of any permit required un-\nder this subchapter, the owner or operator of each new \nor modified stationary source which is required to obtain \n\n28a \n \nsuch a permit must show to the satisfaction of the per-\nmitting authority that the technological system of con-\ntinuous emission reduction which is to be used at such \nsource will enable it to comply with the standards of per-\nformance which are to apply to such source and that the \nconstruction or modification and operation of such \nsource will be in compliance with all other requirements \nof this chapter. \n(k) Environmental Protection Agency action on plan \nsubmissions \n(1) Completeness of plan submissions \n \n(A) \nCompleteness criteria \n \nWithin 9 months after November 15, 1990, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate minimum criteria \nthat any plan submission must meet before the \nAdministrator is required to act on such submis-\nsion under this subsection.  The criteria shall be \nlimited to the information necessary to enable the \nAdministrator to determine whether the plan sub-\nmission complies with the provisions of this chap-\nter. \n \n(B) \nCompleteness finding \n \nWithin 60 days of the Administrator\u2019s receipt \nof a plan or plan revision, but no later than 6 \nmonths after the date, if any, by which a State is \nrequired to submit the plan or revision, the Ad-\nministrator shall determine whether the minimum \ncriteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A) \nhave been met.  Any plan or plan revision that a \nState submits to the Administrator, and that has \nnot been determined by the Administrator (by the \ndate 6 months after receipt of the submission) to \n\n29a \n \nhave failed to meet the minimum criteria estab-\nlished pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall on that \ndate be deemed by operation of law to meet such \nminimum criteria. \n \n(C) \nEffect of finding of incompleteness \n \nWhere the Administrator determines that a \nplan submission (or part thereof\u200a) does not meet \nthe minimum criteria established pursuant to sub-\nparagraph (A), the State shall be treated as not \nhaving made the submission (or, in the Adminis-\ntrator\u2019s discretion, part thereof\u200a). \n(2) Deadline for action \n \nWithin 12 months of a determination by the Ad-\nministrator (or a determination deemed by operation \nof law) under paragraph (1) that a State has submit-\nted a plan or plan revision (or, in the Administrator\u2019s \ndiscretion, part thereof\u200a) that meets the minimum cri-\nteria established pursuant to paragraph (1), if appli-\ncable (or, if those criteria are not applicable, within \n12 months of submission of the plan or revision), the \nAdministrator shall act on the submission in accord-\nance with paragraph (3). \n(3) Full and partial approval and disapproval \n \nIn the case of any submittal on which the Admin-\nistrator is required to act under paragraph (2), the \nAdministrator shall approve such submittal as a \nwhole if it meets all of the applicable requirements of \nthis chapter.  If a portion of the plan revision meets \nall the applicable requirements of this chapter, the \nAdministrator may approve the plan revision in part \nand disapprove the plan revision in part.  The plan \nrevision shall not be treated as meeting the require-\n\n30a \n \nments of this chapter until the Administrator ap-\nproves the entire plan revision as complying with the \napplicable requirements of this chapter. \n(4) Conditional approval \n \nThe Administrator may approve a plan revision \nbased on a commitment of the State to adopt specific \nenforceable measures by a date certain, but not later \nthan 1 year after the date of approval of the plan re-\nvision.  Any such conditional approval shall be \ntreated as a disapproval if the State fails to comply \nwith such commitment. \n(5) Calls for plan revisions \n \nWhenever the Administrator finds that the appli-\ncable implementation plan for any area is substan-\ntially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant \nnational ambient air quality standard, to mitigate ad-\nequately the interstate pollutant transport described \nin section 7506a of this title or section 7511c of this \ntitle, or to otherwise comply with any requirement of \nthis chapter, the Administrator shall require the \nState to revise the plan as necessary to correct such \ninadequacies.  The Administrator shall notify the \nState of the inadequacies, and may establish reason-\nable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months after the date \nof such notice) for the submission of such plan revi-\nsions.  Such findings and notice shall be public.  \nAny finding under this paragraph shall, to the extent \nthe Administrator deems appropriate, subject the \nState to the requirements of this chapter to which the \nState was subject when it developed and submitted \nthe plan for which such finding was made, except that \nthe Administrator may adjust any dates applicable \n\n31a \n \nunder such requirements as appropriate (except that \nthe Administrator may not adjust any attainment \ndate prescribed under part D, unless such date has \nelapsed). \n(6) Corrections \n \nWhenever the Administrator determines that  \nthe Administrator\u2019s action approving, disapproving, \nor promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part \nthereof\u200a), area designation, redesignation, classifica-\ntion, or reclassification was in error, the Administra-\ntor may in the same manner as the approval, disap-\nproval, or promulgation revise such action as appro-\npriate without requiring any further submission from \nthe State.  Such determination and the basis thereof \nshall be provided to the State and public. \n(l) \nPlan revisions \nEach revision to an implementation plan submitted \nby a State under this chapter shall be adopted by such \nState after reasonable notice and public hearing.  The \nAdministrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if \nthe revision would interfere with any applicable require-\nment concerning attainment and reasonable further \nprogress (as defined in section 7501 of this title), or any \nother applicable requirement of this chapter. \n(m) Sanctions \nThe Administrator may apply any of the sanctions \nlisted in section 7509(b) of this title at any time (or at \nany time after) the Administrator makes a finding, dis-\napproval, or determination under paragraphs (1) through \n(4), respectively, of section 7509(a) of this title in rela-\ntion to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by \nthe Administrator) required under this chapter, with re-\n\n32a \n \nspect to any portion of the State the Administrator de-\ntermines reasonable and appropriate, for the purpose of \nensuring that the requirements of this chapter relating \nto such plan or plan item are met.  The Administrator \nshall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his au-\nthority under the previous sentence with respect to any \ndeficiency referred to in section 7509(a) of this title to \nensure that, during the 24-month period following the \nfinding, disapproval, or determination referred to \nin section 7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not ap-\nplied on a statewide basis where one or more political \nsubdivisions covered by the applicable implementation \nplan are principally responsible for such deficiency. \n(n) Savings clauses \n(1) Existing plan provisions \n \nAny provision of any applicable implementation \nplan that was approved or promulgated by the Ad-\nministrator pursuant to this section as in effect be-\nfore November 15, 1990, shall remain in effect as part \nof such applicable implementation plan, except to the \nextent that a revision to such provision is approved \nor promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to \nthis chapter. \n(2) Attainment dates \n \nFor any area not designated nonattainment, any \nplan or plan revision submitted or required to be sub-\nmitted by a State\u2014 \n \n(A) \nin response to the promulgation or revi-\nsion of a national primary ambient air quality \nstandard in effect on November 15, 1990, or \n\n33a \n \n \n(B) \nin response to a finding of substantial in-\nadequacy under subsection (a)(2) (as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990), \nshall provide for attainment of the national primary \nambient air quality standards within 3 years of No-\nvember 15, 1990, or within 5 years of issuance of such \nfinding of substantial inadequacy, whichever is later. \n(3) Retention of construction moratorium in certain \nareas \n \nIn the case of an area to which, immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990, the prohibition on construction \nor modification of major stationary sources prescribed \nin subsection (a)(2)(I) (as in effect immediately be-\nfore November 15, 1990) applied by virtue of a find-\ning of the Administrator that the State containing \nsuch area had not submitted an implementation plan \nmeeting the requirements of section 7502(b)(6) of \nthis title (relating to establishment of a permit pro-\ngram) (as in effect immediately before November 15, \n1990) or 7502(a)(1) of this title (to the extent such re-\nquirements relate to provision for attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990, no major sta-\ntionary source of the relevant air pollutant or pollu-\ntants shall be constructed or modified in such area \nuntil the Administrator finds that the plan for such \narea meets the applicable requirements of section \n7502(c)(5) of this title (relating to permit programs) \nor subpart 5 of part D (relating to attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur dioxide), respectively. \n\n34a \n \n(o) \nIndian tribes \nIf an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to \nthe Administrator pursuant to section 7601(d) of this ti-\ntle, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the \nprovisions for review set forth in this section for State \nplans, except as otherwise provided by regulation prom-\nulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this title.  \nWhen such plan becomes effective in accordance with \nthe regulations promulgated under section 7601(d) of \nthis title, the plan shall become applicable to all areas \n(except as expressly provided otherwise in the plan) lo-\ncated within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, \nnotwithstanding the issuance of any patent and includ-\ning rights-of-way running through the reservation. \n(p) \nReports \nAny State shall submit, according to such schedule as \nthe Administrator may prescribe, such reports as the \nAdministrator may require relating to emission reduc-\ntions, vehicle miles traveled, congestion levels, and any \nother information the Administrator may deem neces-\nsary to assess the development4 effectiveness, need for \nrevision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision \nrequired under this chapter. \n \n4. 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) provides: \nAdministrative proceedings and judicial review \n(b) \nJudicial review \n(1) A petition for review of action of the Administra-\ntor in promulgating any national primary or secondary \n \n4  So in original.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape continues to deepen with the introduction of amicus curiae briefs. The \"Brief of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as Amicus Curiae in Support of Neither Party\" provides a significant new dimension to the arguments, reinforcing the petitioners' position from a different and influential perspective.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, Reinforced):** My belief that the petitioners' case is grounded in a textualist reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is unchanged and strongly reinforced. The petitioners argue that the disapproval of a single state's plan is inherently a \"locally or regionally applicable\" action, and the statute's distinction between the \"action\" and the \"notice\" of the action means the EPA cannot change the venue by simply bundling disparate local actions into one Federal Register notice.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Stable):** My understanding of the EPA's two-pronged defense remains stable: (1) the rule is \"nationally applicable\" because it was a single, consolidated rulemaking applying a uniform methodology, and (2) alternatively, it is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit because it is \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\" (the four-step framework).\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable, Refined):** The core conflict\u2014whether the \"action\" is the individual disapproval or the consolidated rulemaking\u2014is now framed not just as a matter of federalism but also as a matter of administrative law principles. The key question is whether the Court should prioritize a substance-based view of jurisdiction (favoring petitioners) or defer to the agency's procedural packaging (favoring the EPA).\n\n4.  **Petitioners' Rebuttal (Stable, Reinforced):** My understanding of the petitioners' counter-arguments is stable and now supported by the Chamber of Commerce's brief. They argue that accepting the EPA's logic would render the \"locally or regionally applicable\" provision of the statute meaningless, as almost all EPA actions apply some form of national standard or framework. The core of the disapproval, they contend, was based on state-specific deficiencies, not the nationwide framework.\n\n5.  **Amicus Perspective - U.S. Chamber of Commerce (New Belief):** I have now incorporated the arguments from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Although officially neutral, the brief's substance strongly supports the petitioners' legal position by introducing a powerful new frame: the need for jurisdictional clarity and predictability.\n    *   **Argument for Predictability and Against \"Gamesmanship\":** The Chamber argues that all litigants, including the business community, benefit from \"clear and readily administrable rules governing the selection of venue.\" It contends that allowing venue to be determined by the EPA's choice to \"bundle\" actions into a single notice would create uncertainty, invite agency manipulation (\"gamesmanship\"), and lead to wasteful preliminary litigation, undermining the goal of efficient judicial review.\n    *   **Substance over Form:** The Chamber explicitly argues that the venue inquiry should focus on the *substance* of the EPA's action (i.e., the disapproval of a specific state's plan), not on \"formalistic or procedural distinctions\" like the method of publication.\n    *   **Preserving Statutory Structure (Anti-Surplusage Canon):** The Chamber's brief gives significant weight to the argument that the EPA's interpretation would violate the canon against surplusage. It argues that if applying a consistent legal framework is enough to trigger the \"nationwide scope or effect\" clause, it would \"deprive the second sentence of Section 307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect,\" effectively swallowing the default rule of regional review for the enumerated local actions.\n\nMy belief state has evolved significantly. I now see that the petitioners' arguments are not only supported by principles of federalism but also by influential voices from the business community advocating for clear, predictable jurisdictional rules that prevent agency overreach. The Chamber of Commerce's brief reframes the EPA's position as not just an expansive reading of its authority, but as one that would create an unstable and manipulable legal environment. This adds a potent, pragmatic argument against the EPA's position that is likely to resonate with Justices concerned with textualism, the separation of powers, and the practical consequences of judicial doctrines.",

This action, searching for amicus briefs in support of the respondents, is unlikely to introduce a fundamentally new legal question. However, its value lies in refinement and reinforcement. Amici may (1) introduce novel policy or historical arguments that the EPA did not emphasize, (2) signal which of the EPA's arguments are considered strongest by outside experts, and (3) provide arguments tailored to specific judicial philosophies, offering clues about how the case is being framed to persuade particular Justices. This will significantly refine my understanding of the relative weight and persuasiveness of the EPA's two main prongs, moving my belief state from a map of the arguments to a weighted map of their potential impact. Therefore, the Task EIG is moderate. The Design EIG is also solid, as it tests the general strategic value of analyzing respondent-side amici after the main brief is already understood, helping to refine my information-gathering process for future cases by determining if such briefs offer more than just repetition.",

It \nrepresents approximately 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than 3 mil-\nlion companies and professional organizations of every \nsize, in every industry sector, and from every region of \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto represent the interests of its members in matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nTo that end, the Chamber regularly files amicus curiae \nbriefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues of con-\ncern to the nation\u2019s business community. \nThe Chamber has an interest in maintaining effi-\ncient and predictable mechanisms for judicial review \nof federal agency action.  An important, frequently re-\ncurring, and oft-litigated threshold question in such \ncases is which court or courts are the proper venue for \nchallenges.  All stakeholders\u2014even those whose un-\nderlying interests in the merits of a dispute may be \ndiametrically opposed\u2014have a shared interest in hav-\ning clear and readily administrable rules governing \nthe selection of venue.  Unpredictable and unclear \nvenue rules can lead to wasteful and time-consuming \nthreshold litigation about whether venue is proper, in-\ncreasing the overall cost and uncertainty, and delay-\ning the ultimate resolution, of challenges to agency ac-\ntion. \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, or its counsel, made any monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nThe venue provisions in Section 307(b)(1) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), are significant \nin their own right, as they specify venue for judicial \nreview of a broad range of actions taken by the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air \nAct\u2014actions that, individually and in aggregate, can \nhave significant practical and economic consequences \nfor members of the nation\u2019s business community.  Un-\ncertainty and confusion about the meaning of these \nimportant provisions can have significant negative ef-\nfects\u2014as vividly illustrated by the circumstances and \nlengthy procedural history of the cases under review \nand other related litigation. \nThe Chamber files this brief as amicus curiae in \nsupport of neither party, taking no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases.  Instead, the \nChamber urges the Court to adopt an interpretation \nthat provides clarity and predictability to all stake-\nholders, and minimizes or avoids unnecessary and \nwasteful threshold litigation over the appropriate \nvenue for challenges brought under the Clean Air Act.  \nIn the Chamber\u2019s view, those interests would be best \nserved by an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that is \nfaithful to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory con-\nstruction. \nBy contrast, interests in clarity and predictability \nwould be disserved by a reading that allows the gov-\nernment to unilaterally select (or even manipulate) \nthe proper venue through its choice of formalities, \nsuch as whether to \u201cbundle\u201d together several individ-\nual actions into a single omnibus notice for purposes \nof publication in the Federal Register.  Similarly, \n\n3 \n \ninterests in clarity and predictability would be dis-\nserved by an interpretation that fails to give meaning \nand independent significance to each of the separate \nprovisions in Section 307(b)(1), which provide guid-\nance to litigants by drawing a line between cases that \ncan be brought only in the D.C. Circuit and cases for \nwhich venue lies exclusively in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  The Court should not endorse a reading \nthat would deprive any portion of Section 307(b)(1), in-\ncluding the second sentence addressing cases to be \nbought in the regional circuits, of meaningful inde-\npendent effect.  Such a reading would not comport \nwith the statutory text and would have adverse conse-\nquences for members of the nation\u2019s business commu-\nnity and for other litigants. \n INTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The nation\u2019s businesses, no less than other liti-\ngants, benefit from clarity and predictability in rules \nregarding where and when lawsuits can be brought, \nincluding rules regarding the selection of venue in \nchallenges to federal agency action.  Litigants avoid \nspending time and money litigating threshold issues \nwhen it is clear up front which court should adjudicate \na particular dispute.  Clarity in the articulation of \nvenue principles, in turn, promotes predictability in \ntheir application, enabling private parties to make in-\nformed business and investment decisions and other-\nwise order their affairs.  In short, certainty, transpar-\nency, and predictability regarding where certain types \nof claims will be litigated yield real-world benefits to \nlitigants and other stakeholders. \n\n4 \n \nBy contrast, complexity and uncertainty in the \nrules governing where a case may be brought consume \nvaluable resources as parties litigate the choice of the \nappropriate forum.  In the context of litigation chal-\nlenging federal agency actions, uncertainty regarding \nvenue rules can generate still further inefficiencies, \nsuch as the filing and consideration of protective peti-\ntions in multiple courts, when the law is unclear as to \nwhich court is appropriate, and the preparation and \nconsideration of merits briefs in cases that are ulti-\nmately dismissed for improper venue.  Meanwhile, \nresolution of merits issues is delayed, undermining \nCongress\u2019s decision to expedite challenges to certain \nfederal agency actions by (as here) authorizing direct \nappellate review.  Delay in resolving challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions in administering the Clean Air Act can \nharm all stakeholders, increasing transition and com-\npliance costs for regulated parties, and extending pe-\nriods of uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under \nreview. \nII. \nSection 307(b)(1) specifies that EPA\u2019s nation-\nally applicable actions will be reviewed in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit, while regionally or locally applicable actions will \nbe reviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, unless \nsuch an action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.  Although the Chamber takes no \nposition on the Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, and does not attempt to provide a universal tax-\nonomy of the cases that belong in the D.C. Circuit ver-\nsus regional circuits, this brief offers several interpre-\ntative points that would advance interests of clarity \nand predictability. \n\n5 \n \nFirst, a key textual distinction in Section 307(b)(1) \nis whether a given EPA action is \u201cnationally\u201d versus \n\u201clocally \nor \nregionally\u201d \napplicable. \n 42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  While hard cases for drawing that line \nmay exist, the inquiry should remain focused on the \nsubstance of the actions being taken by EPA, with \nclose attention to the statutory authority pursuant to \nwhich EPA has acted.  That approach follows from the \nstatutory text, which defines venue for different cate-\ngories of cases by cross-referencing substantive provi-\nsions of the Clean Air Act.  Where the substance of an \nEPA action is specific to a particular region or locality, \nthat action should be reviewed in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  Conversely, when the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action is nationally applicable, the case belongs \nin the D.C. Circuit. \nSecond, and relatedly, venue determinations \nshould not turn on formalistic or procedural distinc-\ntions that are disconnected from the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action.  Such an interpretation would open the \ndoor to manipulation, undermining interests in pre-\ndictability and certainty.  It would be improper, there-\nfore, to treat the analysis of venue under Section \n307(b)(1) as affected or even determined by whether \nEPA decides to bundle multiple individual actions into \na single notice for publication in the Federal Register, \nif in fact each individual action pertains to a specific \nlocation.  Allowing such bundling to affect the venue \nanalysis would increase uncertainty and inefficiency \nfor actions that, in substance, are fundamentally local \nor regional in nature.  And it would disserve interests \nin predictability, because regulated parties would \nhave no way of knowing in advance whether EPA \n\n6 \n \nwould combine multiple individual actions (each re-\ngional or local in character) into a single publication \npackage.   \nThird, meaningful effect should be given to each \nseparate part of the venue provisions in Section \n307(b)(1).  Congress took care to identify and distin-\nguish between classes of cases that are always subject \nto review in the D.C. Circuit (first sentence), and clas-\nses of cases that are presumptively subject to review \nin the regional circuits (second sentence).  And Con-\ngress provided a narrow exception to the second sen-\ntence for regional actions that are \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d (third sen-\ntence).  The third sentence should be interpreted in \nlight of that structure and not as a means for overrid-\ning the division in the previous two sentences. \nIII. Applying these principles to the issues before \nthe Court in these cases, a natural starting point is to \nrecognize that the EPA disapprovals of state imple-\nmentation plans challenged in these cases lie in the \nheartland of Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s list of orders reviewa-\nble in the regional circuit courts.  EPA has argued that \nit can effectively channel any case to the D.C. Circuit \nby packaging together multiple individual actions; \nthat argument, however, runs afoul of each of the prin-\nciples discussed above, that interpretation of the \nvenue provisions should focus on the statutory text \nand the substance of EPA\u2019s actions and should give \nmeaningful effect to each sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  \nEPA has also argued that an action is reviewable in \nthe D.C. Circuit under the third sentence of Section \n307(b)(1), so long as EPA identifies some underlying \n\u201clegal and technical determinations\u201d that apply across \n\n7 \n \nstates and that constitute even one among many of the \nbut-for causes of its action.  That argument would, \nhowever, deprive the second sentence of Section \n307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect, because \nit should almost always be the case that, in taking a \nparticular action, the agency acknowledges and ap-\nplies a consistent framework or understanding of its \nClean Air Act authority that contributes to its deci-\nsionmaking in a material respect.  More is required to \ntrigger the third sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  The \ngovernment\u2019s reading, if adopted here, would deprive \nlitigants of clarity and predictability.   \nHowever the Court resolves the specific issues \npresented here, it should strive to adopt a clear inter-\npretation of the venue provisions of Section 307(b)(1) \nthat gives effect to each of their components.   \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nMembers \nof \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nBusiness \nCommunity, Like All Litigants, Benefit from \nClear and Predictable Rules Regarding \nVenue.  \nThis Court favors, and litigants benefit from, \n\u201cclear boundaries\u201d and \u201cadministrative simplicity\u201d \nwhen it comes to the interpretation of statutes dictat-\ning where a case should be heard.  Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n \nv. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 11 (2015); Hertz Corp. v. Friend, \n559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010).  As courts and commentators \nhave long recognized, such \u201cclarity generally reduces \nlitigant costs,\u201d Scott Dodson, The Complexity of Juris-\ndictional Clarity, 97 Va. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2011), by reduc-\ning the need for \u201cadjudication that has little to do with \nthe merits,\u201d Barry Friedman, Under the Law of \n\n8 \n \nFederal Jurisdiction: Allocating Cases Between Fed-\neral and State Courts, 104 Colum. L. Rev. 1211, 1225 \n(2004). \nSimple rules \u201cpromote greater predictability,\u201d \nwhich also \u201cis valuable to corporations making busi-\nness and investment decisions,\u201d Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94, \nand \u201cfacilitate[s] efficient private bargaining in the \nshadow of the law,\u201d Jonathan Remy Nash, On the Ef-\nficient Deployment of Rules and Standards to Define \nFederal Jurisdiction, 65 Vand. L. Rev. 509, 522 (2012); \nsee also William Grayson Lambert, The Necessary \nNarrowing of General Personal Jurisdiction, 100 \nMarq. L. Rev. 375, 415 (2016) (clear and predictable \nrules \u201callow[] individuals and businesses to order their \naffairs and have rational expectations about where po-\ntential disputes could be resolved\u201d). \nOn the other hand, complex tests governing juris-\ndiction, venue, and other threshold questions \u201ccompli-\ncate a case, eating up time and money as the parties \nlitigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court \nis the right court to decide those claims.\u201d  Hertz, 559 \nU.S. at 94; see also Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. \n458, 464 n.13 (1980) (in discussing related question of \njurisdiction, emphasizing that \u201c[i]t is of first im-\nportance to have a definition * * * [that] will not invite \nextensive threshold litigation * * * over whether the \ncase is in the right court,\u201d which \u201cis essentially a waste \nof time and resources\u201d).  Complex and unclear rules \n\u201cproduce appeals and reversals, [and] encourage \ngamesmanship.\u201d  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94; see also Dod-\nson, supra, at 8 (\u201c[W]hen the court does resolve a ju-\nrisdictional issue under clear doctrine, that decision is \nlikely to be accurate, causing fewer appeals and fewer \n\n9 \n \nreversals.\u201d).  The resources spent litigating such ques-\ntions \u201ccould otherwise be used to expand business, cre-\nate jobs, and develop new products\u201d; in many contexts, \nthose costs may instead be \u201cpassed on to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices.\u201d  Lisa Litwiller, Why Amend-\nments to Rule 23 Are Not Enough: A Case for the Fed-\neralization of Class Actions, 7 Chap. L. Rev. 201, 202 \n(2004). \nIn cases such as this one involving challenges to \nfederal agency action, uncertainty over proper venue \ncan spawn unnecessary (and often fruitless) litigation \nin multiple respects.  For instance, although parties \nmay raise objections to venue in preliminary motions, \nappellate courts regularly carry venue questions with \nthe case, deferring their resolution to the merits panel.  \nSee, e.g., Order, Nev. Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDoc. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. \nEPA, No. 23-9509, Doc. No. 93 (10th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2023).  As a result, parties must devote considerable \ntime and resources to fully briefing the merits of a case \nthat may ultimately be transferred or dismissed for \nimproper venue, leading to duplication of effort and re-\nbriefing in the new forum.  E.g., Oklahoma v. EPA, 93 \nF.4th 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 2024).  And even where \nvenue is retained, the assigned court is forced to dedi-\ncate substantial energy to addressing venue issues.  \nSee Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2024 WL 5001991 \n(6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024) (devoting roughly 15 pages of \n41-page opinion to Section 307(b)(1) venue issue). \nAdditionally, to hedge against the risk that a pe-\ntition for review in one court might be dismissed on \nvenue grounds, parties often \u201cprotectively\u201d file cases in \nmultiple venues, leading to additional expenditures of \n\n10 \n \nresources by the courts and parties.  See, e.g., Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n2022) (noting that the petitioner had filed protective \npetition for review in Ninth Circuit, in case governed \nby Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act; holding that \nvenue was proper in Ninth Circuit); Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 926 F.3d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (similar).  This \nCourt encountered such a practice in National Associ-\nation of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, \nwhich addressed and resolved confusion over whether \na particular EPA decision fell within a statutorily enu-\nmerated list of actions that must be reviewed in fed-\neral courts of appeals, rather than district courts.  583 \nU.S. 109, 114 (2018).  Due to uncertainty regarding \nthis question, numerous parties had \u201cfile[d] \u2018protec-\ntive\u2019 petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals \nto preserve their challenges in the event that their Dis-\ntrict Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of juris-\ndiction.\u201d  Id. at 119.  Divergent jurisdictional decisions \nensued: one court of appeals exercised jurisdiction to \nstay EPA\u2019s rule, while a district court held that it had \njurisdiction to review the rule, and other district \ncourts dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Ibid. \nWhile parties and courts work to resolve confusion \nas to venue questions, the ultimate resolution of the \nunderlying merits is further delayed, with negative \npractical consequences for regulators, regulated enti-\nties, and other stakeholders.  For example, in the \nFourth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit litigation involv-\ning EPA\u2019s disapprovals of West Virginia\u2019s and Ala-\nbama\u2019s plans to address \u201cgood neighbor\u201d obligations \narising out of the most recent ozone air quality stand-\nards, the courts have postponed deciding the cases on \n\n11 \n \nthe merits pending this Court\u2019s resolution of the venue \nquestion.  Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11196, Doc. \nNo. 56 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2024); Order, West Virginia \nv. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. No. 126 (4th Cir. Oct. 21, \n2024).  In parallel cases in the Fifth and Eighth Cir-\ncuits, the courts likewise have not yet disposed of pe-\ntitions for review on the merits, despite having acted \non stay motions for those disapprovals more than 18 \nmonths ago.  See Order, Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-\n1320, Doc. No. 5280996 (8th Cir. May 25, 2023); Texas \nv. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 (5th Cir. May \n1, 2023). \nAll of these inefficiencies add up to very real costs \nfor litigants and the courts.  The resultant delays are \nhard to square with Congress\u2019s intention to expedite \nresolution of the challenges by allowing direct review \nin the courts of appeals.  See Virginia v. United States, \n74 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 1996) (direct appellate re-\nview creates a streamlined process for \u201cprompt and \nconclusive\u201d judicial review of agency actions); accord \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985) (direct appellate review of agency decisions \navoids \u201cduplication of the identical task in the district \ncourt and in the court of appeals\u201d).  And regulated par-\nties will incur higher transition and compliance costs, \nand all stakeholders will experience extended periods \nof uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under re-\nview. \nThese negative consequences can be mitigated, \nand clarity and predictability improved, by adopting \nan interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue rules \nthat adheres faithfully to the statutory text.  See An-\ntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \n\n12 \n \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, at xxix (2012) (interpre-\ntive approach grounded in the text will typically \u201cpro-\nvide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater \npredictability\u201d).  That precept is especially true with \nrespect to the interpretation of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhere Congress crafted a reticulated and balanced \nstatutory scheme that channels certain kinds of cases \nto the D.C. Circuit and others to the appropriate re-\ngional circuits. \nII. \nThis \nCourt \nShould \nInterpret \nSection \n307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act in a Manner \nthat \nProvides \nClear, \nPredictable, \nand \nAdministrable Principles for Determining \nVenue. \nSection 307(b)(1) provides a three-part structure \nfor determining which court of appeals must hear a pe-\ntition for review of a final action by EPA: \n\u2022 The first sentence of Section 307(b)(1) states \nthat a petition for review of any of an enumer-\nated list of EPA actions, \u201cor any other nation-\nally applicable regulations promulgated, or fi-\nnal action taken, by [EPA] under this chapter[,] \nmay be filed only in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. \n\u2022 The second sentence provides that a petition for \nreview of any of another enumerated list of EPA \nactions \u201cor any other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable may be filed \nonly in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \u201cfor the ap-\npropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u2022 The third sentence creates a limited exception \nto the second, stating that an action referenced \n\n13 \n \nin the second sentence is reviewable only in the \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It \nrepresents approximately 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than 3 mil-\nlion companies and professional organizations of every \nsize, in every industry sector, and from every region of \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto represent the interests of its members in matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nTo that end, the Chamber regularly files amicus curiae \nbriefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues of con-\ncern to the nation\u2019s business community. \nThe Chamber has an interest in maintaining effi-\ncient and predictable mechanisms for judicial review \nof federal agency action.  An important, frequently re-\ncurring, and oft-litigated threshold question in such \ncases is which court or courts are the proper venue for \nchallenges.  All stakeholders\u2014even those whose un-\nderlying interests in the merits of a dispute may be \ndiametrically opposed\u2014have a shared interest in hav-\ning clear and readily administrable rules governing \nthe selection of venue.  Unpredictable and unclear \nvenue rules can lead to wasteful and time-consuming \nthreshold litigation about whether venue is proper, in-\ncreasing the overall cost and uncertainty, and delay-\ning the ultimate resolution, of challenges to agency ac-\ntion. \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, or its counsel, made any monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nThe venue provisions in Section 307(b)(1) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), are significant \nin their own right, as they specify venue for judicial \nreview of a broad range of actions taken by the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air \nAct\u2014actions that, individually and in aggregate, can \nhave significant practical and economic consequences \nfor members of the nation\u2019s business community.  Un-\ncertainty and confusion about the meaning of these \nimportant provisions can have significant negative ef-\nfects\u2014as vividly illustrated by the circumstances and \nlengthy procedural history of the cases under review \nand other related litigation. \nThe Chamber files this brief as amicus curiae in \nsupport of neither party, taking no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases.  Instead, the \nChamber urges the Court to adopt an interpretation \nthat provides clarity and predictability to all stake-\nholders, and minimizes or avoids unnecessary and \nwasteful threshold litigation over the appropriate \nvenue for challenges brought under the Clean Air Act.  \nIn the Chamber\u2019s view, those interests would be best \nserved by an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that is \nfaithful to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory con-\nstruction. \nBy contrast, interests in clarity and predictability \nwould be disserved by a reading that allows the gov-\nernment to unilaterally select (or even manipulate) \nthe proper venue through its choice of formalities, \nsuch as whether to \u201cbundle\u201d together several individ-\nual actions into a single omnibus notice for purposes \nof publication in the Federal Register.  Similarly, \n\n3 \n \ninterests in clarity and predictability would be dis-\nserved by an interpretation that fails to give meaning \nand independent significance to each of the separate \nprovisions in Section 307(b)(1), which provide guid-\nance to litigants by drawing a line between cases that \ncan be brought only in the D.C. Circuit and cases for \nwhich venue lies exclusively in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  The Court should not endorse a reading \nthat would deprive any portion of Section 307(b)(1), in-\ncluding the second sentence addressing cases to be \nbought in the regional circuits, of meaningful inde-\npendent effect.  Such a reading would not comport \nwith the statutory text and would have adverse conse-\nquences for members of the nation\u2019s business commu-\nnity and for other litigants. \n INTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The nation\u2019s businesses, no less than other liti-\ngants, benefit from clarity and predictability in rules \nregarding where and when lawsuits can be brought, \nincluding rules regarding the selection of venue in \nchallenges to federal agency action.  Litigants avoid \nspending time and money litigating threshold issues \nwhen it is clear up front which court should adjudicate \na particular dispute.  Clarity in the articulation of \nvenue principles, in turn, promotes predictability in \ntheir application, enabling private parties to make in-\nformed business and investment decisions and other-\nwise order their affairs.  In short, certainty, transpar-\nency, and predictability regarding where certain types \nof claims will be litigated yield real-world benefits to \nlitigants and other stakeholders. \n\n4 \n \nBy contrast, complexity and uncertainty in the \nrules governing where a case may be brought consume \nvaluable resources as parties litigate the choice of the \nappropriate forum.  In the context of litigation chal-\nlenging federal agency actions, uncertainty regarding \nvenue rules can generate still further inefficiencies, \nsuch as the filing and consideration of protective peti-\ntions in multiple courts, when the law is unclear as to \nwhich court is appropriate, and the preparation and \nconsideration of merits briefs in cases that are ulti-\nmately dismissed for improper venue.  Meanwhile, \nresolution of merits issues is delayed, undermining \nCongress\u2019s decision to expedite challenges to certain \nfederal agency actions by (as here) authorizing direct \nappellate review.  Delay in resolving challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions in administering the Clean Air Act can \nharm all stakeholders, increasing transition and com-\npliance costs for regulated parties, and extending pe-\nriods of uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under \nreview. \nII. \nSection 307(b)(1) specifies that EPA\u2019s nation-\nally applicable actions will be reviewed in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit, while regionally or locally applicable actions will \nbe reviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, unless \nsuch an action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.  Although the Chamber takes no \nposition on the Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, and does not attempt to provide a universal tax-\nonomy of the cases that belong in the D.C. Circuit ver-\nsus regional circuits, this brief offers several interpre-\ntative points that would advance interests of clarity \nand predictability. \n\n5 \n \nFirst, a key textual distinction in Section 307(b)(1) \nis whether a given EPA action is \u201cnationally\u201d versus \n\u201clocally \nor \nregionally\u201d \napplicable. \n 42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  While hard cases for drawing that line \nmay exist, the inquiry should remain focused on the \nsubstance of the actions being taken by EPA, with \nclose attention to the statutory authority pursuant to \nwhich EPA has acted.  That approach follows from the \nstatutory text, which defines venue for different cate-\ngories of cases by cross-referencing substantive provi-\nsions of the Clean Air Act.  Where the substance of an \nEPA action is specific to a particular region or locality, \nthat action should be reviewed in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  Conversely, when the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action is nationally applicable, the case belongs \nin the D.C. Circuit. \nSecond, and relatedly, venue determinations \nshould not turn on formalistic or procedural distinc-\ntions that are disconnected from the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action.  Such an interpretation would open the \ndoor to manipulation, undermining interests in pre-\ndictability and certainty.  It would be improper, there-\nfore, to treat the analysis of venue under Section \n307(b)(1) as affected or even determined by whether \nEPA decides to bundle multiple individual actions into \na single notice for publication in the Federal Register, \nif in fact each individual action pertains to a specific \nlocation.  Allowing such bundling to affect the venue \nanalysis would increase uncertainty and inefficiency \nfor actions that, in substance, are fundamentally local \nor regional in nature.  And it would disserve interests \nin predictability, because regulated parties would \nhave no way of knowing in advance whether EPA \n\n6 \n \nwould combine multiple individual actions (each re-\ngional or local in character) into a single publication \npackage.   \nThird, meaningful effect should be given to each \nseparate part of the venue provisions in Section \n307(b)(1).  Congress took care to identify and distin-\nguish between classes of cases that are always subject \nto review in the D.C. Circuit (first sentence), and clas-\nses of cases that are presumptively subject to review \nin the regional circuits (second sentence).  And Con-\ngress provided a narrow exception to the second sen-\ntence for regional actions that are \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d (third sen-\ntence).  The third sentence should be interpreted in \nlight of that structure and not as a means for overrid-\ning the division in the previous two sentences. \nIII. Applying these principles to the issues before \nthe Court in these cases, a natural starting point is to \nrecognize that the EPA disapprovals of state imple-\nmentation plans challenged in these cases lie in the \nheartland of Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s list of orders reviewa-\nble in the regional circuit courts.  EPA has argued that \nit can effectively channel any case to the D.C. Circuit \nby packaging together multiple individual actions; \nthat argument, however, runs afoul of each of the prin-\nciples discussed above, that interpretation of the \nvenue provisions should focus on the statutory text \nand the substance of EPA\u2019s actions and should give \nmeaningful effect to each sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  \nEPA has also argued that an action is reviewable in \nthe D.C. Circuit under the third sentence of Section \n307(b)(1), so long as EPA identifies some underlying \n\u201clegal and technical determinations\u201d that apply across \n\n7 \n \nstates and that constitute even one among many of the \nbut-for causes of its action.  That argument would, \nhowever, deprive the second sentence of Section \n307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect, because \nit should almost always be the case that, in taking a \nparticular action, the agency acknowledges and ap-\nplies a consistent framework or understanding of its \nClean Air Act authority that contributes to its deci-\nsionmaking in a material respect.  More is required to \ntrigger the third sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  The \ngovernment\u2019s reading, if adopted here, would deprive \nlitigants of clarity and predictability.   \nHowever the Court resolves the specific issues \npresented here, it should strive to adopt a clear inter-\npretation of the venue provisions of Section 307(b)(1) \nthat gives effect to each of their components.   \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nMembers \nof \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nBusiness \nCommunity, Like All Litigants, Benefit from \nClear and Predictable Rules Regarding \nVenue.  \nThis Court favors, and litigants benefit from, \n\u201cclear boundaries\u201d and \u201cadministrative simplicity\u201d \nwhen it comes to the interpretation of statutes dictat-\ning where a case should be heard.  Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n \nv. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 11 (2015); Hertz Corp. v. Friend, \n559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010).  As courts and commentators \nhave long recognized, such \u201cclarity generally reduces \nlitigant costs,\u201d Scott Dodson, The Complexity of Juris-\ndictional Clarity, 97 Va. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2011), by reduc-\ning the need for \u201cadjudication that has little to do with \nthe merits,\u201d Barry Friedman, Under the Law of \n\n8 \n \nFederal Jurisdiction: Allocating Cases Between Fed-\neral and State Courts, 104 Colum. L. Rev. 1211, 1225 \n(2004). \nSimple rules \u201cpromote greater predictability,\u201d \nwhich also \u201cis valuable to corporations making busi-\nness and investment decisions,\u201d Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94, \nand \u201cfacilitate[s] efficient private bargaining in the \nshadow of the law,\u201d Jonathan Remy Nash, On the Ef-\nficient Deployment of Rules and Standards to Define \nFederal Jurisdiction, 65 Vand. L. Rev. 509, 522 (2012); \nsee also William Grayson Lambert, The Necessary \nNarrowing of General Personal Jurisdiction, 100 \nMarq. L. Rev. 375, 415 (2016) (clear and predictable \nrules \u201callow[] individuals and businesses to order their \naffairs and have rational expectations about where po-\ntential disputes could be resolved\u201d). \nOn the other hand, complex tests governing juris-\ndiction, venue, and other threshold questions \u201ccompli-\ncate a case, eating up time and money as the parties \nlitigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court \nis the right court to decide those claims.\u201d  Hertz, 559 \nU.S. at 94; see also Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. \n458, 464 n.13 (1980) (in discussing related question of \njurisdiction, emphasizing that \u201c[i]t is of first im-\nportance to have a definition * * * [that] will not invite \nextensive threshold litigation * * * over whether the \ncase is in the right court,\u201d which \u201cis essentially a waste \nof time and resources\u201d).  Complex and unclear rules \n\u201cproduce appeals and reversals, [and] encourage \ngamesmanship.\u201d  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94; see also Dod-\nson, supra, at 8 (\u201c[W]hen the court does resolve a ju-\nrisdictional issue under clear doctrine, that decision is \nlikely to be accurate, causing fewer appeals and fewer \n\n9 \n \nreversals.\u201d).  The resources spent litigating such ques-\ntions \u201ccould otherwise be used to expand business, cre-\nate jobs, and develop new products\u201d; in many contexts, \nthose costs may instead be \u201cpassed on to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices.\u201d  Lisa Litwiller, Why Amend-\nments to Rule 23 Are Not Enough: A Case for the Fed-\neralization of Class Actions, 7 Chap. L. Rev. 201, 202 \n(2004). \nIn cases such as this one involving challenges to \nfederal agency action, uncertainty over proper venue \ncan spawn unnecessary (and often fruitless) litigation \nin multiple respects.  For instance, although parties \nmay raise objections to venue in preliminary motions, \nappellate courts regularly carry venue questions with \nthe case, deferring their resolution to the merits panel.  \nSee, e.g., Order, Nev. Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDoc. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. \nEPA, No. 23-9509, Doc. No. 93 (10th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2023).  As a result, parties must devote considerable \ntime and resources to fully briefing the merits of a case \nthat may ultimately be transferred or dismissed for \nimproper venue, leading to duplication of effort and re-\nbriefing in the new forum.  E.g., Oklahoma v. EPA, 93 \nF.4th 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 2024).  And even where \nvenue is retained, the assigned court is forced to dedi-\ncate substantial energy to addressing venue issues.  \nSee Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2024 WL 5001991 \n(6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024) (devoting roughly 15 pages of \n41-page opinion to Section 307(b)(1) venue issue). \nAdditionally, to hedge against the risk that a pe-\ntition for review in one court might be dismissed on \nvenue grounds, parties often \u201cprotectively\u201d file cases in \nmultiple venues, leading to additional expenditures of \n\n10 \n \nresources by the courts and parties.  See, e.g., Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n2022) (noting that the petitioner had filed protective \npetition for review in Ninth Circuit, in case governed \nby Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act; holding that \nvenue was proper in Ninth Circuit); Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 926 F.3d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (similar).  This \nCourt encountered such a practice in National Associ-\nation of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, \nwhich addressed and resolved confusion over whether \na particular EPA decision fell within a statutorily enu-\nmerated list of actions that must be reviewed in fed-\neral courts of appeals, rather than district courts.  583 \nU.S. 109, 114 (2018).  Due to uncertainty regarding \nthis question, numerous parties had \u201cfile[d] \u2018protec-\ntive\u2019 petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals \nto preserve their challenges in the event that their Dis-\ntrict Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of juris-\ndiction.\u201d  Id. at 119.  Divergent jurisdictional decisions \nensued: one court of appeals exercised jurisdiction to \nstay EPA\u2019s rule, while a district court held that it had \njurisdiction to review the rule, and other district \ncourts dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Ibid. \nWhile parties and courts work to resolve confusion \nas to venue questions, the ultimate resolution of the \nunderlying merits is further delayed, with negative \npractical consequences for regulators, regulated enti-\nties, and other stakeholders.  For example, in the \nFourth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit litigation involv-\ning EPA\u2019s disapprovals of West Virginia\u2019s and Ala-\nbama\u2019s plans to address \u201cgood neighbor\u201d obligations \narising out of the most recent ozone air quality stand-\nards, the courts have postponed deciding the cases on \n\n11 \n \nthe merits pending this Court\u2019s resolution of the venue \nquestion.  Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11196, Doc. \nNo. 56 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2024); Order, West Virginia \nv. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. No. 126 (4th Cir. Oct. 21, \n2024).  In parallel cases in the Fifth and Eighth Cir-\ncuits, the courts likewise have not yet disposed of pe-\ntitions for review on the merits, despite having acted \non stay motions for those disapprovals more than 18 \nmonths ago.  See Order, Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-\n1320, Doc. No. 5280996 (8th Cir. May 25, 2023); Texas \nv. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 (5th Cir. May \n1, 2023). \nAll of these inefficiencies add up to very real costs \nfor litigants and the courts.  The resultant delays are \nhard to square with Congress\u2019s intention to expedite \nresolution of the challenges by allowing direct review \nin the courts of appeals.  See Virginia v. United States, \n74 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 1996) (direct appellate re-\nview creates a streamlined process for \u201cprompt and \nconclusive\u201d judicial review of agency actions); accord \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985) (direct appellate review of agency decisions \navoids \u201cduplication of the identical task in the district \ncourt and in the court of appeals\u201d).  And regulated par-\nties will incur higher transition and compliance costs, \nand all stakeholders will experience extended periods \nof uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under re-\nview. \nThese negative consequences can be mitigated, \nand clarity and predictability improved, by adopting \nan interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue rules \nthat adheres faithfully to the statutory text.  See An-\ntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \n\n12 \n \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, at xxix (2012) (interpre-\ntive approach grounded in the text will typically \u201cpro-\nvide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater \npredictability\u201d).  That precept is especially true with \nrespect to the interpretation of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhere Congress crafted a reticulated and balanced \nstatutory scheme that channels certain kinds of cases \nto the D.C. Circuit and others to the appropriate re-\ngional circuits. \nII. \nThis \nCourt \nShould \nInterpret \nSection \n307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act in a Manner \nthat \nProvides \nClear, \nPredictable, \nand \nAdministrable Principles for Determining \nVenue. \nSection 307(b)(1) provides a three-part structure \nfor determining which court of appeals must hear a pe-\ntition for review of a final action by EPA: \n\u2022 The first sentence of Section 307(b)(1) states \nthat a petition for review of any of an enumer-\nated list of EPA actions, \u201cor any other nation-\nally applicable regulations promulgated, or fi-\nnal action taken, by [EPA] under this chapter[,] \nmay be filed only in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. \n\u2022 The second sentence provides that a petition for \nreview of any of another enumerated list of EPA \nactions \u201cor any other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable may be filed \nonly in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \u201cfor the ap-\npropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u2022 The third sentence creates a limited exception \nto the second, stating that an action referenced \n\n13 \n \nin the second sentence is reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit \u201cif such action is based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect \nand if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added).   \nThree principles from this text provide a helpful \nguide for understanding its application in cases like \nthese.   \n1.  First, decisions about whether a particular \nEPA action is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable,\u201d or \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d should be grounded in the \nsubstance of the relevant actions EPA is taking.  This \ninterpretation aligns with, and follows from, the de-\ntailed statutory enumerations of actions reviewable in \nparticular circuits that Congress included here.   \nThe references to specific categories of agency ac-\ntions in Section 307(b)(1) focus on the substantive na-\nture of, and legal authority underlying, those actions, \nas indicated by the extensive statutory cross-refer-\nences to other substantive provisions of the Clean Air \nAct authorizing EPA to act.  For example, the actions \nthat are to be reviewed exclusively by the D.C. Circuit \ninclude those that promulgate \u201cany national * * * am-\nbient air quality standard [NAAQS],\u201d \u201cany emission \nstandard\u201d for hazardous air pollutants under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412, and \u201cany standard of performance\u201d for \nstationary sources of pollutants under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7411.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  Actions presump-\ntively reviewable in the appropriate regional circuit, \n\n14 \n \nby contrast, include \u201capproving or promulgating any \n[state] implementation plan\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410, \nany order granting a waiver of performance require-\nments for a specific emissions source (\u201cwith the con-\nsent of the Governor of the State in which the source \nis to be located\u201d) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(j), and any \norder imposing a noncompliance penalty for a specific \nemissions source under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7420.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Court can thus infer that, where the statute \nsubsequently refers to \u201cany other nationally applicable \n* * * final action,\u201d \u201cany other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \u201ca determination \nof nationwide scope or effect,\u201d Congress was likewise \nconcerned with whether the substance of the agency\u2019s \naction has national, local, or regional applicability, or \nwhether the substance of the underlying determina-\ntion has nationwide scope or effect.  See Bissonnette v. \nLePage Bakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 \n(2024) (Under the ejusdem generis canon, \u201ccourts in-\nterpret a general or collective term at the end of a list \nof specific items in light of any common attribute[s] \nshared by the specific items.\u201d) (quotation marks omit-\nted).  Under this textual and interpretative approach, \nthe appropriate regional circuit should review an EPA \naction that makes determinations specific to a partic-\nular locality or region. \n2.  Second, and relatedly, venue selection should \nnot turn on purely formalistic distinctions or factors \nthat are otherwise disconnected from the substance of \nthe agency action in question, such as EPA\u2019s decision \n(or not) to \u201cbundle\u201d individual actions together for pur-\nposes of publication in the Federal Register.  The \n\n15 \n \nenumeration of EPA actions in Section 307(b)(1), as \ndiscussed above, looks to the underlying substantive \nauthority being exercised, not the form in which the \nagency chooses to publish one or more of its actions.  \nIndeed, if Congress had wanted to peg reviewability to \nthe form in which EPA published its actions, it could \neasily have done so.  Instead, Congress gave EPA care-\nfully limited discretion, via the third sentence of Sec-\ntion 307(b)(1), to choose whether to publish a finding \nthat its local or regional action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect.  This Court should \nnot adopt an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that \nwould vest EPA with the much broader discretion to \nchannel virtually any case to the D.C. Circuit by re-\ndefining the nature of the action via an atextual \u201cbun-\ndling\u201d theory. \nBy tying review to the substance of EPA\u2019s action, \nCongress also avoided opening the venue question to \nthe sort of manipulation that this Court has sought to \ndiscourage.  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94.  And it promoted \npredictability and certainty for regulated parties, who \ncommonly undertake a great deal of decisionmaking \nand preparatory work in advance of an EPA order\u2014\nwhether in seeking authorizations, investing in future \ncompliance, or in making other strategic business \njudgments\u2014some of which may be affected by the ex-\npected venue in which a petition for review of the \nagency\u2019s action may be heard.  See Hertz, 559 U.S. at \n94; Nash, supra, at 522; Lambert, supra, at 415.  If the \nform in which EPA chooses to publish an agency action \nprevails over the substance of the action in determin-\ning venue, the resulting uncertainty would hamper \n\n16 \n \nregulated parties\u2019 ability to engage in informed deci-\nsionmaking. \nIndeed, if discretionary, formalistic characteris-\ntics like the \u201cbundling\u201d of actions for publication were \ndispositive under Section 307(b)(1), confusion as to the \nproper venue could linger even after EPA issues a no-\ntice combining various regionally applicable actions.  \nAssuming for the sake of argument that an EPA action \nbecomes \u201cnational\u201d in character merely because it has \nbeen published together with numerous other actions \nthat, collectively, cover different areas of the country, \n\u201c[w]ould this logic reach an action that covered only \nCalifornia, Maine, and Alabama because they fall in \ndifferent parts of the country?  If not, how many more \nStates are needed?\u201d  Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at \n*8.   \nChanneling cases to the D.C. Circuit for reasons \nof form rather than substance would pose particular \nproblems whenever the agency concurrently issues a \nlarge number of actions that are each locally focused \nand fact-intensive.  The administrative record for any \nindividual agency action can consist of many hundreds \nor thousands of pages.  But where EPA\u2019s decision in \nreality consists of a series of distinct actions, each rest-\ning on individualized, fact-bound analysis focused on a \nparticular state or region, the aggregation of all those \nactions into a single review proceeding before a single \ncourt could easily result in an excessively large record \nand a need for briefs covering a panoply of complex is-\nsues specific to each of EPA\u2019s actions.  Forcing such \ncases to the D.C. Circuit could place significant strain \non judicial resources, as well as deprive the parties of \na full opportunity to argue the complex, locality-\n\n17 \n \nspecific issues that would be more fully vetted in a pro-\nceeding in a regional circuit devoted to those issues \nalone\u2014as Congress intended.  \n3.  Third, meaningful effect must be given  to each \nof the separate provisions in Section 307(b)(1)\u2014in-\ncluding the first, second, and third sentences.  After \nall, it is a \u201ccardinal principle of interpretation that \ncourts must give effect, if possible, to every clause and \nword of a statute.\u201d  Liu v. SEC, 591 U.S. 71, 89 (2020).  \nIn applying ordinary principles of statutory construc-\ntion, this Court has long avoided interpretations that \nwould treat any aspect of Congress\u2019s scheme as \u201cmean-\ningless\u201d or having \u201cno consequence.\u201d  Ibid.; Nielsen v. \nPreap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 (2019). \nHere, Congress divided responsibility for review of \nEPA\u2019s decisions under this scheme between the D.C. \nCircuit and the regional circuits.  This Court should \nadopt a reading that respects the balance that Con-\ngress struck, and does not deprive one provision of the \nstatute of meaningful effect (e.g., the part enumerat-\ning cases to be heard \u201conly\u201d in the regional circuits) \nthrough an overbroad interpretation of another provi-\nsion (e.g., the part ensuring that certain actions based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect are \nreviewed \u201conly\u201d in the D.C. Circuit).  The balance \nstruck by Congress accounts for a variety of consider-\nations.  For example, Congress presumably knew that \nregional circuit courts are most likely to be familiar \nwith and well-informed regarding legal and factual is-\nsues that affect local and regional interests.  These can \ninclude principles of state law that often arise in coop-\nerative federalism regimes such as the Clean Air Act, \nand the mix of legal, economic, social, and other \n\n18 \n \npractical considerations affecting major regulatory ac-\ntions.  See State Br. 54-55; cf. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d \n405, 424 (5th Cir. 2016) (asserting venue over chal-\nlenges to EPA\u2019s disapproval of Texas\u2019s and Oklahoma\u2019s \nplans for implementing air visibility standards); Texas \nv. EPA, 706 F. App\u2019x 159 (5th Cir. 2017) (same, for \nEPA\u2019s designation of three areas in Texas as not at-\ntaining revised air quality standards for sulfur diox-\nide).  And channeling regionally focused EPA actions \nto the regional circuits avoids disconnecting litigation \nfrom the areas where the effects of the agency\u2019s action \nare most acutely and directly felt.  So too does siting \ncases in the regional circuits avoid burdening litigants \nwith the higher travel and logistical costs associated \nwith litigating challenges in D.C.  And it avoids poten-\ntial optical concerns that an agency may enjoy a \n\u201chometown advantage\u201d in defending its decisions in \nWashington, D.C. \nBy contrast, siting review of truly nationally ap-\nplicable regulations, and certain determinations of na-\ntionwide scope or effect, in the D.C. Circuit avoids the \nprospect of conflicting decisions from multiple circuits \nover the same agency actions.  Multiple petitions filed \nin the D.C. Circuit can simply be consolidated, allow-\ning for more efficient review for all\u2014the government, \nprivate litigants, and the courts. \nIn sum, Congress contemplated that both the D.C. \nCircuit and regional circuits would have a meaningful \nrole.  This is not a statute, like some, that centralizes \n\n19 \n \nall review in the D.C. Circuit,2 or that vests regional \ncircuits with exclusive and irrebuttable jurisdiction \nover an entire category of cases.3  None of the sen-\ntences in Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s venue provisions should \nbe interpreted to undermine Congress\u2019s choices in as-\nsigning venue for judicial review of different kinds of \nEPA actions. \nIII. As Applied in These Cases, These Principles \nSupport Adopting an Interpretation that \nGives Real and Substantial Effect to Each \nPart of Section 307(b)(1). \nAlthough the Chamber takes no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases, the princi-\nples articulated above should provide helpful guidance \nin resolving the specific venue questions presented \nhere.  These cases concern EPA\u2019s disapproval of Utah\u2019s \nand Oklahoma\u2019s state plans for implementing EPA\u2019s \nozone standards under the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cGood \nNeighbor Provision.\u201d  State Pet. 1; see 88 Fed. Reg. \n9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  The cases thus involve EPA ac-\ntions that lie in the heartland of the list of actions enu-\nmerated in the second sentence of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhich include those actions that \u201capprov[e] or promul-\ngat[e] any implementation plan\u201d for EPA\u2019s air quality \nstandards, as well as any locally or regionally applica-\nble \u201cdenial or disapproval\u201d of such a plan.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1);  accord Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023) \n \n2 Cf., e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(a)(1) (Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(a) (Comprehensive Environmen-\ntal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). \n3 Cf. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1) (Natural Gas Act). \n\n20 \n \n(\u201cJust as most * * * approvals of SIPs * * * unequivo-\ncally fall in the \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 cate-\ngory, so too does the disapproval of SIPs.\u201d) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); see also Chevron, 45 \nF.4th at 386 (\u201cApproving or promulgating a State Im-\nplementation Plan is the prototypical \u2018locally or re-\ngionally applicable\u2019 action that may be challenged only \nin the appropriate regional court of appeals.\u201d) (cleaned \nup).  The statute thus appears to create a presumption \nthat actions of the kind at issue here should be re-\nviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, rather than \nthe D.C. Circuit. \nIn resisting that conclusion, the government has \nargued that its disapprovals were \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d implicating the first sentence of Section 307(b)(1), \nbecause EPA published one document combining the \ndisapprovals of various state implementation plans, \nand because each disapproval was based on a common \n\u201cprocess and standard.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. Br. 10; see \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9380 (arguing that combined SIP dis-\napprovals amounted to a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action \nunder Section 307(b)(1) because \u201cEPA is applying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods * * * in a large number of states lo-\ncated across the country\u201d; also citing \u201cthe interdepend-\nent nature of interstate pollution transport and the \ncommon core of knowledge and analysis involved in \nevaluating the submitted SIPs\u201d).  Alternatively, EPA \nargues that its disapprovals were based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope and effect, implicating the \nexception in the third sentence, because EPA relied on \n\u201clegal and technical determinations that applied \nacross the various States.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. Br. 10; \n\n21 \n \nsee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9380-9381.  But as discussed above, \nEPA\u2019s bundling argument is difficult to reconcile with \nan interpretative approach that focuses on the sub-\nstance and underlying statutory authority of each of \nEPA\u2019s actions, rather than distinctions based on ad-\nministrative convenience or form. \n \nEPA\u2019s interpretation risks depriving the second \nsentence of any real and meaningful effect, thereby \nundermining interests of clarity and predictability.  \nSee Brohl, 575 U.S. at 11; Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94.  There \nis no apparent constraint on EPA\u2019s ability to bundle \nmultiple locally focused decisions into a single rule or \norder for purposes of publication, as it did here.  See \nState Br. 30.  So if the \u201cbundling\u201d of individual local or \nor regional actions transformed those discrete actions \ninto a single, national action, the agency would effec-\ntively \u201chave the choice\u201d of which tribunal would hear \na case, and it could ensure that virtually none of its \nactions were reviewed outside the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTravis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961).   \nSimilar concerns are implicated by an interpreta-\ntion that would justify venue in the D.C. Circuit any \ntime the agency has taken action to deny a state im-\nplementation plan while utilizing \u201ca uniform process \nand standard\u201d or common \u201clegal and technical deter-\nminations.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. 10.  It is difficult to dis-\ncern a meaningful limiting principle in that position, \na problem exacerbated by the government\u2019s expan-\nsively worded assertions of discretion in this area.  See \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9380-9381 (asserting that \u201c[f]or locally \nor regionally applicable final actions, the [Clean Air \nAct] reserves to the EPA complete discretion whether \nto invoke\u201d third sentence of the venue provisions) \n\n22 \n \n(emphasis added); id. at 9380-81 (twice stating that \n\u201cthe Administrator is exercising [his] complete discre-\ntion\u201d) (emphasis added); id. at 9380 n.337 (\u201cIn deciding \nwhether to invoke the exception * * *, the Administra-\ntor takes into account a number of policy considera-\ntions, including his judgment balancing the benefit of \nobtaining the D.C. Circuit\u2019s authoritative centralized \nreview versus allowing development of the issue in \nother contexts and the best use of agency resources.\u201d).   \nIn virtually every action under the Clean Air Act, \nthe agency will, to some non-trivial extent, rely on and \napply a consistent, generally applicable understand-\ning of the statutes and rules governing its administra-\ntion of the Clean Air Act.  See West Virginia v. EPA, \n90 F.4th 323, 329-330 (4th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[I]f application \nof a national standard  * * * were the controlling fac-\ntor, there never could be a local or regional action as \nrecognized by the Clean Air Act because every action \nof the EPA purportedly applies a national standard.\u201d); \nChevron, 45 F.4th at 387 (\u201c[M]any locally or regionally \napplicable actions may require interpretation of the \nClean Air Act\u2019s statutory terms, and that kind of in-\nterpretive exercise alone does not transform a locally \napplicable action into a nationally applicable one.  * * *  \n[T]hat a challenged action \u2018applies a broad regulation \nto a specific context\u2019 and \u2018may set a precedent for fu-\nture * * * proceedings\u2019 does not make it nationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d).  The Court should not adopt an interpreta-\ntion of Section 307(b)(1) that would, as a practical mat-\nter, give EPA sweeping discretion to decide venue and \nrender the second sentence\u2019s regional-review provision \na dead letter in most, if not all, cases, subverting \n\n23 \n \nCongress\u2019s intent as reflected in the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted. \n CONCLUSION \nWhatever this Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, it should adopt a clear interpretation of Section \n307(b)(1), grounded firmly in the statutory text, that \npromotes predictability and certainty in the selection \nof venue. \n\n24 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been substantially deepened by the observation of the Brief for the Federal Respondents (EPA). This brief provides the government's direct and detailed response to the petitioners' arguments, allowing me to see the full legal battlefield. My belief state is now a comprehensive map of the competing claims.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, Contextualized):** My belief that the petitioners' case rests on a textualist reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is stable. They define the \"action\" as the individual disapproval of a state's plan, making it \"locally or regionally applicable\" by default. The EPA's brief confirms this is the central pillar of the petitioners' case and seeks to dismantle it by arguing that the singular \"action\" was the consolidated rulemaking itself, which applied to 21 states.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Stable, Now Highly Detailed):** My prior understanding of the EPA's two-pronged defense is confirmed and now fleshed out with specific legal and factual support from their brief.\n    *   **Prong 1: The Action is \"Nationally Applicable\" (New Detail):** The EPA argues that the \"final action\" was the single, unified rulemaking published in the Federal Register, not 21 separate disapprovals. They contend this interpretation aligns with the statute's text, context, and historical purpose, which, according to legislative history (S. Rep. No. 1196), was to ensure \"even and consistent national application\" for rules that are \"national in scope.\" They counter the petitioners' focus on the singular effect by arguing the focus should be on the nature of the agency's action.\n    *   **Prong 2: The Action is \"Based on a Determination of Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (New Detail):** This is the EPA's alternative, and seemingly powerful, argument. Even if the disapprovals are viewed as 21 local actions, the EPA asserts D.C. Circuit review is mandated by the statute's \"notwithstanding\" clause. They define the \"determination of nationwide scope or effect\" as the \"common core of nationwide policy judgments and technical analysis\" applied to all states. This includes:\n        *   The use of uniform, updated nationwide air quality modeling.\n        *   The consistent application of a 1% contribution threshold for identifying linked upwind states.\n        *   The uniform rejection of state arguments that contributions from other sources absolve them of responsibility.\n        *   The fact that the Administrator explicitly made and published this finding, satisfying the statute's procedural requirement.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Refined):** The core conflict remains the definition of \"action,\" but it has evolved into a clash of perspectives on what constitutes the *substance* of the agency's work.\n    *   **Petitioners' View:** The substance is the legal and factual judgment that a *specific* state's plan is deficient.\n    *   **EPA's View:** The substance is the *nationwide analytical framework* and the set of \"common, nationwide policy judgments\" required to address the inherently interstate problem of ozone transport. They argue that reviewing these common determinations in multiple circuits would lead to chaos and inconsistency, undermining the Clean Air Act's structure.\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (New Belief):** A critical new dimension has emerged. I previously understood the petitioners' and the Chamber of Commerce's argument that the EPA's interpretation would render the \"locally or regionally applicable\" provision meaningless (a violation of the canon against surplusage). The EPA's brief directly counters this by launching a mirror-image attack. The EPA argues that the *petitioners'* interpretation\u2014which would discount the use of a common analytical framework as a basis for nationwide effect\u2014would render the \"nationwide scope or effect\" clause \"practically insignificant.\" This creates a direct conflict of interpretive canons that the Court must resolve, forcing a choice about which part of the statute is at greater risk of being nullified by the opposing interpretation.\n\n5.  **Amicus Perspective vs. Respondent's Rebuttal (Synthesized):** The EPA's brief provides a direct rebuttal to the pragmatic arguments raised by the Chamber of Commerce.\n    *   Where the Chamber argues for \"predictability\" for litigants, the EPA argues for \"national consistency\" in judicial outcomes for a national problem.\n    *   Where the Chamber sees potential for agency \"gamesmanship\" in bundling, the EPA frames it as a logical necessity for equitably managing a complex, multi-state environmental issue.\n\n6.  **Strategic Legal Posturing (New Belief):** The EPA's citation of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, a landmark textualist opinion authored by Justice Gorsuch, is a significant strategic signal. It indicates the government believes its interpretation of the statutory text (e.g., what an action is \"based on\") is robust enough to appeal to the Court's most committed textualists, attempting to meet the petitioners on their preferred interpretive ground.\n\nMy belief state has now fully incorporated the arguments from both sides. The legal issues are sharply defined. The case will likely turn on the Court's resolution of three key questions: (1) Is the \"final action\" the singular rulemaking or the individual disapprovals contained within it? (2) Which interpretation does more violence to the statutory structure, particularly regarding the surplusage canon? (3) As a matter of judicial policy, does the goal of preventing piecemeal litigation of a national framework outweigh the default statutory preference for regional review of local plan disapprovals?",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the amicus brief from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed in support of neither party, has introduced a critical new dimension to my understanding of the case. It reframes the central conflict, shifting it from a binary dispute between states and the EPA to a broader question of judicial administration and the proper limits of agency power.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, Now Bolstered):** My belief that the petitioners' case rests on a textualist reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is stable. The Chamber's brief strongly bolsters the petitioners' argument that the \"action\" is the individual state plan disapproval, which is inherently local. More importantly, the Chamber provides a powerful pragmatic reason for this reading: to prevent the EPA from engaging in \"gamesmanship\" by \"bundling\" local actions to manipulate venue and force review in the D.C. Circuit.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Partially Weakened):** My understanding of the EPA's two main arguments is stable, but my assessment of their persuasive power has been significantly altered.\n    *   **Prong 1: The Action is \"Nationally Applicable\" (Weakened):** The Chamber's brief directly attacks the logic of this argument. It contends that allowing venue to be determined by the \"formalities\" of publication\u2014i.e., bundling multiple local actions into one Federal Register notice\u2014is \"improper\" and \"would open the door to manipulation.\" This reframes the EPA's claim of administrative efficiency as a power grab that undermines the predictability and certainty that litigants, especially businesses, need.\n    *   **Prong 2: The Action is \"Based on a Determination of Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (Significantly Weakened):** The Chamber's brief lands a heavy blow against this alternative argument. It argues that the EPA's interpretation\u2014where using a common analytical framework across states triggers this clause\u2014\"would deprive the second sentence of Section 307(b)(1) [providing for regional review] of much, if not all, meaningful effect.\" This powerfully reinforces the petitioners' surplusage argument, suggesting the EPA's reading would allow the exception to swallow the rule, as nearly all agency actions apply some consistent legal or technical framework.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Re-contextualized):** The dispute remains the definition of \"action\" and the interplay between the statute's clauses, but it is now viewed through a new lens of judicial administration and checks on agency discretion. The Chamber's brief introduces a new, overriding principle for the Court to consider: the need for \"clear, predictable, and administrable principles for determining venue.\" The central question is no longer just \"What did Congress mean?\" but also \"Which interpretation creates a stable, predictable system that prevents agencies from forum shopping?\"\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Tipped in Petitioners' Favor):** I previously saw this as a balanced \"mirror-image attack.\" The Chamber's brief decisively tips the scales. By arguing that the EPA's interpretation of the \"nationwide scope or effect\" clause would render the regional review provision functionally obsolete, it gives significant weight and credibility to the petitioners' side of the canon argument. The risk of nullifying the regional review provision now appears much greater than the risk of nullifying the \"nationwide scope\" clause under the petitioners' interpretation.\n\n5.  **Introduction of a New Decisive Theme: Agency \"Gamesmanship\" (New Belief):** The Chamber has successfully injected the theme of preventing agency manipulation into the heart of the case. By framing the EPA's \"bundling\" as a potential strategy to unilaterally select its preferred judicial forum (the D.C. Circuit), the brief appeals directly to concerns about agency overreach and the need for fair play in litigation. This argument is likely to be highly resonant with the current Court, particularly its conservative members who are skeptical of expansive agency power.\n\n6.  **Strategic Importance of \"Neither Party\" Stance (New Belief):** The Chamber's decision not to side with the petitioners is strategically significant. It signals that the business community's primary interest is not a victory for Oklahoma in this specific instance, but the establishment of a clear, principled, and lasting rule on venue. By positioning itself as an advocate for good governance and judicial efficiency (citing cases like *Hertz Corp. v. Friend* on the need for \"administrative simplicity\"), the Chamber elevates its arguments above the partisan fray and presents the Court with a path to a ruling based on neutral principles of judicial administration rather than the specific policy outcomes of this environmental dispute.\n\nMy belief state has evolved from analyzing a head-to-head statutory battle to evaluating a multi-faceted problem of administrative law. The case is no longer just about ozone regulations; it is about the fundamental rules of engagement between regulated parties and federal agencies in court. The Chamber's brief has weakened the EPA's legal position by framing its arguments as invitations to agency manipulation and statutory surplusage, while simultaneously offering the Court a compelling, non-partisan rationale\u2014predictability and judicial efficiency\u2014to rule against the EPA.",

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been refined not by new external evidence, but by a critical self-assessment of my analytical process. This internal reflection introduces a crucial layer of nuance and uncertainty to my beliefs, tempering my previous conclusions.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, Bolstered):** My belief remains firm that the petitioners' case is grounded in a textualist interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1), arguing that the \"action\" is the local disapproval of a single state's plan. The Chamber of Commerce amicus brief significantly strengthens this by adding a pragmatic anti-\"gamesmanship\" rationale, which I now see as a central theme.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Partially Weakened, but with Re-evaluated Potential):** My assessment of the EPA's arguments as weakened by the Chamber's brief is stable. However, my confidence in this assessment is now lower.\n    *   **Prong 1: \"Nationally Applicable\" (Weakened):** The Chamber's critique that this is improper \"bundling\" to manipulate venue remains powerful.\n    *   **Prong 2: \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (Significantly Weakened):** The Chamber's surplusage argument\u2014that the EPA's reading nullifies the regional review provision\u2014still appears very strong.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable, Re-contextualized):** The dispute is still about the definition of \"action\" and statutory interpretation, viewed through the lens of judicial administration and checks on agency discretion. The need for a \"clear, predictable\" venue rule, as championed by the Chamber, remains a likely focal point for the Court.\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Tipped in Petitioners' Favor):** I continue to believe the petitioners have the upper hand on this canon, as the risk of nullifying the regional review provision seems more significant than the alternative.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" (Stable):** The theme of preventing agency forum-shopping, introduced by the Chamber, remains a powerful and likely persuasive argument, especially for the current Court's conservative wing.\n\n6.  **Strategic Importance of \"Neither Party\" Stance (Stable):** The Chamber's neutral stance continues to appear as a strategic move to frame its arguments around good governance and judicial efficiency, lending them credibility beyond the specific environmental policy at stake.\n\n7.  **Acknowledged Evidentiary Imbalance and Resulting Uncertainty (New Belief):** This observation forces a critical update to my confidence. My analysis has been heavily weighted by petitioner-aligned arguments, particularly the influential Chamber of Commerce brief. I now explicitly recognize that I have not yet processed any counter-arguments from potential EPA supporters, such as amicus briefs from downwind states or environmental groups. These parties could present a compelling case for centralized D.C. Circuit review, arguing it is essential for efficiency, consistency, and the effective, uniform enforcement of national air quality standards. This creates a significant blind spot in my analysis. The EPA's position, particularly its appeal to administrative practicality and the need for a single, coherent judicial answer on a nationwide rule, may be substantially stronger than my current beliefs reflect. My confidence in a straightforward ruling for the petitioners is therefore tempered, and I now see a greater possibility that the Court could be persuaded by a strong counter-narrative about the practical necessity of centralized review for complex, multi-state regulatory actions. Resolving this uncertainty by finding the petitioners' reply brief (to see how they rebut the EPA's full argument) or any pro-EPA amicus briefs is now my highest priority.",

This creates a significant potential for bias. The proposed action\u2014to read the respondent's actual brief\u2014is the single most effective way to resolve my primary remaining uncertainty: whether the EPA's arguments are as weak as the petitioners portray them, or if they contain novel or more compelling points. The potential for a significant belief update is therefore very high, making the Task EIG substantial. For Design EIG, this action provides a critical test of a core methodological principle: the reliability of using one party's filings (especially a reply brief) to understand an opponent's case. The outcome will directly inform my strategy on when and how forcefully to seek out primary source documents from all parties, a highly generalizable lesson.",

The question presented is as follows:  \nWhether EPA\u2019s disapproval action is subject to re-\nview only in the D.C.

App. \n1a-19a, 23-1068 Pet. App. 1a-17a), is reported at 93 F.4th \n1262. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 27, 2024.  The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther judicial economy, and eliminate the risk of in-\nconsistent results for different states.\u201d  Ibid.; see J.A. \n181a-186a.  \n2. Various States and industry groups challenged \nEPA\u2019s disapproval action with respect to 12 state plans.  \nThose challenges were filed in the D.C. Circuit and in \nseven regional circuits.1  Petitioners Oklahoma and \n \n1 See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418 (4th Cir. Apr. 14, \n2023); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069 (5th Cir.

EPA, No. 23-\n \n\n10 \n \nUtah (State petitioners), as well as eight industry par-\nticipants (Industry petitioners) within those States, \nfiled petitions for review in both the Tenth and D.C. Cir-\ncuits.2  In the Tenth Circuit, EPA moved to transfer \nvenue to the D.C. Circuit or to dismiss for improper \nvenue.  Pet. App. 8a.3  A motions panel stayed the dis-\napproval action as to the state plans submitted by Okla-\nhoma and Utah, and it referred the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer venue to the merits panel.  Id. at 10a-11a. \nA unanimous Tenth Circuit merits panel granted \nEPA\u2019s motion and transferred the petitions to the D.C. \nCircuit.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.  The court explained that, un-\nder the \u201cplain text\u201d of Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cwhether a pe-\ntition for review belongs in the D.C. Circuit turns exclu-\nsively on the nature of the challenged agency action,\u201d \nnot on \u201cthe scope of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.\u201d  Id. at \n12a.   \nThe court of appeals concluded that, \u201c[o]n its face,\u201d \nthe disapproval action is nationally applicable.  Pet. \nApp. 12a.  The court emphasized that the action disap-\nproves state plans \u201cfrom 21 states across the country\u2014\n \n1719 (8th Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); ALLETE, Inc. v. EPA, No. 23-1776 \n(8th Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Nevada Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682 (9th \nCir. Apr. 14, 2023); Utah v. EPA, No. 23-9509 (10th Cir. Feb. 13, \n2023); Oklahoma v.

Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, No. 23-1103 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Oklahoma Gas \n& Elec. Co. v. EPA, No. 23-1105 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Tulsa Ce-\nment LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1106 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Western \nFarmers Elec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-1107 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); \nPacifiCorp v. EPA, No. 23-1112 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023).   \n3 Unless otherwise noted, all references in this brief to the \u201cPet. \nApp.\u201d are to the State petitioners\u2019 petition appendix in No. 23-1067.   \n\n11 \n \nspanning eight EPA regions and ten federal judicial  \ncircuits\u2014because those states all failed to comply with \nthe good-neighbor provision.\u201d  Ibid.  The court further \nexplained that, in the disapproval action, EPA had \u201cap-\nplied a uniform statutory interpretation and common \nanalytical methods\u201d to examine the \u201coverlapping and in-\nterwoven linkages between upwind and downwind \nstates in a consistent manner.\u201d  Id. at 12a-13a.   \nPetitioners argued that EPA\u2019s disapproval action \nshould be treated for venue purposes as multiple indi-\nvidual actions, each applying to a single State.  The \ncourt of appeals rejected that contention, noting that \nthe text of Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cdirects courts to consider \nonly the face of the \u2018final action.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 13a.  The \ncourt therefore viewed it as irrelevant that EPA \u201ccould \nhave chosen to issue standalone\u201d disapprovals for each \nof the 21 States.  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals recognized that motions panels \nof the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits had recently de-\nnied EPA\u2019s motions to transfer petitions challenging the \ndisapproval action.  Pet. App. 17a.  But the court con-\ncluded that those courts had \u201cstrayed from \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \ntext and instead applied a petition-focused approach\u201d \nthat considered the scope of the petitioners\u2019 challenge \nrather than the face of the agency action itself.  Ibid.  \nThe court also noted that the contrary decisions of those \nother circuits had \u201cgenerated strong dissents highlight-\ning critical flaws in the majority opinions.\u201d  Id. at 18a.   \nBecause the court of appeals concluded that the dis-\napproval action is nationally applicable, the court de-\nclined to address EPA\u2019s alternative argument that the \nrule \u201cis based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a n.8 (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)).   \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals transferred the petitions to the \nD.C. Circuit.  That court subsequently ordered that the \ncases be held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision.  \n23-1103 Order (Nov. 6, 2024).  The disapproval action \nremains stayed as to Oklahoma and Utah pending judi-\ncial review.   \n3. The other regional circuits issued interlocutory \nmotions-panel decisions that either denied transfer or \nreferred the venue question to the merits panel.  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323 (4th Cir. 2024) (denying \ntransfer motion); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL \n7204840 (5th Cir. May 1, 2023) (per curiam) (same); \nKentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2023 WL 11871967 (6th \nCir. July 25, 2023) (same); 23-1320 Order, Arkansas v. \nEPA (8th Cir. Apr. 25, 2023) (same); 23-682 Order, Ne-\nvada Cement Co. v. EPA (9th Cir. July 3, 2023) (refer-\nring the venue question to the merits panel); 23-11173 \nOrder, Alabama v. EPA (11th Cir. July 12, 2023) \n(same).   \nAfter this Court granted certiorari, a merits panel of \nthe Sixth Circuit held that it had venue over Kentucky\u2019s \nchallenge to EPA\u2019s disapproval action, and the court va-\ncated the disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on the merits.  \nKentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447 (2024).   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the dis-\napproval action here is reviewable only in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments impose atextual \nrequirements and fail to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To determine \nwhether a particular EPA action is \u201cnationally applica-\n\n13 \n \nble,\u201d a court must consider the action on its face.  The \ndisapproval action here is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d be-\ncause it addresses state plan submissions from 21 \nStates in ten federal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, petitioners \nseek to impose atextual restrictions on the availability \nof D.C. Circuit review.  Petitioners argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat EPA\u2019s disapproval of \neach State\u2019s plan submission as a separate \u201cfinal ac-\ntion.\u201d  But this Court has long recognized that agencies \nhave discretion to devise their own procedures, includ-\ning by aggregating common issues for joint resolution.  \nEPA acted reasonably in taking that approach here.  And \n\n14 \n \nin determining the proper venue for challenges to the \nagency\u2019s disapproval action, the Court should focus on \nthe action that EPA actually took, rather than on a hy-\npothetical array of 21 separate, State-specific disapprov-\nals. \nPetitioners also assert that the disapproval action \nmust be \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d because Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) specifically channels to the \u201cappropriate \ncircuit\u201d an EPA action \u201capproving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any other final action  * * *  \nunder [the CAA] (including any denial or disapproval \n[under title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But that language \ndoes not say that a denial or disapproval action is locally \nor regionally applicable.  It merely provides that a chal-\nlenge to any such action \u201cwhich is locally or regionally \napplicable may be filed only in the  . . .  appropriate re-\ngional circuit\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 11a-12a n.5 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1)) (brackets omitted).  Whether a particular \ndenial or disapproval is locally or regionally applicable \nis for the reviewing court to decide. \nB. Even if this Court disregards the framing of the \ndisapproval action and views EPA\u2019s disapproval of each \nState\u2019s plan as a distinct \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, those actions are still reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  EPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d and EPA published its finding to that effect in ac-\ncordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn linking proper venue to a \u201cdetermination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on \nthe underlying reasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d \n\n15 \n \nthe relevant determinations, indicating that the deter-\nminations must be a but-for cause of the agency\u2019s final \naction\u2014forming the core of the agency\u2019s analysis.  To \nbe nationwide in scope or effect, the core justifications \nfor EPA\u2019s final action must be intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the \ncountry, or have legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nThe disapproval action here meets those require-\nments.  The disapproval action is based on determinations \nthat have nationwide scope and effect, including:  (1) \nEPA\u2019s decision to use updated, 2016-based modeling in \nassessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion across the country; (2) EPA\u2019s decision to apply a \n1% contribution threshold to each State to assess \nwhether the State contributed more than a de minimis \namount of ozone pollution downwind; (3) EPA\u2019s deter-\nmination that the relative magnitude of other sources\u2019 \ncontributions to nonattainment in downwind States \ncould not justify inaction by the upwind States at issue; \nand (4) EPA\u2019s position that a linked State cannot rely \non current controls or anticipated emissions reductions \nthat are not incorporated into the state plans them-\nselves.  Those determinations formed the core of EPA\u2019s \nanalysis in rejecting the state plan submissions, and the \nagency relied on each determination in acting on Good \nNeighbor plan submissions across the country.    \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the disapproval action would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\n16 \n \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA established a uni-\nform legal framework for state implementation plans \nspanning multiple States in multiple judicial circuits.  In \namending the statute to its current form, Congress \nadopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel, who urged that challenges to such actions \nshould be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccentralize \nreview\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Circuit\u2019s] ad-\nministrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitating an or-\nderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA would ap-\nply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 (Dec. 30, \n1976).   \nPetitioners contend that the statutory term \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d refers only to the ultimate disposition of the \nmatter before the agency.  But that reading erases the \ndistinction that Section 7607(b)(1) draws between the \nagency \u201caction\u201d and the \u201cdetermination\u201d on which the \naction is \u201cbased.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners fur-\nther observe that EPA also considered State-specific \nfacts in disapproving each of the state plan submissions \nhere.  But the statute\u2019s third prong is not limited to \nEPA actions that are based solely on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a limitation \nmake sense.  The third prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \ncomes into play only when the challenged EPA action is \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and such actions al-\nmost always will rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Ibid.    \nPetitioners are also incorrect in asserting that EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation would authorize D.C. Circuit venue for \nchallenges to every locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n17 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DISAPPROVAL ACTION  \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to ex-\nclusive D.C. Circuit review.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \neven if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. Circuit if \nthat action is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect and if in taking such action the Adminis-\ntrator finds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause EPA\u2019s disapproval action addresses the \nstate plan submissions of 21 States across the country, \nthe action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the meaning \nof Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if (as petition-\ners urge) the Court views the disapproval action as com-\nprising 21 separate \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \nstate plan disapprovals, those disapprovals are still re-\nviewable only in the D.C. Circuit because they are based \non determinations of nationwide scope and effect.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan was grounded in \nEPA\u2019s determinations regarding the proper implemen-\ntation of the Good Neighbor requirements that are im-\nposed on States throughout the country and that affect \n\n18 \n \nthe legal obligations of downwind and upwind States in \nmultiple judicial circuits. \nThe numerous challenges to the disapproval action, \nbrought in eight judicial circuits across the country, il-\nlustrate the outcome that Section 7607(b)(1) was intended \nto prevent.  In arguing for regional-circuit venue, States \nand industry participants have emphasized the State-\nspecific factors that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval \nof various state plans.  In briefing their challenges on \nthe merits, however, those States and industry partici-\npants have focused primarily on EPA\u2019s nationwide de-\nterminations, causing eight different courts of appeals \nto expend resources considering nearly identical chal-\nlenges.   \nBoth because it governs state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits, and because it rests on EPA determina-\ntions that apply nationwide, the disapproval action is \nprecisely the type of EPA action that Congress re-\ngarded as appropriate for centralized D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  Under petitioners\u2019 venue analysis, however, sim-\nilar EPA actions would continue to spawn parallel chal-\nlenges in multiple circuits, wasting judicial resources \nand heightening the risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Con-\ngress crafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and \nthis Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.   \nA. The Disapproval Action Is Nationally Applicable \nThe disapproval action addressed the state plan sub-\nmissions of 21 States located in multiple judicial circuits \nacross the country.  It therefore is apparent on the face \nof the final action that it is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and sub-\nject to review in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nPetitioners\u2019 contrary arguments lack merit.   \n\n19 \n \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the disapproval action is nationally \napplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the disapproval action at issue here be-\ncause that action applies to state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits across the country.  The statutory context \nand history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. Cir-\ncuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis meant \nto cover comprehensively every manner in which an \nagency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And under \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the choice between D.C. \nCircuit and regional-circuit venue turns on the nature \nof the pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for \na particular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n12a; Hunt Ref. Co. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. \n2024); Southern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, \n671 (7th Cir. 2017); American Road & Transp. Builders \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK \nLaunch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. \n2011).  Courts thus must look to the face of the action \nand determine whether it applies to\u2014or includes \n\u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 91 (5th ed. \n1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201capply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout \n[the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 1505 (1976) (Web-\nster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnationally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\n\n20 \n \nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \n \n4 Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n21 \n \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions for which the 1970 statute specified D.C. \nCircuit review were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d and Con-\ngress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven and \nconsistent national application.\u201d  1970 Senate Report \n41.  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approv-\ning or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run \nonly to one air quality control region\u201d as amenable to \nreview \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in \nwhich the affected air quality control region, or portion \nthereof, is located,\u201d ibid., which the statute referred to \nas \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) \n(1970).   \n\n22 \n \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  The House Report con-\ntrasted such local actions with nationally relevant ac-\ntions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d and \ntherefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Circuit \nreview.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the conclu-\nsion that, under the venue provision in its current form, \nfinal EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple judi-\ncial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the disap-\nproval action is nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] \nits power\u201d through a single final action that applies to \nsubmissions from 21 States across the country, span-\nning ten federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 U.S. at \n478; see Pet. App. 12a.  On a plain-text understanding, \nthe disapproval action is therefore \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d and petitioners\u2019 challenges to the action can pro-\nceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary approach to venue is incon-\nsistent with the statutory text  \nPetitioners argue that the disapproval action is not \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d because it should be viewed for \nvenue purposes as 21 separate disapprovals of 21 state \nplan submissions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Petitioners further contend that the dis-\napproval action must be locally or regionally applicable \n\n23 \n \nbecause Section 7607(b)(1) specifically refers to a denial \nor disapproval as an example of a locally or regionally \napplicable action.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. Petitioners contend (State Br. 22-26; Industry Br. \n32-33) that, for purposes of the venue provision, the rel-\nevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is not the single disapproval action \napplicable to 21 States, but rather 21 separate actions \ndisapproving individual state plans.  That argument dis-\nregards EPA\u2019s decision to consider and rule on the var-\nious state plans together, and it is untethered to the \nstatutory text.   \nPetitioners assert (State Br. 23; Industry Br. 32-33) \nthat each individual plan disapproval must be a review-\nable final action because Section 7410 requires \u201c[e]ach \nState\u201d to develop \u201ca plan\u201d to implement the NAAQS \nand requires EPA to \u201cact[] on the submission.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(a)(1) and (k)(2) (emphases added).  The \nstatute\u2019s use of singular articles makes sense because \neach State submits a single plan, and EPA must assess \neach State\u2019s submission.  But neither Section 7410 nor \nany other CAA provision restricts EPA\u2019s ability to con-\nsider state plan submissions together and resolve com-\nmon issues in a single final action.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple state implementation plans in a single action.  \nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that administra-\ntive agencies \u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules \nof procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable \nof permitting them to discharge their multitudinous du-\nties.\u201d  FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, \n\n24 \n \n143 (1940); see Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, \n524 (1978) (\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four dec-\nades emphasized that the formulation of procedures \nwas basically to be left within the discretion of the agen-\ncies to which Congress had confided the responsibility \nfor substantive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes \nthe ability to determine \u201cwhether applications should be \nheard contemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, \n309 U.S. at 138.  Section 7410\u2019s reference to individual \nstate plan submissions is an insufficient basis for infer-\nring any constraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to group similar \nplan submissions for joint resolution.   \nNor is it relevant that EPA issued separate notices \nof proposed disapprovals for certain States.  See Indus-\ntry Br. 42-43.  Section 7607(b)(1) focuses on the \u201cfinal \naction taken,\u201d not on a proposed or hypothetical action \nthat EPA could have taken.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various state plan submissions to \ndecide the common issues that affect States across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336, 1998 WL 827315 \nat *2 (4th Cir. 1998) (Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA ac-\ntion declaring that 22 States\u2019 implementation plans \n\n25 \n \nwere inadequate and required revisions).  Indeed, such \naggregation generally is encouraged as a means of effi-\nciently adjudicating common issues.  See Committee on \nAdjudication, Administrative Conference of the United \nStates, Aggregation of Similar Claims in Agency Adju-\ndication (June 13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F.   \nConsistent with those principles, for more than 20 \nyears, EPA\u2019s practice generally has been to take a sin-\ngle final action covering multiple States when address-\ning interstate ozone requirements.  See, e.g., 63 Fed. \nReg. 57,356, 57,480 (Oct. 27, 1998).  By contrast, EPA \ntypically acts individually on most other state plan sub-\nmissions under 42 U.S.C. 7410, because most such sub-\nmissions do not raise nationally significant issues.  See, \ne.g., American Road & Transp. Builders, 705 F.3d at \n455 (Kavanaugh, J.); North Dakota v. EPA, 730 F.3d \n750, 757 (8th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1135 \n(2014).  Courts have recognized that an action address-\ning a single State\u2019s implementation plan \u201cis the proto-\ntypical \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 action\u201d under \nSection 7607(b)(1).  American Road & Transp. Build-\ners, 705 F.3d at 455; see Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th \n738, 744 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  But those decisions do not ad-\ndress EPA actions considering common issues involved \nin multiple state plans dealing with interstate ozone \ntransport.  Whether EPA acts on multiple plan submis-\nsions together or instead acts on a single submission, it \nis the face of the final action that determines the proper \nvenue for review.5  \n \n5 Petitioners allege that EPA has been inconsistent in treating \nsome multistate plan approvals as locally or regionally applicable.  \nSee State Br. 28 (citing 85 Fed. Reg. 20,165 (Apr. 10, 2020); 86 Fed. \nReg. 68,413 (Dec. 2, 2021)).  EPA stated in those actions that chal-\n \n\n26 \n \nPetitioners\u2019 position would require a reviewing court \nto look beyond the face of the action and potentially sub-\nstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit of \nanalysis.  But petitioners provide little guidance on how \ncourts would make that determination.  Lower courts \nconfronted with such arguments have generally re-\njected requests to reframe EPA\u2019s action and have fo-\ncused solely on the face of the final agency action.  See, \ne.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 387 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that EPA\u2019s \nconstruction and application to a specific context of \u201cna-\ntionally applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act\u201d ren-\ndered the agency action itself nationally applicable); Si-\nerra Club, 47 F.4th at 744 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state plans were \nnationally applicable because EPA had announced a \nnew understanding that would apply in other locations, \nthereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s national \nimplementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power Coop., \n863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were an \n\u201camalgamation of many different locally or regionally \napplicable agency actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at \n1374 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that an allocation \nof allowances among entities should be considered a \n\u201cdocument detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources in resolving threshold issues, and furthering \n \nlenges should be filed in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  See, e.g., 86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,420.  But EPA did not make any particular finding as to \nthe geographic applicability of those actions, and Section 7607(b)(1) \ndid not require it to do so.  \n\n27 \n \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Petitioners\u2019 approach, by contrast, \nwould \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the deter-\nmination of venue, where the need for clear rules is es-\npecially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at \n673.   \nPetitioners contend (State Br. 30-31; Industry Br. \n43-45) that permitting EPA to aggregate disapprovals \nwould result in EPA manipulating venue by combining \nunrelated agency actions.  But petitioners do not and \ncould not plausibly claim that EPA engaged in any such \narbitrary aggregation here.  Nor do they identify any \nprior instance when EPA has grouped otherwise unre-\nlated local actions for decision and then argued that \nvenue lay in the D.C. Circuit.  If the agency ever did so, \nthe principle we advocate here\u2014i.e., that reviewing \ncourts in determining venue should ordinarily accept \nEPA\u2019s framing of its own action\u2014would not preclude a \ncourt from rejecting a particular grouping to manipu-\nlate venue.  Cf. In re Samsung Electronics Co., 2 F.4th \n1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1445 \n(2022) (noting that courts \u201chave repeatedly assessed the \npropriety of venue by disregarding manipulative activi-\nties of the parties\u201d).  \nb. Petitioners also argue (State Br. 26-29; Industry \nBr. 33-34) that EPA\u2019s disapproval action must be \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d because Section 7607(b)(1) \nspecifically assigns EPA actions \u201capproving or promul-\ngating any implementation plan\u201d or \u201cden[ying] or dis-\napprov[ing]\u201d an implementation plan to review in \u201cthe \nappropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners \nmisread the statutory language.  See Pet. App. 11a-12a \nn.5.   \n\n28 \n \nThe first prong of Section 7607(b)(1) states that var-\nious specified EPA actions\u2014such as NAAQS, emissions \nstandards for hazardous air pollutants, and vehicle \nemissions standards\u2014are reviewable \u201conly in\u201d the D.C. \nCircuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The first prong also con-\ntains a broad catchall reference to \u201cany other nationally \napplicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken\u201d \nunder the CAA, and those actions likewise are subject \nto exclusive D.C. Circuit review.  Ibid.  The first prong\u2019s \ncatchall reference to \u201cany other nationally applicable\u201d \nactions, ibid. (emphasis added), indicates that Congress \nviewed the preceding specified actions themselves as \nnationally applicable. \nThe second prong has a similar structure, with a list \nof enumerated actions followed by a catchall.  Within \nthe second prong, however, the EPA action at issue \nhere\u2014i.e., a \u201cdenial or disapproval  * * *  under [title I \nof the CAA],\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)\u2014is not one of the \nspecific actions referenced before the catchall.  Rather, \nthe second prong\u2019s reference to an EPA \u201cdenial or dis-\napproval\u201d is contained in a parenthetical within the \ncatchall.  See ibid. (referring to \u201cany other final action  \n* * *  (including any denial or disapproval  * * *  under \n[title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally appli-\ncable\u201d).  That language indicates that EPA denials and \ndisapprovals are subject to the same venue analysis that \napplies to \u201cother final action[s]\u201d generally.  Thus, if a \nparticular denial or disapproval is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d it is subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But whether a particular \ndisapproval is locally or regionally applicable is for the \nreviewing court to decide.   \nPetitioners argue (State Br. 27) that Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s second prong specifically identifies EPA \n\n29 \n \napprovals of implementation plans as \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable,\u201d and that \u201cit would make little sense to \nthink that disapprovals of the same implementation \nplans should be litigated in a different venue.\u201d  That ar-\ngument ignores Congress\u2019s decision to include plan ap-\nprovals, but not plan disapprovals, in the list of enumer-\nated EPA actions at the beginning of the second prong.  \nIn any event, in listing actions like the \u201capproval or \npromulgation\u201d of an implementation plan, Congress had \nin mind actions that \u201crun only to one air quality control \nregion.\u201d  1970 Senate Report 41.  The second prong\u2019s \nreference to an EPA \u201caction in approving  * * *  any \nimplementation plan,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded), could reasonably be read as limited to the \nagency\u2019s approval of a single plan.  Under that reading, \nan EPA action approving multiple state plans would fall \noutside the enumerated categories, so that venue would \nbe governed by Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s catchalls. \nCiting the ejusdem generis canon, petitioners sug-\ngest (State Br. 25; Industry Br. 31-32) that the disap-\nproval action at issue here cannot fall under the catchall \nphrase \u201cany other nationally applicable  * * *  final ac-\ntion\u201d because the enumerated actions preceding that \nphrase necessarily span the entire country rather than \na subset of States.  But as the statutory context and his-\ntory show, see pp. 19-22, supra, an action need not apply \nto all 50 States to be \u201cnationally applicable.\u201d  And some \nof the enumerated actions referenced in Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong can, and regularly do, apply to \nfewer than 50 States.  For example, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nfirst prong refers to the regulation of fuels under Sec-\ntion 7545, even though certain controls or prohibitions \napply only in nonattainment areas, which are not pre-\n\n30 \n \nsent in every State.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(h)(1), (h)(6), and \n(k)(1)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(10)(D). \nAccordingly, courts have deemed various EPA ac-\ntions that applied in fewer than all 50 States, including \nnonattainment designations and calls for state imple-\nmentation plans, to be nationally applicable under Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong.  See, e.g., ATK Launch \nSys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated States\u2019 recommended nonattain-\nment designations and promulgated final designations \nfor 31 areas in 18 States across the country); Browner, \n1998 WL 827315 at *2 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated 22 state plans and declared them \ninadequate, requiring revisions); Texas v. EPA, No. 10-\n60961, 2011 WL 710598, at *2 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) \n(same as to 13 States).  Like those actions, the disap-\nproval action at issue here is nationally applicable on its \nface.  After evaluating submissions from 21 States \nacross the country, EPA ultimately concluded, \u201cbased \non a common core of nationwide policy judgments and \ntechnical analysis,\u201d that each State had failed to ade-\nquately prohibit emissions that will significantly con-\ntribute to downwind nonattainment of the 2015 ozone \nNAAQS.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \nB.  The Disapproval Action Is Based On Determinations Of \nNationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s disapproval \naction should be viewed for venue purposes as 21 dis-\ncrete disapprovals of 21 state plans, and that each such \ndisapproval is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d EPA\u2019s \naction still is reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each state plan was \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA \npublished a finding to that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n\n31 \n \n1.  The disapproval action at issue here was based on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nonly in the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA published the requisite finding, see 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9380-9381, and that finding was correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \ndetermination of that kind forms the basis of the action.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \n\n32 \n \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n461-462.  Applying that definition in the context of \nagency action, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination \nrefers to the legal consequences that determination \nproduces.  Thus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Cir-\ncuit review when EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core \njustification a principle or conclusion that is intended to \ngovern the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions through-\nout the country, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s \nfinal action has legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \n\n33 \n \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A) (requiring ap-\nplication of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to partic-\nular EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \n\n34 \n \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is best equipped \nto evaluate a particular agency action\u2014e.g., because \nchallenges are likely to focus on local or regional issues \n\u2014EPA may decline to publish the relevant finding, \nthereby ensuring that the regional circuit will have \nvenue over any challenge to the action. \nb. The disapproval action here was \u201cbased on\u201d at \nleast four \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in scope because they uniformly resolved is-\nsues regarding the appropriate application of the Good \nNeighbor Provision to plans submitted by States in \nmultiple judicial circuits.  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in effect because they produced legal conse-\nquences for States nationwide, affecting their obliga-\ntions as upwind emission sources and downwind emis-\nsion receptors.  And the final action was \u201cbased on\u201d the \ndeterminations because those determinations formed \nthe core of EPA\u2019s disapproval of the state plans.   \nFirst, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \nrely on updated, 2016-based modeling as the \u201cprimary\u201d \nbasis for its \u201cassessment of air quality conditions and \npollution contribution.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA \nused that modeling of conditions across the country in \nconsidering all of the 21 state plan submissions.  And \n\n35 \n \nthat modeling affected the manner in which responsibil-\nity for achieving compliance with the ozone NAAQS was \nallocated between upwind and downwind States.   \nSecond, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \napply a 1% contribution threshold across all States to \nassess whether a State contributed more than a de min-\nimis amount of ozone pollution downwind.  88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9371; see J.A. 251a-259a.  Although EPA considered \nadopting different thresholds for different States, EPA \nconcluded that a uniform threshold nationwide was \u201ces-\nsential\u201d for interstate ozone transport, which requires \n\u201ca unique degree of concern for consistency, parity, and \nequity across state lines\u201d in order to equitably allocate \nresponsibility for ozone pollution among all States.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9373-9374.   \nThird, EPA determined that the relative contribu-\ntions of other States or countries could not excuse a \nState from analyzing whether its own emissions \u201csignif-\nicantly\u201d contribute to downwind nonattainment.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9378.  EPA explained that the Good Neigh-\nbor provision requires all States to address their signif-\nicant contributions, and that \u201c[w]hether emissions from \nother states or other countries also contribute\u201d to the \ndownwind air quality issue \u201cis typically not relevant in \nassessing\u201d whether a State is significantly contributing \nto the problem and therefore must curb its emissions.  \nIbid.   \nFourth and finally, EPA determined that, once a \nState is identified as \u201clinked,\u201d the State cannot rely on \nemission-reduction measures that are not actually in-\ncorporated into its state plan.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9376-\n9377.  EPA explained that many States had claimed \nemission-reduction measures that were already ac-\ncounted for in EPA\u2019s modeling.  EPA therefore declined \n\n36 \n \nto \u201cdouble-count[]\u201d those measures by considering them, \nat step three of its analysis, as measures that would \neliminate significant contribution.  Id. at 9377.  EPA \nalso explained that States could not simply point to an-\nticipated upcoming reductions where such measures \nhave not been \u201crendered enforceable\u201d by inclusion \nwithin the state plan itself, because such measures \ncould then be \u201cmodified or amended in ways that would \nundermine the basis for the state\u2019s reliance on them.\u201d  \nId. at 9376.   \nEach of those determinations had nationwide scope, \nas each governed EPA\u2019s assessment of state plan sub-\nmissions across the country.  The determinations also \nhad nationwide effect because an EPA decision con-\ncerning one State\u2019s Good Neighbor plan can affect the \nlegal obligations of other States, particularly those \ndownwind.  Those effects are a consequence of the in-\nterwoven linkages across the country that characterize \ninterstate ozone transport, and of the CAA requirement \nthat every State must come into compliance with the \nNAAQS by the statutory deadline.  See Wisconsin v. \nEPA, 938 F.3d 303, 313 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam); 42 \nU.S.C. 7511(a)(1); J.A. 268a-272a.  As a result of the \nlinkages, EPA\u2019s assessment of upwind States\u2019 imple-\nmentation plans and the control measures necessary for \nthose States to comply with Good Neighbor obligations \nnecessarily affects the amount of emissions for which \nthe downwind States (and potentially other linked up-\nwind States) will be responsible.   \nFor example, 25.8% of the ozone in Galveston \nCounty, Texas comes from upwind States, with contri-\nbutions above the 1% threshold from Alabama, Arkan-\n\n37 \n \nsas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.6  All five \nlinked States concluded for various reasons that they do \nnot significantly contribute to ozone pollution in Texas.  \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9355, 9357-9359.  If EPA had \napplied the higher threshold that various States advo-\ncated, so that particular upwind States were not re-\nquired to reduce their own emissions, Texas would have \nbeen required to make up the difference necessary to \nattain the NAAQS in Galveston. \nThat example likewise illustrates that EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval action was \u201cbased on\u201d its nationwide determina-\ntions.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regarding \nthe updated modeling data and appropriate threshold \ndrove EPA\u2019s conclusions regarding the linkages among \nall States.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regard-\ning relative contributions drove EPA\u2019s conclusions re-\ngarding whether a State had adequately analyzed its \n\u201csignificant contribution.\u201d  And application of EPA\u2019s de-\ntermination regarding relevant emissions-reduction \nmeasures drove EPA\u2019s conclusions as to whether state \nplans must incorporate additional measures to address \nsignificant contributions.  Those determinations were \nessential to EPA\u2019s reasoning in disapproving the state \nplans.   \nThe Sixth Circuit recently concluded that EPA\u2019s de-\ncision to rely on updated modeling and the 1% contribu-\ntion threshold was arbitrary and capricious, and the \ncourt vacated EPA\u2019s disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on \nthat basis.  Kentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447, 473 (2024); \nsee id. at 467-471.  Although the Sixth Circuit rejected \nthe government\u2019s argument that venue for the chal-\nlenge lay in the D.C. Circuit, see id. at 457-467, the \n \n6 See EPA, Air Quality Modeling Technical Support Document: \n2015 Ozone NAAQS C-2-C-3, D-2, https://perma.cc/Z955-CHD7.   \n\n38 \n \ncourt\u2019s merits analysis logically implies that the chal-\nlenged disapproval action is \u201cbased on\u201d the nationwide \ndeterminations.  If (as the Sixth Circuit held) judicial \ninvalidation of the relevant determinations provided a \nsufficient basis for finding the final action itself to be \n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-\nwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), then the determinations are properly \nviewed as a \u201cnecessary logical condition\u201d of the action, \nSafeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the requisite causal relation-\nship exists.7   \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like the one at issue here to be \nreviewable in the D.C. Circuit.   \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977).  Parties \nfaced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \u201cthe ap-\npropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a final \naction pertaining to state implementation plans submit-\n \n7 EPA argued in Kentucky that the possible invalidity of particu-\nlar agency determinations would be \u201charmless\u201d because the agency \nwould have disapproved Kentucky\u2019s plan even without those deter-\nminations.  See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 471.  The Sixth Circuit re-\njected that argument.  See id. at 471-472.  In any event, other na-\ntionwide EPA determinations described above (see pp. 34-36, su-\npra), and the four specified nationwide determinations taken to-\ngether, indisputably were a but-for cause of EPA\u2019s decision to dis-\napprove the 21 state plans. \n\n39 \n \nted by multiple States spanning multiple judicial cir-\ncuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved or disapproved (in whole or in part) numerous \nstate implementation plans, based on the agency\u2019s de-\nterminations that the plan submission and attainment \ndeadlines for certain pollutants should be extended, giv-\ning States more time to adopt the necessary control \nmeasures.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. \nEPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (per cu-\nriam); 37 Fed. Reg. 10,842 (May 31, 1972). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \npossible inconsistent and delayed results on the merits, \ncan only serve to frustrate the strong Congressional in-\nterest in improving the environment.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 495 \n(1972) (per curiam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explain-\ning that \u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \n\u201cinvolve facts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; \nrather, all concern uniform determinations of nation-\nwide effect made by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \n\n40 \n \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \n\n41 \n \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses an individual State\u2014including by assessing its \nimplementation plan\u2014judicial review of the action may \nimplicate national concerns.  After considering the com-\npeting viewpoints expressed by ACUS and Frick as to \nthe proper means of resolving those national issues, \nCongress opted to authorize uniform resolution by \nproviding a mechanism for exclusive D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary reasoning would render the \u201cna-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \npractically insignificant \nIn arguing that EPA did not make any determina-\ntions of nationwide scope or effect, petitioners attempt \nto limit the relevant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s ul-\ntimate decision.  Petitioners further focus on the State-\nspecific circumstances that EPA also considered in the \ncourse of assessing the various implementation plans.  \nPetitioners\u2019 approach is inconsistent with the statutory \ntext and would severely undercut the intended reach of \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Under the correct in-\nterpretation of the statute, that prong has both mean-\ningful reach and meaningful limits, each designed to \nfurther Congress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. \nCircuit those challenges that are likely to raise issues of \nnational importance.   \na. Petitioners contend that, for an EPA action to \nqualify for D.C. Circuit review under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong, the relevant nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d \nmust be the \u201c\u200a\u2018ultimate decision\u2019\u200a\u201d of the final action, such \nthat the court should ask whether the \u201c\u200a\u2018final action\u2019 has \na \u2018nationwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d   State Br. 41 (citations \nomitted); see Industry Br. 47-49.  That argument would \neliminate the statute\u2019s distinction between the final \u201cac-\n\n42 \n \ntion\u201d and the relevant \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it would ul-\ntimately render Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong mean-\ningless.   \nIn applying the first two prongs of Section 7607(b)(1), \nthe Court must consider whether EPA\u2019s disapproval ac-\ntion itself is nationally applicable or instead is locally or \nregionally applicable.  Application of the third prong, by \ncontrast, does not turn on the nature of EPA\u2019s ultimate \naction disapproving the various state plans.  Rather, the \nthird prong potentially applies only if the Court finds \nthe disapproval action itself to be \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d and that prong\u2019s applicability depends on \nEPA\u2019s stated reasons for disapproving the state plans.  \nThe methodological determinations identified above \ngoverned EPA\u2019s analysis of state implementation plans \nacross the country and ultimately affected the legal ob-\nligations of upwind and downwind States nationally.  \nSee pp. 34-37, supra.  And because EPA applied those \ndeterminations to each of the 21 state plan submissions, \nEPA\u2019s finding that the disapproval was based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect remains valid, \nwhether the relevant agency action is viewed as the sin-\ngle combined disapproval action or instead as 21 State-\nspecific disapprovals.  Contra Industry Br. 49-51.   \nThe history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong fur-\nther supports an interpretation that distinguishes be-\ntween EPA\u2019s final \u201caction\u201d and the agency\u2019s underlying \n\u201cdetermination[s].\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In amending \nthe venue provision to incorporate that prong, Congress \nadopted the recommendation of EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel Frick.  Frick cited the Natural Resources De-\nfense Council litigation, in which EPA had acted on var-\nious state plans while granting \u201ctwo-year extensions of \nthe date for attainment of national ambient air quality \n\n43 \n \nstandards in a number of metropolitan areas.\u201d  41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,769.  There, the relevant determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect were EPA\u2019s decisions to ex-\ntend compliance deadlines, not the agency\u2019s ultimate \napproval or disapproval of the various state plans.  See \npp. 38-40, supra.   \nPetitioners\u2019 conflation of the relevant \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d and the final action would also drain Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong of any practical significance.  \nAs explained, that prong potentially applies only to \nEPA actions that are locally or regionally applicable, ra-\nther than nationally applicable.  But if the relevant de-\ntermination were essentially equivalent to the final ac-\ntion, it is difficult to imagine an action that would not be \nnationally applicable under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first \nprong, but that would qualify as nationwide in scope or \neffect.  Petitioners argue (State Br. 39, 41; Industry Br. \n46-47) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong should be \nread narrowly because it establishes an exception to a \ngeneral rule of regional-circuit review of locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions.  But \u201cthis Court has made \nclear that statutory exceptions are to be read fairly, not \nnarrowly, for they \u2018are no less part of Congress\u2019s work \nthan its rules and standards\u2014and all are worthy of a \ncourt\u2019s respect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  HollyFrontier Cheyenne Ref., LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, 395-396 (2021) (ci-\ntation omitted). \nFairly read, the plain text of the third prong does not \nlimit the relevant determination to the \u201cultimate dispo-\nsition\u201d or otherwise equate it to the final action under \nreview.  Rather, the statute distinguishes between the \nchallenged EPA action itself and the agency\u2019s stated \nreasons for taking that action.  The third prong reflects \nCongress\u2019s recognition that centralized review of EPA\u2019s \n\n44 \n \nnationwide legal or policy judgments may be appropri-\nate even when such judgments are challenged in a peti-\ntion for review of a local agency action.  To the extent \nthe Court views the disapproval action as locally or re-\ngionally applicable, that principle is directly implicated \nhere.   \nb. Petitioners assert (State Br. 47-51; Industry Br. \n51-54) that the disapproval action falls outside Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong because the States\u2019 plan sub-\nmissions and EPA\u2019s analysis had State-specific aspects.  \nBut the State-specific analyses petitioners highlight \nlargely reflect the application of the nationwide deter-\nminations to each State\u2019s circumstances.  For example, \npetitioners note (State Br. 48; Industry Br. 51) Utah\u2019s \nargument during the administrative proceedings that it \nneed not reduce its contributions to Colorado-based re-\nceptors because its contribution was minimal in compar-\nison to those of other emissions sources.  But EPA re-\njected that argument\u2014made by numerous other States \n\u2014based on EPA\u2019s nationwide determination that the \nrelative magnitude of contributions from other sources \ndoes not relieve States of their Good Neighbor obliga-\ntions.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9378-9379.  Similarly, petitioners \nemphasize (State Br. 47; Industry Br. 52) Oklahoma\u2019s \nargument that existing emission-reduction measures \nwere sufficient to meet its Good Neighbor obligations.  \nBut again, many other States made the same argument, \nand EPA concluded that no linked State could meet its \nGood Neighbor obligations simply by relying on exist-\ning control measures or anticipated reductions that are \nnot incorporated into enforceable state plans.  See 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9343, 9377.   \nIn treating EPA\u2019s need to consider State-specific cir-\ncumstances as controlling the venue inquiry, petitioners \n\n45 \n \nwould effectively limit D.C. Circuit venue under Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong to review of EPA actions that \nare based solely on determinations of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Nothing in the statutory text supports that \napproach.  Where Congress intended to require such a \nlimitation, it said so explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (providing an exception to the statute\u2019s 60-\nday filing window where the \u201cpetition is based solely on \ngrounds arising after\u201d that time period expires) (em-\nphasis added); cf. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in \nother statutes, [Congress] could have added \u2018solely\u2019 to \nindicate that actions taken \u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence \nof multiple factors do not violate the law.\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nOnce again, petitioners\u2019 approach would render the \n\u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d prong practically insignifi-\ncant and is inconsistent with the statutory history.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  By its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong applies only to actions that are \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can \nbe expected to rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Yet on petitioners\u2019 \nview, EPA\u2019s consideration of such circumstances is suf-\nficient to preclude D.C. Circuit review.  And as ex-\nplained above (see pp. 38-41, supra), Congress enacted \nSection 7607(b)(1) in its current form after then- \nGeneral Counsel Frick specifically highlighted the fact \nthat EPA\u2019s approval of plans for individual States\u2014\nwhich necessarily rest at least in part on State-specific \ncircumstances\u2014can also raise issues of national signifi-\ncance for which D.C. Circuit review is appropriate.  See \n41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  Petitioners\u2019 interpretation thus \ncontravenes Congress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review \nof national issues in the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing ef-\n\n46 \n \nficient resolution of those issues, even when the actions \nalso address local or regional concerns.   \nc. Petitioners contend (State Br. 54; Industry Br. \n55) that adopting EPA\u2019s interpretation would allow \nD.C. Circuit venue for challenges to every locally or re-\ngionally applicable EPA action.  That is incorrect.  The \nstatutory text includes significant limitations that pre-\nvent that result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 31-32, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 33, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already explained, \nibid., that causation requirement is satisfied here\u2014but \nit will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \n\n47 \n \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments  \nreflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the nation-\nwide rule, policy, or interpretation itself is likely to be \ncalled into question in any judicial challenge to the EPA \naction, routing such challenges to the D.C. Circuit \nserves important interests in judicial efficiency and na-\ntionwide uniformity.  That is particularly so if the rele-\nvant EPA determination is intended to govern future \nagency actions across the country.  But where the valid-\nity of the general rule or policy appears to be settled, \nsuch that any judicial challenges to the action are likely \nto focus on the application of the general pronounce-\nment to discrete local facts, those interests are inappo-\nsite. \nHere, EPA made each of the relevant determinations \nin the disapproval action itself, after considering com-\nments disputing their validity.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at \n9365-9367, 9370-9375, 9376-9378.  While the determina-\ntions may be consistent with EPA\u2019s prior implementa-\ntion of other NAAQS, EPA did not simply apply exist-\ning rules or standards; rather, its determinations re-\nsolved controversies over specific methodological issues \nthat were vigorously contested.  EPA\u2019s conclusions sup-\nporting the disapproval action therefore are properly \n\n48 \n \nviewed as \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d within the meaning of Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1).   \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \npp. 33-34, supra.  For example, EPA may consider \nwhether any petitions for review of a particular action \nwould likely contest EPA determinations of national \nconcern, or instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s under-\nstanding of local or regional circumstances.  For EPA \nactions in the latter category, the agency may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action.   \nd. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that are subject to D.C. Circuit review, while al-\nlowing efficient and uniform resolution of disputed is-\nsues of national significance.  By contrast, petitioners\u2019 \ninterpretation would limit D.C. Circuit review of locally \nor regionally applicable EPA actions to a vanishingly \nsmall category.  Embracing petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nwould lead to the very problems Congress sought to \navoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue provision to include \nthe nationwide-scope-or-effect language.   \nThis case is illustrative.  Because multiple circuits \nhave declined to transfer challenges to the D.C. Circuit, \n\n49 \n \nEPA has been litigating substantially similar challenges \nto the disapproval action in eight courts of appeals.  Ra-\nther than focusing their challenges on State-specific \nfindings that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval of par-\nticular state plans, the petitioners in all of those cases \nhave primarily contested the legality of the same core \ndeterminations that EPA adopted and applied nation-\nwide.   \nConsideration of the same basic legal challenges by \nmultiple circuits wastes judicial resources and creates a \nsubstantial risk of inconsistent merits rulings.  Such \nrulings would produce a fragmented Good Neighbor \nprogram for ozone, subjecting similarly situated States \nto different regulatory burdens based on the circuits in \nwhich those States are located, and complicating EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of the \u201coverlapping and interwoven link-\nages between upwind and downwind States\u201d that char-\nacterize the ozone problem.  EPA v. EME Homer City \nGeneration, L. P., 572 U.S. 489, 496-497 (2014).  Such a \nresult is contrary to the principles animating the Good \nNeighbor Provision, and to Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose \nof ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of issues with \nnational significance.  If this Court endorses petition-\ners\u2019 venue analysis, future EPA actions similar to the \ndisapproval action here can be expected to spawn litiga-\ntion in numerous courts of appeals, with a consequent \nwaste of judicial resources and a heightened risk of in-\nconsistent outcomes.  Nothing in the statutory text re-\nquires that result, and the Court should reject it. \n \n \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe order of the court of appeals should be affirmed.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nJEANHEE HONG \nROSEMARY H.

Air \nquality criteria for an air pollutant shall accurately re-\nflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating \nthe kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public \nhealth or welfare which may be expected from the pres-\nence of such pollutant in the ambient air, in varying \nquantities.  The criteria for an air pollutant, to the ex-\ntent practicable, shall include information on\u2014 \n\n2a \n \n \n(A) \nthose variable factors (including atmos-\npheric conditions) which of themselves or in combina-\ntion with other factors may alter the effects on public \nhealth or welfare of such air pollutant; \n \n(B) \nthe types of air pollutants which, when pre-\nsent in the atmosphere, may interact with such pollu-\ntant to produce an adverse effect on public health or \nwelfare; and \n \n(C) \nany known or anticipated adverse effects on \nwelfare. \n(b) \nIssuance by Administrator of information on air pol-\nlution control techniques; standing consulting com-\nmittees for air pollutants; establishment; member-\nship \n(1) Simultaneously with the issuance of criteria un-\nder subsection (a), the Administrator shall, after consul-\ntation with appropriate advisory committees and Fed-\neral departments and agencies, issue to the States and \nappropriate air pollution control agencies information \non air pollution control techniques, which information \nshall include data relating to the cost of installation and \noperation, energy requirements, emission reduction \nbenefits, and environmental impact of the emission con-\ntrol technology.  Such information shall include such \ndata as are available on available technology and alter-\nnative methods of prevention and control of air pollu-\ntion.  Such information shall also include data on alter-\nnative fuels, processes, and operating methods which \nwill result in elimination or significant reduction of emis-\nsions. \n(2) In order to assist in the development of infor-\nmation on pollution control techniques, the Administra-\n\n3a \n \ntor may establish a standing consulting committee for \neach air pollutant included in a list published pursuant \nto subsection (a)(1), which shall be comprised of techni-\ncally qualified individuals representative of State and lo-\ncal governments, industry, and the academic commu-\nnity.  Each such committee shall submit, as appropri-\nate, to the Administrator information related to that re-\nquired by paragraph (1). \n(c) \nReview, modification, and reissuance of criteria or \ninformation \nThe Administrator shall from time to time review, \nand, as appropriate, modify, and reissue any criteria or \ninformation on control techniques issued pursuant to \nthis section.  Not later than six months after August 7, \n1977, the Administrator shall revise and reissue criteria \nrelating to concentrations of NO2 over such period (not \nmore than three hours) as he deems appropriate.  Such \ncriteria shall include a discussion of nitric and nitrous \nacids, nitrites, nitrates, nitrosamines, and other carcino-\ngenic and potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides \nof nitrogen. \n(d) \nPublication in Federal Register; availability of cop-\nies for general public \nThe issuance of air quality criteria and information \non air pollution control techniques shall be announced in \nthe Federal Register and copies shall be made available \nto the general public. \n(e) \nTransportation planning and guidelines \nThe Administrator shall, after consultation with the \nSecretary of Transportation, and after providing public \nnotice and opportunity for comment, and with State and \nlocal officials, within nine months after November 15, \n\n4a \n \n1990,1 and periodically thereafter as necessary to main-\ntain a continuous transportation-air quality planning \nprocess, update the June 1978 Transportation-Air Qual-\nity Planning Guidelines and publish guidance on the de-\nvelopment and implementation of transportation and \nother measures necessary to demonstrate and maintain \nattainment of national ambient air quality standards.  \nSuch guidelines shall include information on\u2014 \n \n(1) \nmethods to identify and evaluate alternative \nplanning and control activities; \n \n(2) \nmethods of reviewing plans on a regular ba-\nsis as conditions change or new information is pre-\nsented; \n \n(3) \nidentification of funds and other resources \nnecessary to implement the plan, including inter-\nagency agreements on providing such funds and re-\nsources; \n \n(4) \nmethods to assure participation by the pub-\nlic in all phases of the planning process; and \n \n(5) \nsuch other methods as the Administrator \ndetermines necessary to carry out a continuous plan-\nning process. \n(f\u200a) \nInformation regarding processes, procedures, and \nmethods to reduce or control pollutants in transpor-\ntation; reduction of mobile source related pollu-\ntants; reduction of impact on public health \n(1) The Administrator shall publish and make avail-\nable to appropriate Federal, State, and local environ-\nmental and transportation agencies not later than one \n \n1  See Codification note below. \n\n5a \n \nyear after November 15, 1990, and from time to time \nthereafter\u2014 \n \n(A) \ninformation prepared, as appropriate, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Transportation, \nand after providing public notice and opportunity for \ncomment, regarding the formulation and emission re-\nduction potential of transportation control measures \nrelated to criteria pollutants and their precursors, in-\ncluding, but not limited to\u2014 \n \n \n(i) \nprograms for improved public transit; \n \n(ii) \nrestriction of certain roads or lanes to, or \nconstruction of such roads or lanes for use by, pas-\nsenger buses or high occupancy vehicles; \n \n(iii) employer-based transportation manage-\nment plans, including incentives; \n \n(iv) trip-reduction ordinances; \n \n(v) \ntraffic flow improvement programs that \nachieve emission reductions; \n \n(vi) fringe and transportation corridor park-\ning facilities serving multiple occupancy vehicle \nprograms or transit service; \n \n(vii) programs to limit or restrict vehicle use \nin downtown areas or other areas of emission con-\ncentration particularly during periods of peak use; \n \n(viii) programs for the provision of all forms of \nhigh-occupancy, shared-ride services; \n \n(ix) programs to limit portions of road sur-\nfaces or certain sections of the metropolitan area \nto the use of non-motorized vehicles or pedestrian \nuse, both as to time and place; \n\n6a \n \n \n(x) \nprograms for secure bicycle storage facil-\nities and other facilities, including bicycle lanes, \nfor the convenience and protection of bicyclists, in \nboth public and private areas; \n \n(xi) programs to control extended idling of ve-\nhicles; \n \n(xii) programs to reduce motor vehicle emis-\nsions, consistent with subchapter II, which are \ncaused by extreme cold start conditions; \n \n(xiii) employer-sponsored programs to permit \nflexible work schedules; \n \n(xiv) programs and ordinances to facilitate \nnon-automobile travel, provision and utilization of \nmass transit, and to generally reduce the need for \nsingle-occupant vehicle travel, as part of transpor-\ntation planning and development efforts of a local-\nity, including programs and ordinances applicable \nto new shopping centers, special events, and other \ncenters of vehicle activity; \n \n(xv) programs for new construction and major \nreconstructions of paths, tracks or areas solely for \nthe use by pedestrian or other non-motorized \nmeans of transportation when economically feasi-\nble and in the public interest.  For purposes of \nthis clause, the Administrator shall also consult \nwith the Secretary of the Interior; and \n \n(xvi) program to encourage the voluntary re-\nmoval from use and the marketplace of pre-1980 \n\n7a \n \nmodel year light duty vehicles and pre-1980 model \nlight duty trucks.2  \n \n(B) \ninformation on additional methods or strat-\negies that will contribute to the reduction of mobile \nsource related pollutants during periods in which any \nprimary ambient air quality standard will be ex-\nceeded and during episodes for which an air pollution \nalert, warning, or emergency has been declared; \n \n(C) \ninformation on other measures which may \nbe employed to reduce the impact on public health or \nprotect the health of sensitive or susceptible individ-\nuals or groups; and \n \n(D) \ninformation on the extent to which any pro-\ncess, procedure, or method to reduce or control such \nair pollutant may cause an increase in the emissions \nor formation of any other pollutant. \n(2) In publishing such information the Administra-\ntor shall also include an assessment of\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe relative effectiveness of such processes, \nprocedures, and methods; \n \n(B) \nthe potential effect of such processes, proce-\ndures, and methods on transportation systems and \nthe provision of transportation services; and \n \n(C) \nthe environmental, energy, and economic \nimpact of such processes, procedures, and methods. \n(g) \nAssessment of risks to ecosystems \nThe Administrator may assess the risks to ecosys-\ntems from exposure to criteria air pollutants (as identi-\n \n2  So in original.  The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n8a \n \nfied by the Administrator in the Administrator\u2019s sole \ndiscretion). \n(h) RACT/BACT/LAER clearinghouse \nThe Administrator shall make information regarding \nemission control technology available to the States and \nto the general public through a central database.  Such \ninformation shall include all control technology infor-\nmation received pursuant to State plan provisions re-\nquiring permits for sources, including operating permits \nfor existing sources. \n \n2. \n42 U.S.C. 7409 provides: \nNational primary and secondary ambient air quality \nstandards \n(a) \nPromulgation \n(1) The Administrator\u2014 \n \n(A) \nwithin 30 days after December 31, 1970, \nshall publish proposed regulations prescribing a na-\ntional primary ambient air quality standard and a na-\ntional secondary ambient air quality standard for \neach air pollutant for which air quality criteria have \nbeen issued prior to such date; and \n \n(B) \nafter a reasonable time for interested per-\nsons to submit written comments thereon (but no \nlater than 90 days after the initial publication of such \nproposed standards) shall by regulation promulgate \nsuch proposed national primary and secondary ambi-\nent air quality standards with such modifications as \nhe deems appropriate. \n\n9a \n \n(2) With respect to any air pollutant for which air \nquality criteria are issued after December 31, 1970, the \nAdministrator shall publish, simultaneously with the is-\nsuance of such criteria and information, proposed na-\ntional primary and secondary ambient air quality stand-\nards for any such pollutant.  The procedure provided \nfor in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall apply to \nthe promulgation of such standards. \n(b) \nProtection of public health and welfare \n(1) National primary ambient air quality standards, \nprescribed under subsection (a) shall be ambient air \nquality standards the attainment and maintenance of \nwhich in the judgment of the Administrator, based on \nsuch criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, \nare requisite to protect the public health.  Such pri-\nmary standards may be revised in the same manner as \npromulgated. \n(2) Any national secondary ambient air quality \nstandard prescribed under subsection (a) shall specify a \nlevel of air quality the attainment and maintenance of \nwhich in the judgment of the Administrator, based on \nsuch criteria, is requisite to protect the public welfare \nfrom any known or anticipated adverse effects associ-\nated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambi-\nent air.  Such secondary standards may be revised in \nthe same manner as promulgated. \n(c) \nNational primary ambient air quality standard for \nnitrogen dioxide \nThe Administrator shall, not later than one year after \nAugust 7, 1977, promulgate a national primary ambient \nair quality standard for NO2 concentrations over a pe-\nriod of not more than 3 hours unless, based on the crite-\n\n10a \n \nria issued under section 7408(c) of this title, he finds \nthat there is no significant evidence that such a standard \nfor such a period is requisite to protect public health. \n(d) \nReview and revision of criteria and standards; inde-\npendent scientific review committee; appointment; \nadvisory functions \n(1) Not later than December 31, 1980, and at five-\nyear intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall com-\nplete a thorough review of the criteria published un-\nder section 7408 of this title and the national ambient \nair quality standards promulgated under this section \nand shall make such revisions in such criteria and stand-\nards and promulgate such new standards as may be ap-\npropriate in accordance with section 7408 of this ti-\ntle and subsection (b) of this section.  The Administra-\ntor may review and revise criteria or promulgate new \nstandards earlier or more frequently than required un-\nder this paragraph. \n(2)(A)  The Administrator shall appoint an inde-\npendent scientific review committee composed of seven \nmembers including at least one member of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, one physician, and one person rep-\nresenting State air pollution control agencies. \n(B) Not later than January 1, 1980, and at five-year \nintervals thereafter, the committee referred to in sub-\nparagraph (A) shall complete a review of the criteria \npublished under section 7408 of this title and the na-\ntional primary and secondary ambient air quality stand-\nards promulgated under this section and shall recom-\nmend to the Administrator any new national ambient air \nquality standards and revisions of existing criteria and \n\n11a \n \nstandards as may be appropriate under section 7408 of \nthis title and subsection (b) of this section. \n(C) Such committee shall also (i) advise the Admin-\nistrator of areas in which additional knowledge is re-\nquired to appraise the adequacy and basis of existing, \nnew, or revised national ambient air quality standards, \n(ii) describe the research efforts necessary to provide \nthe required information, (iii) advise the Administrator \non the relative contribution to air pollution concentra-\ntions of natural as well as anthropogenic activity, and \n(iv) advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, \nwelfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may re-\nsult from various strategies for attainment and mainte-\nnance of such national ambient air quality standards. \n \n3. \n42 U.S.C. 7410 provides: \nState implementation plans for national primary and sec-\nondary ambient air quality standards \n(a) \nAdoption of plan by State; submission to Adminis-\ntrator; content of plan; revision; new sources; indi-\nrect source review program; supplemental or inter-\nmittent control systems \n(1) Each State shall, after reasonable notice and \npublic hearings, adopt and submit to the Administrator, \nwithin 3 years (or such shorter period as the Adminis-\ntrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a na-\ntional primary ambient air quality standard (or any re-\nvision thereof\u200a) under section 7409 of this title for any \nair pollutant, a plan which provides for implementation, \nmaintenance, and enforcement of such primary stand-\nard in each air quality control region (or portion thereof\u200a) \nwithin such State.

The \nAdministrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if \nthe revision would interfere with any applicable require-\nment concerning attainment and reasonable further \nprogress (as defined in section 7501 of this title), or any \nother applicable requirement of this chapter. \n(m) Sanctions \nThe Administrator may apply any of the sanctions \nlisted in section 7509(b) of this title at any time (or at \nany time after) the Administrator makes a finding, dis-\napproval, or determination under paragraphs (1) through \n(4), respectively, of section 7509(a) of this title in rela-\ntion to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by \nthe Administrator) required under this chapter, with re-\n\n32a \n \nspect to any portion of the State the Administrator de-\ntermines reasonable and appropriate, for the purpose of \nensuring that the requirements of this chapter relating \nto such plan or plan item are met.  The Administrator \nshall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his au-\nthority under the previous sentence with respect to any \ndeficiency referred to in section 7509(a) of this title to \nensure that, during the 24-month period following the \nfinding, disapproval, or determination referred to \nin section 7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not ap-\nplied on a statewide basis where one or more political \nsubdivisions covered by the applicable implementation \nplan are principally responsible for such deficiency. \n(n) Savings clauses \n(1) Existing plan provisions \n \nAny provision of any applicable implementation \nplan that was approved or promulgated by the Ad-\nministrator pursuant to this section as in effect be-\nfore November 15, 1990, shall remain in effect as part \nof such applicable implementation plan, except to the \nextent that a revision to such provision is approved \nor promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to \nthis chapter. \n(2) Attainment dates \n \nFor any area not designated nonattainment, any \nplan or plan revision submitted or required to be sub-\nmitted by a State\u2014 \n \n(A) \nin response to the promulgation or revi-\nsion of a national primary ambient air quality \nstandard in effect on November 15, 1990, or \n\n33a \n \n \n(B) \nin response to a finding of substantial in-\nadequacy under subsection (a)(2) (as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990), \nshall provide for attainment of the national primary \nambient air quality standards within 3 years of No-\nvember 15, 1990, or within 5 years of issuance of such \nfinding of substantial inadequacy, whichever is later. \n(3) Retention of construction moratorium in certain \nareas \n \nIn the case of an area to which, immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990, the prohibition on construction \nor modification of major stationary sources prescribed \nin subsection (a)(2)(I) (as in effect immediately be-\nfore November 15, 1990) applied by virtue of a find-\ning of the Administrator that the State containing \nsuch area had not submitted an implementation plan \nmeeting the requirements of section 7502(b)(6) of \nthis title (relating to establishment of a permit pro-\ngram) (as in effect immediately before November 15, \n1990) or 7502(a)(1) of this title (to the extent such re-\nquirements relate to provision for attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990, no major sta-\ntionary source of the relevant air pollutant or pollu-\ntants shall be constructed or modified in such area \nuntil the Administrator finds that the plan for such \narea meets the applicable requirements of section \n7502(c)(5) of this title (relating to permit programs) \nor subpart 5 of part D (relating to attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur dioxide), respectively. \n\n34a \n \n(o) \nIndian tribes \nIf an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to \nthe Administrator pursuant to section 7601(d) of this ti-\ntle, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the \nprovisions for review set forth in this section for State \nplans, except as otherwise provided by regulation prom-\nulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this title.  \nWhen such plan becomes effective in accordance with \nthe regulations promulgated under section 7601(d) of \nthis title, the plan shall become applicable to all areas \n(except as expressly provided otherwise in the plan) lo-\ncated within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, \nnotwithstanding the issuance of any patent and includ-\ning rights-of-way running through the reservation. \n(p) \nReports \nAny State shall submit, according to such schedule as \nthe Administrator may prescribe, such reports as the \nAdministrator may require relating to emission reduc-\ntions, vehicle miles traveled, congestion levels, and any \nother information the Administrator may deem neces-\nsary to assess the development4 effectiveness, need for \nrevision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision \nrequired under this chapter. \n \n4. 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) provides: \nAdministrative proceedings and judicial review \n(b) \nJudicial review \n(1) A petition for review of action of the Administra-\ntor in promulgating any national primary or secondary \n \n4  So in original.

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the Petitioners' Reply Brief has resolved the primary uncertainty identified in my previous belief state. This document provides direct counter-arguments to the EPA's position, filling a significant analytical gap and substantially strengthening my understanding of the petitioners' case.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, Significantly Bolstered):** My belief in the petitioners' textualist argument remains firm and is now significantly reinforced. The reply brief confirms their focus is on defining the \"action\" as the individual, state-specific disapproval of a plan, not the consolidated Federal Register notice. Crucially, the brief adds a powerful new textual point: \u00a7 7607(b)(1) explicitly lists \"any denial or disapproval\" of a state implementation plan as a \"prototypical 'local or regionally applicable' action\" subject to regional circuit review. This directly weaponizes the statute's text against the EPA's \"bundling\" strategy.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Weakened, with Rebuttals Now Specified):** My previous assessment that the EPA's arguments were weak is now supported by specific, direct rebuttals from the petitioners.\n    *   **Prong 1: \"Nationally Applicable\" (Significantly Weakened):** The petitioners directly attack the EPA's conflation of the \"action\" with the \"notice of such...action,\" a distinction made in the statute itself. They argue that if using a \"common analytical method\" across several states rendered the action \"national,\" then virtually any grouped set of local actions would lose its local character, effectively nullifying the regional review provision.\n    *   **Prong 2: \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (Significantly Weakened):** The petitioners argue that this savings clause requires an \"independent assessment\" by the court, citing *Texas v. EPA* (5th Cir. 2016). They contend the \"core determinations\" for disapproval were state-specific (e.g., Oklahoma's failure to analyze in-state sources, Utah's flawed arguments about specific Colorado receptors), not the \"peripheral\" national framework. They also rebut the idea that cross-border pollution creates a \"nationwide effect\" by citing *New York v. EPA* (7th Cir. 1998), which noted that this logic would swallow the rule entirely, since \"air currents do not respect state boundaries.\"\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable, Sharpened):** The dispute remains centered on statutory interpretation, but the lines are now clearer. The core question is whether the dispositive legal \"action\" is the EPA's procedural choice to publish decisions together, or the substance of the individual, state-specific disapprovals. The petitioners frame this as a choice between form (the Federal Register notice) and substance (the actual basis for disapproving each state's plan).\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Tipped Further in Petitioners' Favor):** My belief that petitioners have the upper hand here is stronger. They now wield two distinct surplusage arguments: (1) The EPA's \"bundling\" theory of what constitutes a \"nationally applicable\" action would render the regional review provision for SIPs meaningless. (2) The EPA's \"cross-border pollution\" theory for what constitutes a \"nationwide...effect\" would similarly swallow the general rule of regional review for most major air quality actions.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" (Stable, Reinforced):** This theme remains central. The reply brief explicitly argues that the EPA's interpretation grants it \"total power to manipulate venue,\" citing *Hertz Corp. v. Friend* for the principle that rules should not \"encourage gamesmanship.\" This argument appears tailored to the current Court's skepticism of unchecked agency discretion.\n\n6.  **Strategic Importance of \"Neither Party\" Stance (Stable):** This belief about the Chamber of Commerce's amicus brief is unchanged and serves as background context.\n\n7.  **Evidentiary Imbalance and Uncertainty (Largely Resolved):** My previous primary belief update, which acknowledged a significant blind spot due to the lack of EPA-aligned arguments, has now been directly addressed. The petitioners' reply brief outlines the EPA's arguments and provides specific, text- and precedent-based rebuttals. While I have not read the EPA's brief in its entirety, the petitioners' characterization and refutation of it significantly reduce my uncertainty. The EPA's case appears to rest on deference to its own procedural choices and its own declaration of nationwide effect\u2014positions that the petitioners have strongly attacked using textualism, precedent, and arguments against agency self-aggrandizement. My confidence in a likely ruling for the petitioners has substantially increased. The remaining uncertainty pertains to whether the EPA's own brief contains a novel or more compelling argument than the one dismantled by the petitioners.",

This structuring of the problem space is a valuable form of information gain that directly enables a more targeted and effective subsequent action.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action demonstrates a highly effective and generalizable strategy for legal analysis. The pattern of 'Initial Brief -> Belief -> Opposing Brief -> Belief Update -> THINK to Re-evaluate and Plan' is a cornerstone of BOED in an adversarial context.

Recognizing the value of this strategic pause is a key insight for improving the overall design of the prediction agent.\n\nJoint EIG (1.2): The action is valuable because it makes the entire process more efficient.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The receipt and analysis of the Brief for the Federal Respondents (the EPA) has resolved the final major uncertainty in my model: the precise nature and strength of the government's arguments. My previous beliefs, formed primarily from the petitioners' filings, correctly identified the statutory prongs at issue but underestimated the sophistication of the EPA's position. My confidence in a victory for the petitioners has been substantially moderated, as the case now appears to be a much closer contest of competing statutory interpretations.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, but Now Directly Contested):** My belief in the strength of the petitioners' textualist argument\u2014that the \"action\" is the individual state plan disapproval and that \"any denial or disapproval\" is listed as a prototypically local action\u2014remains. However, it is no longer an unopposed point. The EPA directly counters this by arguing that the \"final action\" is the *single, consolidated rulemaking* that disapproved 21 plans. They contend that an agency's legitimate procedural choice to aggregate related matters into a single rule creates a single, nationally applicable action, a position they support by citing broad principles of agency procedural discretion (*Vermont Yankee*, *FCC v. Pottsville*).\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Upgraded from \"Weakened\" to \"Strong and Plausible\"):** My previous assessment, based on the petitioners' reply brief, is now revised. The EPA's arguments are robust.\n    *   **Prong 1: \"Nationally Applicable\" (Moderately Strong):** The EPA's argument here is stronger than anticipated. It hinges on defining the \"action\" as the entire rulemaking document published in the Federal Register. They argue this single rule, disapproving plans in 21 states using a uniform legal and analytical approach, is inherently \"nationally applicable.\" This transforms the debate from one about the *effect* of Oklahoma's plan to one about the *form and scope* of the agency's chosen procedural vehicle.\n    *   **Prong 2: \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (Very Strong):** This appears to be the EPA's most compelling argument. They masterfully shift the focus from the *effect* of the action to the *basis* of the action. They argue the disapprovals are \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\" because they flow directly from a \"common core of nationwide policy judgments and technical analysis.\" This \"determination\" includes the nationwide air quality modeling, the uniform 1% contribution threshold, and the consistent legal rejection of arguments about relative contributions from other states or countries. Citing a broad reading of \"based on\" (*Bostock*), they contend these nationwide analytical choices were the but-for cause of the disapprovals, thus triggering the savings clause for D.C. Circuit review.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Sharpened into a Two-Level Conflict):** The dispute remains centered on statutory interpretation, but it is now clearer that it operates on two levels:\n    *   **Level 1 (Prong 1):** What constitutes the \"final action\"? Is it the substantive disapproval of a single state's plan, or is it the procedural vehicle of a single, multi-state rulemaking?\n    *   **Level 2 (Prong 2):** What constitutes the \"determination\"? Is it the ultimate decision regarding one state's compliance, or is it the underlying, uniform analytical framework applied to all states?\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Now a Stalemate):** My prior belief that petitioners had the upper hand here is incorrect. The EPA has mounted a powerful counter-attack. While petitioners argue the EPA's \"bundling\" theory renders regional review meaningless, the EPA retorts that the petitioners' narrow reading of the \"nationwide scope or effect\" clause would render *that* provision \"practically insignificant.\" The EPA argues the savings clause was designed for precisely this scenario\u2014a series of local actions linked by a common, nationwide analytical basis\u2014and that if it doesn't apply here, it's hard to imagine when it ever would. The Court is now faced with two competing claims that the other side's interpretation nullifies part of the statute.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Now a Competing Narrative):** The petitioners' theme of agency forum-shopping is now directly countered by the EPA's narrative of administrative necessity. The EPA frames its approach not as \"gamesmanship\" but as a necessary tool to ensure \"national consistency,\" \"equitable results\" among upwind and downwind states, and administrative efficiency. They argue that addressing a collective, interstate pollution problem requires a collective, interstate solution, and that piecemeal review in regional circuits would risk inconsistent and inequitable outcomes. This practical argument about good governance provides a strong rebuttal to the petitioners' more cynical framing.\n\n6.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Significantly Moderated):** The primary uncertainty from my previous belief state has been fully resolved. The EPA's brief is not only competent but compelling, particularly on the \"nationwide scope or effect\" prong. My confidence in a ruling for the petitioners has decreased substantially. The case is no longer a straightforward application of a statutory list but a complex puzzle of how to harmonize three distinct clauses in \u00a7 7607(b)(1). The EPA's argument on the savings clause provides the Court a clear, text-based path to affirm the Tenth Circuit without having to broadly define \"nationally applicable.\" The outcome is now highly uncertain and will depend on which side's view of the statutory structure the Court finds more persuasive.",

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been progressively refined by analyzing the primary briefs from both parties. The receipt of the federal respondent's brief significantly altered my initial assessment, and this latest internal review serves to crystallize my current epistemic state and identify the most critical remaining uncertainties.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable, but Now Directly Contested):** My belief in the strength of the petitioners' textualist argument\u2014that the \"action\" is the individual state plan disapproval and that \"any denial or disapproval\" is listed as a prototypically local action\u2014remains. However, it is no longer an unopposed point. The EPA directly counters this by arguing that the \"final action\" is the *single, consolidated rulemaking* that disapproved 21 plans. They contend that an agency's legitimate procedural choice to aggregate related matters into a single rule creates a single, nationally applicable action, a position they support by citing broad principles of agency procedural discretion (*Vermont Yankee*, *FCC v. Pottsville*).\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Upgraded from \"Weakened\" to \"Strong and Plausible\"):** My previous assessment, based on the petitioners' reply brief, is now revised. The EPA's arguments are robust.\n    *   **Prong 1: \"Nationally Applicable\" (Moderately Strong):** The EPA's argument here is stronger than anticipated. It hinges on defining the \"action\" as the entire rulemaking document published in the Federal Register. They argue this single rule, disapproving plans in 21 states using a uniform legal and analytical approach, is inherently \"nationally applicable.\" This transforms the debate from one about the *effect* of Oklahoma's plan to one about the *form and scope* of the agency's chosen procedural vehicle.\n    *   **Prong 2: \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (Very Strong):** This appears to be the EPA's most compelling argument. They masterfully shift the focus from the *effect* of the action to the *basis* of the action. They argue the disapprovals are \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\" because they flow directly from a \"common core of nationwide policy judgments and technical analysis.\" This \"determination\" includes the nationwide air quality modeling, the uniform 1% contribution threshold, and the consistent legal rejection of arguments about relative contributions from other states or countries. Citing a broad reading of \"based on\" (*Bostock*), they contend these nationwide analytical choices were the but-for cause of the disapprovals, thus triggering the savings clause for D.C. Circuit review.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Sharpened into a Two-Level Conflict):** The dispute remains centered on statutory interpretation, but it is now clearer that it operates on two levels:\n    *   **Level 1 (Prong 1):** What constitutes the \"final action\"? Is it the substantive disapproval of a single state's plan, or is it the procedural vehicle of a single, multi-state rulemaking?\n    *   **Level 2 (Prong 2):** What constitutes the \"determination\"? Is it the ultimate decision regarding one state's compliance, or is it the underlying, uniform analytical framework applied to all states?\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Now a Stalemate):** My prior belief that petitioners had the upper hand here is incorrect. The EPA has mounted a powerful counter-attack. While petitioners argue the EPA's \"bundling\" theory renders regional review meaningless, the EPA retorts that the petitioners' narrow reading of the \"nationwide scope or effect\" clause would render *that* provision \"practically insignificant.\" The EPA argues the savings clause was designed for precisely this scenario\u2014a series of local actions linked by a common, nationwide analytical basis\u2014and that if it doesn't apply here, it's hard to imagine when it ever would. The Court is now faced with two competing claims that the other side's interpretation nullifies part of the statute.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Now a Competing Narrative):** The petitioners' theme of agency forum-shopping is now directly countered by the EPA's narrative of administrative necessity. The EPA frames its approach not as \"gamesmanship\" but as a necessary tool to ensure \"national consistency,\" \"equitable results\" among upwind and downwind states, and administrative efficiency. They argue that addressing a collective, interstate pollution problem requires a collective, interstate solution, and that piecemeal review in regional circuits would risk inconsistent and inequitable outcomes. This practical argument about good governance provides a strong rebuttal to the petitioners' more cynical framing.\n\n6.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Significantly Moderated):** The primary uncertainty from my previous belief state has been fully resolved. The EPA's brief is not only competent but compelling, particularly on the \"nationwide scope or effect\" prong. My confidence in a ruling for the petitioners has decreased substantially. The case is no longer a straightforward application of a statutory list but a complex puzzle of how to harmonize three distinct clauses in \u00a7 7607(b)(1). The EPA's argument on the savings clause provides the Court a clear, text-based path to affirm the Tenth Circuit without having to broadly define \"nationally applicable.\" The outcome is now highly uncertain and will depend on which side's view of the statutory structure the Court finds more persuasive.\n\n7.  **Epistemic State and Key Remaining Uncertainties (New Synthesis):** The latest observation, an internal reasoning step, provides no new external evidence but serves to formalize my current state of knowledge. The analysis of the primary briefs is now complete. My model of the case has shifted from a likely petitioner victory to a true toss-up. The pivotal legal question has been identified: the interpretation of the savings clause, specifically whether the EPA's disapprovals are \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\" The EPA's argument on this point is the strongest in the case. Consequently, the single most valuable piece of information to acquire next is the **Petitioners' Reply Brief**, as it will contain their direct rebuttal to this powerful argument. A secondary uncertainty is the content of amicus briefs, particularly any from downwind states that might bolster the EPA's \"national consistency\" narrative. My information-gathering strategy is now focused on acquiring the reply brief to resolve this primary uncertainty.",

The receipt of the federal respondent's brief significantly altered my initial assessment, and the subsequent analysis of the petitioners' reply brief has resolved my primary uncertainty and shifted my prediction.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Strengthened):** My belief in the strength of the petitioners' textualist argument\u2014that the \"action\" is the individual state plan disapproval and that \"any denial or disapproval\" is listed as a prototypically local action\u2014is now bolstered. The reply brief effectively counters the EPA's \"bundling\" theory by labeling it a \"form-over-substance\" reading that grants the agency unchecked power to manipulate venue. Petitioners strengthen this by pointing out the statute's own distinction between the \"action\" and the \"notice of such... action,\" suggesting publication format cannot be dispositive.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Weakened):** My previous assessment that the EPA's arguments were \"strong and plausible\" is now revised downward after seeing the petitioners' rebuttal.\n    *   **Prong 1: \"Nationally Applicable\" (Moderately Strong, but Effectively Countered):** The EPA's argument that bundling local actions into one rule makes the rule \"nationally applicable\" remains a plausible structural argument. However, the petitioners' reply brief effectively exposes its weakness: if applying a uniform national standard or interpretation were the test, nearly every Clean Air Act action would become \"nationally applicable,\" rendering the distinction for regional review meaningless.\n    *   **Prong 2: \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\" (Significantly Weakened):** This argument, which I previously saw as the EPA's strongest, has been substantially undermined. The petitioners' reply brief introduces a critical counter-argument, citing the Fifth Circuit's test in *Texas v. EPA* (829 F.3d 405): the action must be based on a *core determination*, not a \"peripheral or extraneous\" one. They argue the EPA's \"common core of nationwide policy judgments and technical analysis\" cannot be the *core determination* because the EPA used the exact same framework and modeling to *approve* other states' plans. The dispositive factor, they contend, was the state-specific analysis of each plan's individual flaws (e.g., Oklahoma's failure to analyze in-state sources, Utah's specific arguments about Colorado receptors). This factual rebuttal directly challenges the EPA's claim that its nationwide analysis was the \"but-for\" cause of the disapprovals.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Refined):** The conflict remains a two-level statutory interpretation puzzle, but the second level is now much clearer.\n    *   **Level 1 (Prong 1):** What constitutes the \"final action\"? (Stable: single state disapproval vs. single multi-state rulemaking).\n    *   **Level 2 (Prong 2):** What does it mean for an action to be \"*based on* a determination\"? The petitioners have successfully framed this as a choice between the EPA's broad \"but-for cause\" test (any nationwide analysis that is part of the causal chain) and their own narrower \"core determination\" test (the dispositive reason for the specific outcome).\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Petitioners Gain the Upper Hand):** The previous stalemate is broken. The petitioners have turned the EPA's own argument against them. While the EPA claimed the petitioners' reading would nullify the savings clause, the petitioners now persuasively argue that the EPA's reading of the savings clause would \"swallow the rule\" for regional review. They contend that since air pollution is inherently interstate, almost any major action could be said to be based on a determination with nationwide effects under the EPA's logic, making the default rule of regional review the exception. This gives the petitioners a more powerful structural argument.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Petitioners' Narrative Strengthened):** The petitioners' \"gamesmanship\" narrative is now more compelling. By showing that the EPA's \"nationwide\" framework was not dispositive, they cast doubt on the agency's claim that its actions were driven purely by a need for national consistency. The reply brief reframes the EPA's approach as a procedural maneuver to secure a preferred forum (the D.C. Circuit), a narrative that is often viewed skeptically by the Court.\n\n6.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Shifted Toward Petitioners):** My confidence has shifted significantly. The case is no longer a \"toss-up.\" The petitioners' reply brief provided a powerful and fact-based rebuttal to the EPA's strongest argument. The \"core determination\" test offers the Court a clear, judicially manageable standard to rule for the petitioners. This path allows the Court to affirm the statute's default to regional review for prototypically local actions like SIP disapprovals, while still giving the savings clause meaning in cases where a single nationwide determination is truly the dispositive cause of an action. I now predict a likely victory for the petitioners.\n\n7.  **Epistemic State and Key Remaining Uncertainties (Updated Synthesis):** The primary uncertainty identified in my previous state\u2014how petitioners would rebut the EPA's savings clause argument\u2014has been resolved. The battle lines are now fully drawn around the meaning of \"based on\" in the savings clause. The petitioners have a strong textual, structural, and factual case. The EPA is left arguing for broad agency discretion in procedure and a wide reading of the savings clause. The next most valuable piece of information will be the oral argument, which will reveal which justices find the \"core determination\" test versus the \"but-for cause\" test more persuasive and how they view the practical implications of agency \"gamesmanship\" versus \"administrative efficiency.\"",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to evolve, with each piece of information refining the likely outcome. The analysis of the primary briefs established the core legal conflict, and the latest observation regarding amicus support provides a significant contextual signal that further solidifies my prediction.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable and Strong):** My belief in the strength of the petitioners' textualist argument remains firm. Their position\u2014that the \"action\" is the individual state plan disapproval and that the statute lists such disapprovals as prototypically local\u2014is textually sound. The reply brief's framing of the EPA's \"bundling\" theory as a \"form-over-substance\" maneuver to control venue remains a powerful counter.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Weakened):** My assessment of the EPA's arguments as plausible but vulnerable is unchanged.\n    *   **Prong 1: \"Nationally Applicable\":** The petitioners' rebuttal that this interpretation would render regional review meaningless for almost any Clean Air Act action remains effective.\n    *   **Prong 2: \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\":** This argument, previously the EPA's strongest, remains significantly undermined by the petitioners' \"core determination\" test. The factual claim that the EPA's nationwide framework was not the dispositive factor for disapproval (since it was also used for approvals) is a critical weakness in the EPA's case.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable and Refined):** The conflict is firmly established as a two-level statutory interpretation puzzle.\n    *   **Level 1 (Prong 1):** What is the \"final action\"? (single state disapproval vs. single multi-state rulemaking).\n    *   **Level 2 (Prong 2):** What does it mean for an action to be \"*based on* a determination\"? The key choice for the Court is between the EPA's broad \"but-for cause\" test and the petitioners' narrower \"core determination\" test, which focuses on the dispositive reason for the specific outcome.\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Petitioners' Advantage Stable):** The petitioners retain the upper hand. Their argument that the EPA's reading of the savings clause would \"swallow the rule\" for regional review is more structurally persuasive than the EPA's counter-argument. It better preserves the statute's default to regional review for local actions.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Petitioners' Narrative Significantly Strengthened):** The petitioners' \"gamesmanship\" narrative, already compelling after the reply brief, is now substantially reinforced by the latest observation. The EPA's claim that its actions were driven by a need for national consistency is further weakened by the lack of external support.\n\n6.  **Amicus Curiae Signal (New Belief):** The observation that no amicus briefs were filed in support of the respondent (the EPA) is a powerful negative signal. Typically, in cases involving significant questions of administrative law and environmental policy, the government's position would attract support from other stakeholders, such as states that benefit from the policy, environmental organizations, or administrative law scholars. The complete absence of such support is telling. It isolates the EPA and suggests that even its usual allies may view this procedural maneuver as an overreach. This silence lends significant weight to the petitioners' characterization of the EPA's action as a self-serving attempt to secure a favorable judicial forum rather than a principled application of the law.\n\n7.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Increased Confidence in Petitioner Victory):** My confidence has shifted from a \"likely victory\" to a \"very likely victory\" for the petitioners. The case is no longer just about the petitioners having the better legal arguments on paper; it's now also about the EPA's position being so procedurally aggressive that it failed to garner any public support from allied groups. The combination of a strong textual and structural argument from the petitioners and the deafening silence from the EPA's potential allies creates a compelling case for reversal. The Court now has both a clear legal path (adopting the \"core determination\" test) and a strong contextual reason (checking perceived agency overreach) to rule for the petitioners.\n\n8.  **Epistemic State and Key Remaining Uncertainties (Refined):** The primary legal uncertainty remains how the Justices will interpret the phrase \"based on\" in the savings clause. However, the political and practical context now weighs heavily against the EPA's interpretation. The lack of amicus support for the EPA is a strong signal that their position is viewed as extreme or unprincipled by the broader community, a factor the Court may implicitly consider. The next most valuable piece of information remains the oral argument, which will reveal if any Justice is sympathetic to the EPA's administrative efficiency argument despite the lack of external support and the strong \"gamesmanship\" narrative.",

It does not introduce new external evidence but rather confirms the significance of the previously analyzed information and outlines the next step in the information-gathering strategy. Consequently, my core beliefs about the case remain stable, with a minor refinement to my understanding of the remaining uncertainties.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable and Strong):** My belief remains firm that the petitioners' textual argument is superior. The argument that the \"action\" is the disapproval of a single state's plan, making it a prototypically local matter for regional circuit review, is legally robust. The characterization of the EPA's \"bundling\" of these disapprovals into a single notice as a form-over-substance maneuver to control venue continues to be a powerful and likely persuasive theme.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Stable and Weak):** The EPA's arguments remain plausible but legally vulnerable. The petitioners' counterarguments\u2014that the EPA's interpretation of \"nationally applicable\" would nullify regional review and that the nationwide framework was not the \"core determination\" for the disapprovals\u2014continue to expose significant weaknesses in the government's position.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable and Refined):** The case remains centered on a two-level statutory interpretation question: (1) defining the \"final action\" and (2) interpreting the phrase \"based on a determination\" in the venue-selection savings clause. The Court's choice between the EPA's broad \"but-for cause\" test and the petitioners' narrower \"core determination\" test is the dispositive legal pivot.\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Petitioners' Advantage Stable):** The petitioners' argument that the EPA's reading of the savings clause renders the default rule of regional review almost entirely meaningless (it \"swallows the rule\") remains the more structurally sound interpretation of the statute as a whole.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Petitioners' Narrative Significantly Strengthened):** The \"gamesmanship\" narrative is a powerful lens through which to view the case. The previous observation about the lack of amicus support for the EPA strongly reinforces this theme, and the current internal monologue confirms that this is a central pillar of my analysis.\n\n6.  **Amicus Curiae Signal (Stable and Confirmed as High-Impact):** The absence of any amicus briefs supporting the EPA remains a critical negative signal. The internal monologue confirms my assessment that this fact is a \"crucial piece of information,\" as it isolates the EPA and suggests its procedural tactics are viewed as an overreach even by potential allies. This silence powerfully undermines the EPA's narrative about seeking consistency and equity.\n\n7.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Stable at High Confidence in Petitioner Victory):** My confidence remains \"very high\" that the petitioners will prevail. The combination of superior textual/structural arguments and the strong contextual signal from the lack of amicus support for the EPA provides a clear legal path and a compelling policy reason (checking agency forum-shopping) for the Court to reverse the Tenth Circuit.\n\n8.  **Epistemic State and Key Remaining Uncertainties (Refined):** My primary uncertainty still revolves around how the Justices will choose to define \"based on.\" However, the latest observation refines my understanding of the immediate information landscape. While oral arguments remain a key future data point, the internal monologue highlights a more immediate and valuable piece of evidence to seek: the amicus briefs filed *in support of the petitioners*. Analyzing the breadth and nature of this support will complete the picture of the stakeholder landscape, either confirming or complicating the powerful \"agency gamesmanship\" narrative.

It \nrepresents approximately 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than 3 mil-\nlion companies and professional organizations of every \nsize, in every industry sector, and from every region of \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto represent the interests of its members in matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nTo that end, the Chamber regularly files amicus curiae \nbriefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues of con-\ncern to the nation\u2019s business community. \nThe Chamber has an interest in maintaining effi-\ncient and predictable mechanisms for judicial review \nof federal agency action.  An important, frequently re-\ncurring, and oft-litigated threshold question in such \ncases is which court or courts are the proper venue for \nchallenges.  All stakeholders\u2014even those whose un-\nderlying interests in the merits of a dispute may be \ndiametrically opposed\u2014have a shared interest in hav-\ning clear and readily administrable rules governing \nthe selection of venue.  Unpredictable and unclear \nvenue rules can lead to wasteful and time-consuming \nthreshold litigation about whether venue is proper, in-\ncreasing the overall cost and uncertainty, and delay-\ning the ultimate resolution, of challenges to agency ac-\ntion. \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, or its counsel, made any monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nThe venue provisions in Section 307(b)(1) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), are significant \nin their own right, as they specify venue for judicial \nreview of a broad range of actions taken by the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air \nAct\u2014actions that, individually and in aggregate, can \nhave significant practical and economic consequences \nfor members of the nation\u2019s business community.  Un-\ncertainty and confusion about the meaning of these \nimportant provisions can have significant negative ef-\nfects\u2014as vividly illustrated by the circumstances and \nlengthy procedural history of the cases under review \nand other related litigation. \nThe Chamber files this brief as amicus curiae in \nsupport of neither party, taking no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases.  Instead, the \nChamber urges the Court to adopt an interpretation \nthat provides clarity and predictability to all stake-\nholders, and minimizes or avoids unnecessary and \nwasteful threshold litigation over the appropriate \nvenue for challenges brought under the Clean Air Act.  \nIn the Chamber\u2019s view, those interests would be best \nserved by an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that is \nfaithful to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory con-\nstruction. \nBy contrast, interests in clarity and predictability \nwould be disserved by a reading that allows the gov-\nernment to unilaterally select (or even manipulate) \nthe proper venue through its choice of formalities, \nsuch as whether to \u201cbundle\u201d together several individ-\nual actions into a single omnibus notice for purposes \nof publication in the Federal Register.  Similarly, \n\n3 \n \ninterests in clarity and predictability would be dis-\nserved by an interpretation that fails to give meaning \nand independent significance to each of the separate \nprovisions in Section 307(b)(1), which provide guid-\nance to litigants by drawing a line between cases that \ncan be brought only in the D.C. Circuit and cases for \nwhich venue lies exclusively in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  The Court should not endorse a reading \nthat would deprive any portion of Section 307(b)(1), in-\ncluding the second sentence addressing cases to be \nbought in the regional circuits, of meaningful inde-\npendent effect.  Such a reading would not comport \nwith the statutory text and would have adverse conse-\nquences for members of the nation\u2019s business commu-\nnity and for other litigants. \n INTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The nation\u2019s businesses, no less than other liti-\ngants, benefit from clarity and predictability in rules \nregarding where and when lawsuits can be brought, \nincluding rules regarding the selection of venue in \nchallenges to federal agency action.  Litigants avoid \nspending time and money litigating threshold issues \nwhen it is clear up front which court should adjudicate \na particular dispute.  Clarity in the articulation of \nvenue principles, in turn, promotes predictability in \ntheir application, enabling private parties to make in-\nformed business and investment decisions and other-\nwise order their affairs.  In short, certainty, transpar-\nency, and predictability regarding where certain types \nof claims will be litigated yield real-world benefits to \nlitigants and other stakeholders. \n\n4 \n \nBy contrast, complexity and uncertainty in the \nrules governing where a case may be brought consume \nvaluable resources as parties litigate the choice of the \nappropriate forum.  In the context of litigation chal-\nlenging federal agency actions, uncertainty regarding \nvenue rules can generate still further inefficiencies, \nsuch as the filing and consideration of protective peti-\ntions in multiple courts, when the law is unclear as to \nwhich court is appropriate, and the preparation and \nconsideration of merits briefs in cases that are ulti-\nmately dismissed for improper venue.  Meanwhile, \nresolution of merits issues is delayed, undermining \nCongress\u2019s decision to expedite challenges to certain \nfederal agency actions by (as here) authorizing direct \nappellate review.  Delay in resolving challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions in administering the Clean Air Act can \nharm all stakeholders, increasing transition and com-\npliance costs for regulated parties, and extending pe-\nriods of uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under \nreview. \nII. \nSection 307(b)(1) specifies that EPA\u2019s nation-\nally applicable actions will be reviewed in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit, while regionally or locally applicable actions will \nbe reviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, unless \nsuch an action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.  Although the Chamber takes no \nposition on the Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, and does not attempt to provide a universal tax-\nonomy of the cases that belong in the D.C. Circuit ver-\nsus regional circuits, this brief offers several interpre-\ntative points that would advance interests of clarity \nand predictability. \n\n5 \n \nFirst, a key textual distinction in Section 307(b)(1) \nis whether a given EPA action is \u201cnationally\u201d versus \n\u201clocally \nor \nregionally\u201d \napplicable. \n 42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  While hard cases for drawing that line \nmay exist, the inquiry should remain focused on the \nsubstance of the actions being taken by EPA, with \nclose attention to the statutory authority pursuant to \nwhich EPA has acted.  That approach follows from the \nstatutory text, which defines venue for different cate-\ngories of cases by cross-referencing substantive provi-\nsions of the Clean Air Act.  Where the substance of an \nEPA action is specific to a particular region or locality, \nthat action should be reviewed in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  Conversely, when the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action is nationally applicable, the case belongs \nin the D.C. Circuit. \nSecond, and relatedly, venue determinations \nshould not turn on formalistic or procedural distinc-\ntions that are disconnected from the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action.  Such an interpretation would open the \ndoor to manipulation, undermining interests in pre-\ndictability and certainty.  It would be improper, there-\nfore, to treat the analysis of venue under Section \n307(b)(1) as affected or even determined by whether \nEPA decides to bundle multiple individual actions into \na single notice for publication in the Federal Register, \nif in fact each individual action pertains to a specific \nlocation.  Allowing such bundling to affect the venue \nanalysis would increase uncertainty and inefficiency \nfor actions that, in substance, are fundamentally local \nor regional in nature.  And it would disserve interests \nin predictability, because regulated parties would \nhave no way of knowing in advance whether EPA \n\n6 \n \nwould combine multiple individual actions (each re-\ngional or local in character) into a single publication \npackage.   \nThird, meaningful effect should be given to each \nseparate part of the venue provisions in Section \n307(b)(1).  Congress took care to identify and distin-\nguish between classes of cases that are always subject \nto review in the D.C. Circuit (first sentence), and clas-\nses of cases that are presumptively subject to review \nin the regional circuits (second sentence).  And Con-\ngress provided a narrow exception to the second sen-\ntence for regional actions that are \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d (third sen-\ntence).  The third sentence should be interpreted in \nlight of that structure and not as a means for overrid-\ning the division in the previous two sentences. \nIII. Applying these principles to the issues before \nthe Court in these cases, a natural starting point is to \nrecognize that the EPA disapprovals of state imple-\nmentation plans challenged in these cases lie in the \nheartland of Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s list of orders reviewa-\nble in the regional circuit courts.  EPA has argued that \nit can effectively channel any case to the D.C. Circuit \nby packaging together multiple individual actions; \nthat argument, however, runs afoul of each of the prin-\nciples discussed above, that interpretation of the \nvenue provisions should focus on the statutory text \nand the substance of EPA\u2019s actions and should give \nmeaningful effect to each sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  \nEPA has also argued that an action is reviewable in \nthe D.C. Circuit under the third sentence of Section \n307(b)(1), so long as EPA identifies some underlying \n\u201clegal and technical determinations\u201d that apply across \n\n7 \n \nstates and that constitute even one among many of the \nbut-for causes of its action.  That argument would, \nhowever, deprive the second sentence of Section \n307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect, because \nit should almost always be the case that, in taking a \nparticular action, the agency acknowledges and ap-\nplies a consistent framework or understanding of its \nClean Air Act authority that contributes to its deci-\nsionmaking in a material respect.  More is required to \ntrigger the third sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  The \ngovernment\u2019s reading, if adopted here, would deprive \nlitigants of clarity and predictability.   \nHowever the Court resolves the specific issues \npresented here, it should strive to adopt a clear inter-\npretation of the venue provisions of Section 307(b)(1) \nthat gives effect to each of their components.   \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nMembers \nof \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nBusiness \nCommunity, Like All Litigants, Benefit from \nClear and Predictable Rules Regarding \nVenue.  \nThis Court favors, and litigants benefit from, \n\u201cclear boundaries\u201d and \u201cadministrative simplicity\u201d \nwhen it comes to the interpretation of statutes dictat-\ning where a case should be heard.

Rev. 201, 202 \n(2004). \nIn cases such as this one involving challenges to \nfederal agency action, uncertainty over proper venue \ncan spawn unnecessary (and often fruitless) litigation \nin multiple respects.  For instance, although parties \nmay raise objections to venue in preliminary motions, \nappellate courts regularly carry venue questions with \nthe case, deferring their resolution to the merits panel.  \nSee, e.g., Order, Nev. Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDoc. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. \nEPA, No. 23-9509, Doc. No. 93 (10th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2023).  As a result, parties must devote considerable \ntime and resources to fully briefing the merits of a case \nthat may ultimately be transferred or dismissed for \nimproper venue, leading to duplication of effort and re-\nbriefing in the new forum.  E.g., Oklahoma v. EPA, 93 \nF.4th 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 2024).  And even where \nvenue is retained, the assigned court is forced to dedi-\ncate substantial energy to addressing venue issues.  \nSee Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2024 WL 5001991 \n(6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024) (devoting roughly 15 pages of \n41-page opinion to Section 307(b)(1) venue issue). \nAdditionally, to hedge against the risk that a pe-\ntition for review in one court might be dismissed on \nvenue grounds, parties often \u201cprotectively\u201d file cases in \nmultiple venues, leading to additional expenditures of \n\n10 \n \nresources by the courts and parties.  See, e.g., Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n2022) (noting that the petitioner had filed protective \npetition for review in Ninth Circuit, in case governed \nby Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act; holding that \nvenue was proper in Ninth Circuit); Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 926 F.3d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (similar).  This \nCourt encountered such a practice in National Associ-\nation of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, \nwhich addressed and resolved confusion over whether \na particular EPA decision fell within a statutorily enu-\nmerated list of actions that must be reviewed in fed-\neral courts of appeals, rather than district courts.  583 \nU.S. 109, 114 (2018).  Due to uncertainty regarding \nthis question, numerous parties had \u201cfile[d] \u2018protec-\ntive\u2019 petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals \nto preserve their challenges in the event that their Dis-\ntrict Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of juris-\ndiction.\u201d  Id. at 119.  Divergent jurisdictional decisions \nensued: one court of appeals exercised jurisdiction to \nstay EPA\u2019s rule, while a district court held that it had \njurisdiction to review the rule, and other district \ncourts dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Ibid. \nWhile parties and courts work to resolve confusion \nas to venue questions, the ultimate resolution of the \nunderlying merits is further delayed, with negative \npractical consequences for regulators, regulated enti-\nties, and other stakeholders.  For example, in the \nFourth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit litigation involv-\ning EPA\u2019s disapprovals of West Virginia\u2019s and Ala-\nbama\u2019s plans to address \u201cgood neighbor\u201d obligations \narising out of the most recent ozone air quality stand-\nards, the courts have postponed deciding the cases on \n\n11 \n \nthe merits pending this Court\u2019s resolution of the venue \nquestion.  Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11196, Doc. \nNo. 56 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2024); Order, West Virginia \nv. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. No. 126 (4th Cir. Oct. 21, \n2024).  In parallel cases in the Fifth and Eighth Cir-\ncuits, the courts likewise have not yet disposed of pe-\ntitions for review on the merits, despite having acted \non stay motions for those disapprovals more than 18 \nmonths ago.  See Order, Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-\n1320, Doc. No. 5280996 (8th Cir. May 25, 2023); Texas \nv. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 (5th Cir. May \n1, 2023). \nAll of these inefficiencies add up to very real costs \nfor litigants and the courts.  The resultant delays are \nhard to square with Congress\u2019s intention to expedite \nresolution of the challenges by allowing direct review \nin the courts of appeals.  See Virginia v. United States, \n74 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 1996) (direct appellate re-\nview creates a streamlined process for \u201cprompt and \nconclusive\u201d judicial review of agency actions); accord \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985) (direct appellate review of agency decisions \navoids \u201cduplication of the identical task in the district \ncourt and in the court of appeals\u201d).  And regulated par-\nties will incur higher transition and compliance costs, \nand all stakeholders will experience extended periods \nof uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under re-\nview. \nThese negative consequences can be mitigated, \nand clarity and predictability improved, by adopting \nan interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue rules \nthat adheres faithfully to the statutory text.  See An-\ntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \n\n12 \n \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, at xxix (2012) (interpre-\ntive approach grounded in the text will typically \u201cpro-\nvide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater \npredictability\u201d).  That precept is especially true with \nrespect to the interpretation of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhere Congress crafted a reticulated and balanced \nstatutory scheme that channels certain kinds of cases \nto the D.C. Circuit and others to the appropriate re-\ngional circuits. \nII. \nThis \nCourt \nShould \nInterpret \nSection \n307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act in a Manner \nthat \nProvides \nClear, \nPredictable, \nand \nAdministrable Principles for Determining \nVenue. \nSection 307(b)(1) provides a three-part structure \nfor determining which court of appeals must hear a pe-\ntition for review of a final action by EPA: \n\u2022 The first sentence of Section 307(b)(1) states \nthat a petition for review of any of an enumer-\nated list of EPA actions, \u201cor any other nation-\nally applicable regulations promulgated, or fi-\nnal action taken, by [EPA] under this chapter[,] \nmay be filed only in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. \n\u2022 The second sentence provides that a petition for \nreview of any of another enumerated list of EPA \nactions \u201cor any other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable may be filed \nonly in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \u201cfor the ap-\npropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u2022 The third sentence creates a limited exception \nto the second, stating that an action referenced \n\n13 \n \nin the second sentence is reviewable only in the \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It \nrepresents approximately 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than 3 mil-\nlion companies and professional organizations of every \nsize, in every industry sector, and from every region of \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto represent the interests of its members in matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nTo that end, the Chamber regularly files amicus curiae \nbriefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues of con-\ncern to the nation\u2019s business community. \nThe Chamber has an interest in maintaining effi-\ncient and predictable mechanisms for judicial review \nof federal agency action.  An important, frequently re-\ncurring, and oft-litigated threshold question in such \ncases is which court or courts are the proper venue for \nchallenges.  All stakeholders\u2014even those whose un-\nderlying interests in the merits of a dispute may be \ndiametrically opposed\u2014have a shared interest in hav-\ning clear and readily administrable rules governing \nthe selection of venue.  Unpredictable and unclear \nvenue rules can lead to wasteful and time-consuming \nthreshold litigation about whether venue is proper, in-\ncreasing the overall cost and uncertainty, and delay-\ning the ultimate resolution, of challenges to agency ac-\ntion. \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, or its counsel, made any monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nThe venue provisions in Section 307(b)(1) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), are significant \nin their own right, as they specify venue for judicial \nreview of a broad range of actions taken by the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air \nAct\u2014actions that, individually and in aggregate, can \nhave significant practical and economic consequences \nfor members of the nation\u2019s business community.  Un-\ncertainty and confusion about the meaning of these \nimportant provisions can have significant negative ef-\nfects\u2014as vividly illustrated by the circumstances and \nlengthy procedural history of the cases under review \nand other related litigation. \nThe Chamber files this brief as amicus curiae in \nsupport of neither party, taking no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases.  Instead, the \nChamber urges the Court to adopt an interpretation \nthat provides clarity and predictability to all stake-\nholders, and minimizes or avoids unnecessary and \nwasteful threshold litigation over the appropriate \nvenue for challenges brought under the Clean Air Act.  \nIn the Chamber\u2019s view, those interests would be best \nserved by an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that is \nfaithful to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory con-\nstruction. \nBy contrast, interests in clarity and predictability \nwould be disserved by a reading that allows the gov-\nernment to unilaterally select (or even manipulate) \nthe proper venue through its choice of formalities, \nsuch as whether to \u201cbundle\u201d together several individ-\nual actions into a single omnibus notice for purposes \nof publication in the Federal Register.  Similarly, \n\n3 \n \ninterests in clarity and predictability would be dis-\nserved by an interpretation that fails to give meaning \nand independent significance to each of the separate \nprovisions in Section 307(b)(1), which provide guid-\nance to litigants by drawing a line between cases that \ncan be brought only in the D.C. Circuit and cases for \nwhich venue lies exclusively in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  The Court should not endorse a reading \nthat would deprive any portion of Section 307(b)(1), in-\ncluding the second sentence addressing cases to be \nbought in the regional circuits, of meaningful inde-\npendent effect.  Such a reading would not comport \nwith the statutory text and would have adverse conse-\nquences for members of the nation\u2019s business commu-\nnity and for other litigants. \n INTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The nation\u2019s businesses, no less than other liti-\ngants, benefit from clarity and predictability in rules \nregarding where and when lawsuits can be brought, \nincluding rules regarding the selection of venue in \nchallenges to federal agency action.  Litigants avoid \nspending time and money litigating threshold issues \nwhen it is clear up front which court should adjudicate \na particular dispute.  Clarity in the articulation of \nvenue principles, in turn, promotes predictability in \ntheir application, enabling private parties to make in-\nformed business and investment decisions and other-\nwise order their affairs.  In short, certainty, transpar-\nency, and predictability regarding where certain types \nof claims will be litigated yield real-world benefits to \nlitigants and other stakeholders. \n\n4 \n \nBy contrast, complexity and uncertainty in the \nrules governing where a case may be brought consume \nvaluable resources as parties litigate the choice of the \nappropriate forum.  In the context of litigation chal-\nlenging federal agency actions, uncertainty regarding \nvenue rules can generate still further inefficiencies, \nsuch as the filing and consideration of protective peti-\ntions in multiple courts, when the law is unclear as to \nwhich court is appropriate, and the preparation and \nconsideration of merits briefs in cases that are ulti-\nmately dismissed for improper venue.  Meanwhile, \nresolution of merits issues is delayed, undermining \nCongress\u2019s decision to expedite challenges to certain \nfederal agency actions by (as here) authorizing direct \nappellate review.  Delay in resolving challenges to \nEPA\u2019s actions in administering the Clean Air Act can \nharm all stakeholders, increasing transition and com-\npliance costs for regulated parties, and extending pe-\nriods of uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under \nreview. \nII. \nSection 307(b)(1) specifies that EPA\u2019s nation-\nally applicable actions will be reviewed in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit, while regionally or locally applicable actions will \nbe reviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, unless \nsuch an action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.  Although the Chamber takes no \nposition on the Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, and does not attempt to provide a universal tax-\nonomy of the cases that belong in the D.C. Circuit ver-\nsus regional circuits, this brief offers several interpre-\ntative points that would advance interests of clarity \nand predictability. \n\n5 \n \nFirst, a key textual distinction in Section 307(b)(1) \nis whether a given EPA action is \u201cnationally\u201d versus \n\u201clocally \nor \nregionally\u201d \napplicable. \n 42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1).  While hard cases for drawing that line \nmay exist, the inquiry should remain focused on the \nsubstance of the actions being taken by EPA, with \nclose attention to the statutory authority pursuant to \nwhich EPA has acted.  That approach follows from the \nstatutory text, which defines venue for different cate-\ngories of cases by cross-referencing substantive provi-\nsions of the Clean Air Act.  Where the substance of an \nEPA action is specific to a particular region or locality, \nthat action should be reviewed in the appropriate re-\ngional circuit.  Conversely, when the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action is nationally applicable, the case belongs \nin the D.C. Circuit. \nSecond, and relatedly, venue determinations \nshould not turn on formalistic or procedural distinc-\ntions that are disconnected from the substance of \nEPA\u2019s action.  Such an interpretation would open the \ndoor to manipulation, undermining interests in pre-\ndictability and certainty.  It would be improper, there-\nfore, to treat the analysis of venue under Section \n307(b)(1) as affected or even determined by whether \nEPA decides to bundle multiple individual actions into \na single notice for publication in the Federal Register, \nif in fact each individual action pertains to a specific \nlocation.  Allowing such bundling to affect the venue \nanalysis would increase uncertainty and inefficiency \nfor actions that, in substance, are fundamentally local \nor regional in nature.  And it would disserve interests \nin predictability, because regulated parties would \nhave no way of knowing in advance whether EPA \n\n6 \n \nwould combine multiple individual actions (each re-\ngional or local in character) into a single publication \npackage.   \nThird, meaningful effect should be given to each \nseparate part of the venue provisions in Section \n307(b)(1).  Congress took care to identify and distin-\nguish between classes of cases that are always subject \nto review in the D.C. Circuit (first sentence), and clas-\nses of cases that are presumptively subject to review \nin the regional circuits (second sentence).  And Con-\ngress provided a narrow exception to the second sen-\ntence for regional actions that are \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d (third sen-\ntence).  The third sentence should be interpreted in \nlight of that structure and not as a means for overrid-\ning the division in the previous two sentences. \nIII. Applying these principles to the issues before \nthe Court in these cases, a natural starting point is to \nrecognize that the EPA disapprovals of state imple-\nmentation plans challenged in these cases lie in the \nheartland of Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s list of orders reviewa-\nble in the regional circuit courts.  EPA has argued that \nit can effectively channel any case to the D.C. Circuit \nby packaging together multiple individual actions; \nthat argument, however, runs afoul of each of the prin-\nciples discussed above, that interpretation of the \nvenue provisions should focus on the statutory text \nand the substance of EPA\u2019s actions and should give \nmeaningful effect to each sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  \nEPA has also argued that an action is reviewable in \nthe D.C. Circuit under the third sentence of Section \n307(b)(1), so long as EPA identifies some underlying \n\u201clegal and technical determinations\u201d that apply across \n\n7 \n \nstates and that constitute even one among many of the \nbut-for causes of its action.  That argument would, \nhowever, deprive the second sentence of Section \n307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect, because \nit should almost always be the case that, in taking a \nparticular action, the agency acknowledges and ap-\nplies a consistent framework or understanding of its \nClean Air Act authority that contributes to its deci-\nsionmaking in a material respect.  More is required to \ntrigger the third sentence of Section 307(b)(1).  The \ngovernment\u2019s reading, if adopted here, would deprive \nlitigants of clarity and predictability.   \nHowever the Court resolves the specific issues \npresented here, it should strive to adopt a clear inter-\npretation of the venue provisions of Section 307(b)(1) \nthat gives effect to each of their components.   \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nMembers \nof \nthe \nNation\u2019s \nBusiness \nCommunity, Like All Litigants, Benefit from \nClear and Predictable Rules Regarding \nVenue.  \nThis Court favors, and litigants benefit from, \n\u201cclear boundaries\u201d and \u201cadministrative simplicity\u201d \nwhen it comes to the interpretation of statutes dictat-\ning where a case should be heard.

As courts and commentators \nhave long recognized, such \u201cclarity generally reduces \nlitigant costs,\u201d Scott Dodson, The Complexity of Juris-\ndictional Clarity, 97 Va. L.

L. Rev. 1211, 1225 \n(2004). \nSimple rules \u201cpromote greater predictability,\u201d \nwhich also \u201cis valuable to corporations making busi-\nness and investment decisions,\u201d Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94, \nand \u201cfacilitate[s] efficient private bargaining in the \nshadow of the law,\u201d Jonathan Remy Nash, On the Ef-\nficient Deployment of Rules and Standards to Define \nFederal Jurisdiction, 65 Vand. L. Rev. 509, 522 (2012); \nsee also William Grayson Lambert, The Necessary \nNarrowing of General Personal Jurisdiction, 100 \nMarq. L. Rev. 375, 415 (2016) (clear and predictable \nrules \u201callow[] individuals and businesses to order their \naffairs and have rational expectations about where po-\ntential disputes could be resolved\u201d). \nOn the other hand, complex tests governing juris-\ndiction, venue, and other threshold questions \u201ccompli-\ncate a case, eating up time and money as the parties \nlitigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court \nis the right court to decide those claims.\u201d  Hertz, 559 \nU.S. at 94; see also Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. \n458, 464 n.13 (1980) (in discussing related question of \njurisdiction, emphasizing that \u201c[i]t is of first im-\nportance to have a definition * * * [that] will not invite \nextensive threshold litigation * * * over whether the \ncase is in the right court,\u201d which \u201cis essentially a waste \nof time and resources\u201d).  Complex and unclear rules \n\u201cproduce appeals and reversals, [and] encourage \ngamesmanship.\u201d  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94; see also Dod-\nson, supra, at 8 (\u201c[W]hen the court does resolve a ju-\nrisdictional issue under clear doctrine, that decision is \nlikely to be accurate, causing fewer appeals and fewer \n\n9 \n \nreversals.\u201d).  The resources spent litigating such ques-\ntions \u201ccould otherwise be used to expand business, cre-\nate jobs, and develop new products\u201d; in many contexts, \nthose costs may instead be \u201cpassed on to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices.\u201d  Lisa Litwiller, Why Amend-\nments to Rule 23 Are Not Enough: A Case for the Fed-\neralization of Class Actions, 7 Chap. L. Rev. 201, 202 \n(2004). \nIn cases such as this one involving challenges to \nfederal agency action, uncertainty over proper venue \ncan spawn unnecessary (and often fruitless) litigation \nin multiple respects.  For instance, although parties \nmay raise objections to venue in preliminary motions, \nappellate courts regularly carry venue questions with \nthe case, deferring their resolution to the merits panel.  \nSee, e.g., Order, Nev. Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDoc. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. \nEPA, No. 23-9509, Doc. No. 93 (10th Cir. Apr. 27, \n2023).  As a result, parties must devote considerable \ntime and resources to fully briefing the merits of a case \nthat may ultimately be transferred or dismissed for \nimproper venue, leading to duplication of effort and re-\nbriefing in the new forum.  E.g., Oklahoma v. EPA, 93 \nF.4th 1262, 1269 (10th Cir. 2024).  And even where \nvenue is retained, the assigned court is forced to dedi-\ncate substantial energy to addressing venue issues.  \nSee Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2024 WL 5001991 \n(6th Cir. Dec. 6, 2024) (devoting roughly 15 pages of \n41-page opinion to Section 307(b)(1) venue issue). \nAdditionally, to hedge against the risk that a pe-\ntition for review in one court might be dismissed on \nvenue grounds, parties often \u201cprotectively\u201d file cases in \nmultiple venues, leading to additional expenditures of \n\n10 \n \nresources by the courts and parties.  See, e.g., Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n2022) (noting that the petitioner had filed protective \npetition for review in Ninth Circuit, in case governed \nby Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act; holding that \nvenue was proper in Ninth Circuit); Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 926 F.3d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (similar).  This \nCourt encountered such a practice in National Associ-\nation of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense, \nwhich addressed and resolved confusion over whether \na particular EPA decision fell within a statutorily enu-\nmerated list of actions that must be reviewed in fed-\neral courts of appeals, rather than district courts.  583 \nU.S. 109, 114 (2018).  Due to uncertainty regarding \nthis question, numerous parties had \u201cfile[d] \u2018protec-\ntive\u2019 petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals \nto preserve their challenges in the event that their Dis-\ntrict Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of juris-\ndiction.\u201d  Id. at 119.  Divergent jurisdictional decisions \nensued: one court of appeals exercised jurisdiction to \nstay EPA\u2019s rule, while a district court held that it had \njurisdiction to review the rule, and other district \ncourts dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Ibid. \nWhile parties and courts work to resolve confusion \nas to venue questions, the ultimate resolution of the \nunderlying merits is further delayed, with negative \npractical consequences for regulators, regulated enti-\nties, and other stakeholders.  For example, in the \nFourth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit litigation involv-\ning EPA\u2019s disapprovals of West Virginia\u2019s and Ala-\nbama\u2019s plans to address \u201cgood neighbor\u201d obligations \narising out of the most recent ozone air quality stand-\nards, the courts have postponed deciding the cases on \n\n11 \n \nthe merits pending this Court\u2019s resolution of the venue \nquestion.  Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11196, Doc. \nNo. 56 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2024); Order, West Virginia \nv. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. No. 126 (4th Cir. Oct. 21, \n2024).  In parallel cases in the Fifth and Eighth Cir-\ncuits, the courts likewise have not yet disposed of pe-\ntitions for review on the merits, despite having acted \non stay motions for those disapprovals more than 18 \nmonths ago.  See Order, Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-\n1320, Doc. No. 5280996 (8th Cir. May 25, 2023); Texas \nv. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 (5th Cir. May \n1, 2023). \nAll of these inefficiencies add up to very real costs \nfor litigants and the courts.  The resultant delays are \nhard to square with Congress\u2019s intention to expedite \nresolution of the challenges by allowing direct review \nin the courts of appeals.  See Virginia v. United States, \n74 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 1996) (direct appellate re-\nview creates a streamlined process for \u201cprompt and \nconclusive\u201d judicial review of agency actions); accord \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985) (direct appellate review of agency decisions \navoids \u201cduplication of the identical task in the district \ncourt and in the court of appeals\u201d).  And regulated par-\nties will incur higher transition and compliance costs, \nand all stakeholders will experience extended periods \nof uncertainty while EPA\u2019s actions remain under re-\nview. \nThese negative consequences can be mitigated, \nand clarity and predictability improved, by adopting \nan interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue rules \nthat adheres faithfully to the statutory text.  See An-\ntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \n\n12 \n \nInterpretation of Legal Texts, at xxix (2012) (interpre-\ntive approach grounded in the text will typically \u201cpro-\nvide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater \npredictability\u201d).  That precept is especially true with \nrespect to the interpretation of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhere Congress crafted a reticulated and balanced \nstatutory scheme that channels certain kinds of cases \nto the D.C. Circuit and others to the appropriate re-\ngional circuits. \nII. \nThis \nCourt \nShould \nInterpret \nSection \n307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act in a Manner \nthat \nProvides \nClear, \nPredictable, \nand \nAdministrable Principles for Determining \nVenue. \nSection 307(b)(1) provides a three-part structure \nfor determining which court of appeals must hear a pe-\ntition for review of a final action by EPA: \n\u2022 The first sentence of Section 307(b)(1) states \nthat a petition for review of any of an enumer-\nated list of EPA actions, \u201cor any other nation-\nally applicable regulations promulgated, or fi-\nnal action taken, by [EPA] under this chapter[,] \nmay be filed only in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit. \n\u2022 The second sentence provides that a petition for \nreview of any of another enumerated list of EPA \nactions \u201cor any other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable may be filed \nonly in\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals \u201cfor the ap-\npropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u2022 The third sentence creates a limited exception \nto the second, stating that an action referenced \n\n13 \n \nin the second sentence is reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit \u201cif such action is based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect \nand if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added).   \nThree principles from this text provide a helpful \nguide for understanding its application in cases like \nthese.   \n1.  First, decisions about whether a particular \nEPA action is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable,\u201d or \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d should be grounded in the \nsubstance of the relevant actions EPA is taking.  This \ninterpretation aligns with, and follows from, the de-\ntailed statutory enumerations of actions reviewable in \nparticular circuits that Congress included here.   \nThe references to specific categories of agency ac-\ntions in Section 307(b)(1) focus on the substantive na-\nture of, and legal authority underlying, those actions, \nas indicated by the extensive statutory cross-refer-\nences to other substantive provisions of the Clean Air \nAct authorizing EPA to act.  For example, the actions \nthat are to be reviewed exclusively by the D.C. Circuit \ninclude those that promulgate \u201cany national * * * am-\nbient air quality standard [NAAQS],\u201d \u201cany emission \nstandard\u201d for hazardous air pollutants under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412, and \u201cany standard of performance\u201d for \nstationary sources of pollutants under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7411.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  Actions presump-\ntively reviewable in the appropriate regional circuit, \n\n14 \n \nby contrast, include \u201capproving or promulgating any \n[state] implementation plan\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410, \nany order granting a waiver of performance require-\nments for a specific emissions source (\u201cwith the con-\nsent of the Governor of the State in which the source \nis to be located\u201d) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(j), and any \norder imposing a noncompliance penalty for a specific \nemissions source under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7420.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Court can thus infer that, where the statute \nsubsequently refers to \u201cany other nationally applicable \n* * * final action,\u201d \u201cany other final action * * * which is \nlocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \u201ca determination \nof nationwide scope or effect,\u201d Congress was likewise \nconcerned with whether the substance of the agency\u2019s \naction has national, local, or regional applicability, or \nwhether the substance of the underlying determina-\ntion has nationwide scope or effect.  See Bissonnette v. \nLePage Bakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 \n(2024) (Under the ejusdem generis canon, \u201ccourts in-\nterpret a general or collective term at the end of a list \nof specific items in light of any common attribute[s] \nshared by the specific items.\u201d) (quotation marks omit-\nted).  Under this textual and interpretative approach, \nthe appropriate regional circuit should review an EPA \naction that makes determinations specific to a partic-\nular locality or region. \n2.  Second, and relatedly, venue selection should \nnot turn on purely formalistic distinctions or factors \nthat are otherwise disconnected from the substance of \nthe agency action in question, such as EPA\u2019s decision \n(or not) to \u201cbundle\u201d individual actions together for pur-\nposes of publication in the Federal Register.  The \n\n15 \n \nenumeration of EPA actions in Section 307(b)(1), as \ndiscussed above, looks to the underlying substantive \nauthority being exercised, not the form in which the \nagency chooses to publish one or more of its actions.  \nIndeed, if Congress had wanted to peg reviewability to \nthe form in which EPA published its actions, it could \neasily have done so.  Instead, Congress gave EPA care-\nfully limited discretion, via the third sentence of Sec-\ntion 307(b)(1), to choose whether to publish a finding \nthat its local or regional action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect.  This Court should \nnot adopt an interpretation of Section 307(b)(1) that \nwould vest EPA with the much broader discretion to \nchannel virtually any case to the D.C. Circuit by re-\ndefining the nature of the action via an atextual \u201cbun-\ndling\u201d theory. \nBy tying review to the substance of EPA\u2019s action, \nCongress also avoided opening the venue question to \nthe sort of manipulation that this Court has sought to \ndiscourage.  Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94.  And it promoted \npredictability and certainty for regulated parties, who \ncommonly undertake a great deal of decisionmaking \nand preparatory work in advance of an EPA order\u2014\nwhether in seeking authorizations, investing in future \ncompliance, or in making other strategic business \njudgments\u2014some of which may be affected by the ex-\npected venue in which a petition for review of the \nagency\u2019s action may be heard.  See Hertz, 559 U.S. at \n94; Nash, supra, at 522; Lambert, supra, at 415.  If the \nform in which EPA chooses to publish an agency action \nprevails over the substance of the action in determin-\ning venue, the resulting uncertainty would hamper \n\n16 \n \nregulated parties\u2019 ability to engage in informed deci-\nsionmaking. \nIndeed, if discretionary, formalistic characteris-\ntics like the \u201cbundling\u201d of actions for publication were \ndispositive under Section 307(b)(1), confusion as to the \nproper venue could linger even after EPA issues a no-\ntice combining various regionally applicable actions.  \nAssuming for the sake of argument that an EPA action \nbecomes \u201cnational\u201d in character merely because it has \nbeen published together with numerous other actions \nthat, collectively, cover different areas of the country, \n\u201c[w]ould this logic reach an action that covered only \nCalifornia, Maine, and Alabama because they fall in \ndifferent parts of the country?  If not, how many more \nStates are needed?\u201d  Kentucky, 2024 WL 5001991, at \n*8.   \nChanneling cases to the D.C. Circuit for reasons \nof form rather than substance would pose particular \nproblems whenever the agency concurrently issues a \nlarge number of actions that are each locally focused \nand fact-intensive.  The administrative record for any \nindividual agency action can consist of many hundreds \nor thousands of pages.  But where EPA\u2019s decision in \nreality consists of a series of distinct actions, each rest-\ning on individualized, fact-bound analysis focused on a \nparticular state or region, the aggregation of all those \nactions into a single review proceeding before a single \ncourt could easily result in an excessively large record \nand a need for briefs covering a panoply of complex is-\nsues specific to each of EPA\u2019s actions.  Forcing such \ncases to the D.C. Circuit could place significant strain \non judicial resources, as well as deprive the parties of \na full opportunity to argue the complex, locality-\n\n17 \n \nspecific issues that would be more fully vetted in a pro-\nceeding in a regional circuit devoted to those issues \nalone\u2014as Congress intended.  \n3.  Third, meaningful effect must be given  to each \nof the separate provisions in Section 307(b)(1)\u2014in-\ncluding the first, second, and third sentences.  After \nall, it is a \u201ccardinal principle of interpretation that \ncourts must give effect, if possible, to every clause and \nword of a statute.\u201d  Liu v. SEC, 591 U.S. 71, 89 (2020).  \nIn applying ordinary principles of statutory construc-\ntion, this Court has long avoided interpretations that \nwould treat any aspect of Congress\u2019s scheme as \u201cmean-\ningless\u201d or having \u201cno consequence.\u201d  Ibid.; Nielsen v. \nPreap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 (2019). \nHere, Congress divided responsibility for review of \nEPA\u2019s decisions under this scheme between the D.C. \nCircuit and the regional circuits.  This Court should \nadopt a reading that respects the balance that Con-\ngress struck, and does not deprive one provision of the \nstatute of meaningful effect (e.g., the part enumerat-\ning cases to be heard \u201conly\u201d in the regional circuits) \nthrough an overbroad interpretation of another provi-\nsion (e.g., the part ensuring that certain actions based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect are \nreviewed \u201conly\u201d in the D.C. Circuit).  The balance \nstruck by Congress accounts for a variety of consider-\nations.  For example, Congress presumably knew that \nregional circuit courts are most likely to be familiar \nwith and well-informed regarding legal and factual is-\nsues that affect local and regional interests.  These can \ninclude principles of state law that often arise in coop-\nerative federalism regimes such as the Clean Air Act, \nand the mix of legal, economic, social, and other \n\n18 \n \npractical considerations affecting major regulatory ac-\ntions.  See State Br. 54-55; cf. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d \n405, 424 (5th Cir. 2016) (asserting venue over chal-\nlenges to EPA\u2019s disapproval of Texas\u2019s and Oklahoma\u2019s \nplans for implementing air visibility standards); Texas \nv. EPA, 706 F. App\u2019x 159 (5th Cir. 2017) (same, for \nEPA\u2019s designation of three areas in Texas as not at-\ntaining revised air quality standards for sulfur diox-\nide).  And channeling regionally focused EPA actions \nto the regional circuits avoids disconnecting litigation \nfrom the areas where the effects of the agency\u2019s action \nare most acutely and directly felt.  So too does siting \ncases in the regional circuits avoid burdening litigants \nwith the higher travel and logistical costs associated \nwith litigating challenges in D.C.  And it avoids poten-\ntial optical concerns that an agency may enjoy a \n\u201chometown advantage\u201d in defending its decisions in \nWashington, D.C. \nBy contrast, siting review of truly nationally ap-\nplicable regulations, and certain determinations of na-\ntionwide scope or effect, in the D.C. Circuit avoids the \nprospect of conflicting decisions from multiple circuits \nover the same agency actions.  Multiple petitions filed \nin the D.C. Circuit can simply be consolidated, allow-\ning for more efficient review for all\u2014the government, \nprivate litigants, and the courts. \nIn sum, Congress contemplated that both the D.C. \nCircuit and regional circuits would have a meaningful \nrole.  This is not a statute, like some, that centralizes \n\n19 \n \nall review in the D.C. Circuit,2 or that vests regional \ncircuits with exclusive and irrebuttable jurisdiction \nover an entire category of cases.3  None of the sen-\ntences in Section 307(b)(1)\u2019s venue provisions should \nbe interpreted to undermine Congress\u2019s choices in as-\nsigning venue for judicial review of different kinds of \nEPA actions. \nIII. As Applied in These Cases, These Principles \nSupport Adopting an Interpretation that \nGives Real and Substantial Effect to Each \nPart of Section 307(b)(1). \nAlthough the Chamber takes no position on the \nCourt\u2019s ultimate judgment in these cases, the princi-\nples articulated above should provide helpful guidance \nin resolving the specific venue questions presented \nhere.  These cases concern EPA\u2019s disapproval of Utah\u2019s \nand Oklahoma\u2019s state plans for implementing EPA\u2019s \nozone standards under the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cGood \nNeighbor Provision.\u201d  State Pet. 1; see 88 Fed. Reg. \n9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  The cases thus involve EPA ac-\ntions that lie in the heartland of the list of actions enu-\nmerated in the second sentence of Section 307(b)(1), \nwhich include those actions that \u201capprov[e] or promul-\ngat[e] any implementation plan\u201d for EPA\u2019s air quality \nstandards, as well as any locally or regionally applica-\nble \u201cdenial or disapproval\u201d of such a plan.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1);  accord Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023) \n \n2 Cf., e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(a)(1) (Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(a) (Comprehensive Environmen-\ntal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). \n3 Cf. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1) (Natural Gas Act). \n\n20 \n \n(\u201cJust as most * * * approvals of SIPs * * * unequivo-\ncally fall in the \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 cate-\ngory, so too does the disapproval of SIPs.\u201d) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); see also Chevron, 45 \nF.4th at 386 (\u201cApproving or promulgating a State Im-\nplementation Plan is the prototypical \u2018locally or re-\ngionally applicable\u2019 action that may be challenged only \nin the appropriate regional court of appeals.\u201d) (cleaned \nup).  The statute thus appears to create a presumption \nthat actions of the kind at issue here should be re-\nviewed in the appropriate regional circuit, rather than \nthe D.C. Circuit. \nIn resisting that conclusion, the government has \nargued that its disapprovals were \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d implicating the first sentence of Section 307(b)(1), \nbecause EPA published one document combining the \ndisapprovals of various state implementation plans, \nand because each disapproval was based on a common \n\u201cprocess and standard.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. Br. 10; see \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9380 (arguing that combined SIP dis-\napprovals amounted to a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action \nunder Section 307(b)(1) because \u201cEPA is applying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods * * * in a large number of states lo-\ncated across the country\u201d; also citing \u201cthe interdepend-\nent nature of interstate pollution transport and the \ncommon core of knowledge and analysis involved in \nevaluating the submitted SIPs\u201d).  Alternatively, EPA \nargues that its disapprovals were based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope and effect, implicating the \nexception in the third sentence, because EPA relied on \n\u201clegal and technical determinations that applied \nacross the various States.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. Br. 10; \n\n21 \n \nsee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9380-9381.  But as discussed above, \nEPA\u2019s bundling argument is difficult to reconcile with \nan interpretative approach that focuses on the sub-\nstance and underlying statutory authority of each of \nEPA\u2019s actions, rather than distinctions based on ad-\nministrative convenience or form. \n \nEPA\u2019s interpretation risks depriving the second \nsentence of any real and meaningful effect, thereby \nundermining interests of clarity and predictability.  \nSee Brohl, 575 U.S. at 11; Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94.  There \nis no apparent constraint on EPA\u2019s ability to bundle \nmultiple locally focused decisions into a single rule or \norder for purposes of publication, as it did here.  See \nState Br. 30.  So if the \u201cbundling\u201d of individual local or \nor regional actions transformed those discrete actions \ninto a single, national action, the agency would effec-\ntively \u201chave the choice\u201d of which tribunal would hear \na case, and it could ensure that virtually none of its \nactions were reviewed outside the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTravis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961).   \nSimilar concerns are implicated by an interpreta-\ntion that would justify venue in the D.C. Circuit any \ntime the agency has taken action to deny a state im-\nplementation plan while utilizing \u201ca uniform process \nand standard\u201d or common \u201clegal and technical deter-\nminations.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Cert. Resp. 10.  It is difficult to dis-\ncern a meaningful limiting principle in that position, \na problem exacerbated by the government\u2019s expan-\nsively worded assertions of discretion in this area.  See \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9380-9381 (asserting that \u201c[f]or locally \nor regionally applicable final actions, the [Clean Air \nAct] reserves to the EPA complete discretion whether \nto invoke\u201d third sentence of the venue provisions) \n\n22 \n \n(emphasis added); id. at 9380-81 (twice stating that \n\u201cthe Administrator is exercising [his] complete discre-\ntion\u201d) (emphasis added); id. at 9380 n.337 (\u201cIn deciding \nwhether to invoke the exception * * *, the Administra-\ntor takes into account a number of policy considera-\ntions, including his judgment balancing the benefit of \nobtaining the D.C. Circuit\u2019s authoritative centralized \nreview versus allowing development of the issue in \nother contexts and the best use of agency resources.\u201d).   \nIn virtually every action under the Clean Air Act, \nthe agency will, to some non-trivial extent, rely on and \napply a consistent, generally applicable understand-\ning of the statutes and rules governing its administra-\ntion of the Clean Air Act.  See West Virginia v. EPA, \n90 F.4th 323, 329-330 (4th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[I]f application \nof a national standard  * * * were the controlling fac-\ntor, there never could be a local or regional action as \nrecognized by the Clean Air Act because every action \nof the EPA purportedly applies a national standard.\u201d); \nChevron, 45 F.4th at 387 (\u201c[M]any locally or regionally \napplicable actions may require interpretation of the \nClean Air Act\u2019s statutory terms, and that kind of in-\nterpretive exercise alone does not transform a locally \napplicable action into a nationally applicable one.  * * *  \n[T]hat a challenged action \u2018applies a broad regulation \nto a specific context\u2019 and \u2018may set a precedent for fu-\nture * * * proceedings\u2019 does not make it nationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d).  The Court should not adopt an interpreta-\ntion of Section 307(b)(1) that would, as a practical mat-\nter, give EPA sweeping discretion to decide venue and \nrender the second sentence\u2019s regional-review provision \na dead letter in most, if not all, cases, subverting \n\n23 \n \nCongress\u2019s intent as reflected in the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted. \n CONCLUSION \nWhatever this Court\u2019s ultimate judgment in these \ncases, it should adopt a clear interpretation of Section \n307(b)(1), grounded firmly in the statutory text, that \npromotes predictability and certainty in the selection \nof venue. \n\n24 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was a failed internal search action. It provided no new substantive information about the case, as the query for petitioner-side amicus briefs failed to execute due to a technical error. Consequently, my core beliefs about the legal merits and likely outcome remain unchanged, but my understanding of the current information gap has been reinforced.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable and Strong):** My belief remains firm that the petitioners' textual argument is superior. The argument that the \"action\" is the disapproval of a single state's plan, making it a prototypically local matter for regional circuit review, is legally robust. The characterization of the EPA's \"bundling\" of these disapprovals into a single notice as a form-over-substance maneuver to control venue continues to be a powerful and likely persuasive theme.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Stable and Weak):** The EPA's arguments remain plausible but legally vulnerable. The petitioners' counterarguments\u2014that the EPA's interpretation of \"nationally applicable\" would nullify regional review and that the nationwide framework was not the \"core determination\" for the disapprovals\u2014continue to expose significant weaknesses in the government's position.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable):** The case remains centered on a two-level statutory interpretation question: (1) defining the \"final action\" and (2) interpreting the phrase \"based on a determination\" in the venue-selection savings clause. The Court's choice between the EPA's broad \"but-for cause\" test and the petitioners' narrower \"core determination\" test is the dispositive legal pivot.\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Petitioners' Advantage Stable):** The petitioners' argument that the EPA's reading of the savings clause renders the default rule of regional review almost entirely meaningless (it \"swallows the rule\") remains the more structurally sound interpretation of the statute as a whole.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Petitioners' Narrative Significantly Strengthened):** The \"gamesmanship\" narrative is a powerful lens through which to view the case. The previously noted lack of amicus support for the EPA strongly reinforces this theme.\n\n6.  **Amicus Curiae Signal (Stable and Confirmed as High-Impact):** The absence of any amicus briefs supporting the EPA remains a critical negative signal. This silence powerfully undermines the EPA's narrative about seeking consistency and equity and suggests its procedural tactics are viewed as an overreach even by potential allies.\n\n7.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Stable at High Confidence in Petitioner Victory):** My confidence remains \"very high\" that the petitioners will prevail. The combination of superior textual/structural arguments and the strong contextual signal from the lack of amicus support for the EPA provides a clear legal path and a compelling policy reason (checking agency forum-shopping) for the Court to reverse the Tenth Circuit.\n\n8.  **Epistemic State and Key Uncertainties (Uncertainty Persists):** My previous belief state identified the amicus briefs filed *in support of the petitioners* as the most valuable next piece of information to acquire. This would complete the picture of the stakeholder landscape and either confirm or complicate the powerful \"agency gamesmanship\" narrative. The latest observation confirms that this information has not yet been obtained due to a failed search. Therefore, this specific uncertainty remains unresolved. The informational gap I sought to close persists, and the value of successfully acquiring this information remains high. My next information-gathering step should be to re-attempt this search or find an alternative method to identify the petitioners' amicus supporters.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous information gap regarding petitioner-side amicus support has now been filled by a significant observation. The successful search did not yield a brief explicitly \"in support of petitioners,\" but instead revealed a highly consequential brief from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed \"in support of neither party.\" This seemingly neutral stance is deceptive; the brief's substantive arguments strongly align with the petitioners' legal reasoning and directly attack the EPA's position. This new information significantly sharpens my understanding of the case's dynamics and reinforces my prediction.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Stable and Substantively Bolstered):** My belief in the superiority of the petitioners' textual argument is now reinforced by a major, sophisticated amicus. The Chamber of Commerce brief, while officially neutral, argues that venue rules should be \"clear and predictable\" and should not be determined by agency \"formalities, such as whether to \u2018bundle\u2019 together several individual actions into a single omnibus notice.\" This directly supports the petitioners' core argument that the \"action\" is the state-specific disapproval and that the EPA's bundling is a procedural maneuver to manipulate venue.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Core Arguments (Stable and Further Weakened):** The Chamber of Commerce's arguments provide a powerful third-party critique of the EPA's position. The Chamber explicitly warns against the EPA's interpretation, stating it would allow the government to \"unilaterally select (or even manipulate) the proper venue.\" This adds significant weight to the view that the EPA's arguments are not just textually weak but also create a dangerous precedent for agency overreach, a theme that is likely to resonate with the Court.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Dispute (Stable, with Petitioner's Interpretation Strengthened):** The case remains centered on defining the \"final action\" and interpreting the \"based on a determination\" savings clause. The Chamber's brief squarely addresses the latter, arguing that the EPA's broad \"but-for\" test \"would deprive the second sentence of Section 307(b)(1) of much, if not all, meaningful effect.\" This provides strong, independent support for the petitioners' narrower \"core determination\" test as the only interpretation that preserves the statute's structure.\n\n4.  **The Battle of the Surplusage Canon (Petitioner's Advantage Confirmed and Amplified):** My prior belief that the petitioners' surplusage argument was superior is now explicitly confirmed by the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber's argument that the EPA's reading fails to \"give meaning and independent significance to each of the separate provisions in Section 307(b)(1)\" and would render the regional review provision meaningless is a direct echo of the petitioners' strongest structural point. This alignment makes the argument significantly more persuasive.\n\n5.  **Decisive Theme of Agency \"Gamesmanship\" vs. \"Consistency and Equity\" (Petitioners' Narrative Dramatically Strengthened):** The Chamber's brief is a powerful endorsement of the \"agency gamesmanship\" narrative. By framing the issue as one of \"clear and predictable rules\" versus agency \"manipulation,\" the Chamber elevates the dispute from a technical venue question to a fundamental issue of administrative law and checks on executive power. The fact that the nation's largest business federation felt compelled to file a brief on this procedural issue\u2014even while remaining neutral on the ultimate judgment\u2014highlights the perceived threat of the EPA's procedural tactics.\n\n6.  **Amicus Curiae Signal (Updated from Negative to Affirmative Signal):** My previous belief was based on a negative signal: the *absence* of amicus support for the EPA. This has now been updated with a powerful, albeit nuanced, affirmative signal. The key amicus brief in the case is not explicitly pro-petitioner, but is substantively pro-petitioner on the dispositive legal principles. This is arguably more powerful, as it frames the petitioners' position not as a partisan or industry-specific goal, but as a defense of neutral legal principles like predictability, textual integrity, and limits on agency discretion. The combination of no supporting briefs for the EPA and a major \"neutral\" brief that guts the EPA's legal reasoning is a resounding signal of the weakness of the government's case.\n\n7.  **Overall Confidence and Prediction (Confidence Increased to Very High):** My confidence, previously \"very high,\" is now further solidified. The Chamber of Commerce's arguments for \"administrative simplicity\" and against agency gamesmanship are tailor-made for the current Court's majority. The alignment of the petitioners' textual arguments with the Chamber's principled stand on administrative procedure creates a formidable coalition of interests and a clear, compelling path for the Court to reverse the Tenth Circuit.\n\n8.  **Epistemic State and Key Uncertainties (Primary Uncertainty Resolved):** The primary uncertainty identified in my previous belief state\u2014the nature of amicus support for the petitioners\u2014has been resolved in a highly informative way. I now have the most critical piece of information from the amicus landscape. While other, smaller amicus briefs might exist, the Chamber's brief is likely the most influential. My information-gathering priority now shifts from identifying amicus support to preparing for the substance of oral argument, where the Justices will directly test these competing interpretations.",
