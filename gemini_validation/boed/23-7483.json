      "When revoking supervised release and imposing a prison sentence, may a district court consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014namely, 'the seriousness of the offense,' 'promot[ing] respect for the law,' and 'just punishment'\u2014even though these factors are not explicitly referenced in the supervised release statute?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In January 2020, Edgardo Esteras began a six-year term of supervised release following imprisonment for drug trafficking offenses. Three years into his supervised release, in January 2023, his probation officer reported violations including domestic violence and firearm possession, though the related criminal charges were dismissed at the victim's request. At a violation hearing, Judge Pearson found that Esteras had possessed a firearm while on supervised release. Concerned that previous sentences had failed to deter him, she imposed an above-guidelines sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment plus three years of supervised release with special conditions including anger management and location monitoring. Though Esteras objected to the court\u2019s consideration of certain statutory factors related to punishment, Judge Pearson maintained that she also weighed deterrence and public safety, while acknowledging that some supervision conditions had both punitive and rehabilitative aspects.\n\nOn appeal, Esteras challenged his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on prohibited factors in sentencing him, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.",

This information is fundamental to predicting the outcome and will cause a significant update to my beliefs about the petitioner's likelihood of success. The Task EIG is therefore extremely high.

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a. The court specifically \nnoted that it varied upwards and imposed a 24-month \nprison term to, among other reasons, \u201cpromote respect for \nthe law\u201d\u2014one of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc. In response, \nthe panel issued an amended order, and the court denied \nrehearing en banc. JA 121a-135a; JA 136a-137a. The panel \nmajority reaffirmed the holding in Lewis that district \ncourts may consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. JA 128a. Two judges \npublished dissents from the order denying rehearing en \nbanc. JA 137a-149a. Esteras again petitioned for rehearing \n\n11\nen banc, which the court again denied over two published \ndissents. JA 150a-154a.\nb.\u2003 Timothy Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Jaimez \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby committing a new offense (a state misdemeanor \nfor attempted trafficking marijuana), associating with \nconvicted felons, and possessing drug paraphernalia. JA \n230a. The district court revoked his supervised release \nand sentenced him to 60 months in prison,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v.

The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A).

JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc.

Relying on Lewis \nand Esteras, the Sixth Circuit affirmed. JA 251a.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nBy omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, Congress instructed courts not to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. That is the \nonly conclusion that gives effect to the statutory text, \nincluding the text in neighboring statutes that do not omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). And it reflects Congress\u2019s goals in \ncreating supervised release, as reflected in the text, the \nhistory of the Sentencing Reform Act, and subsequent \namendments: creating a forward-looking framework for \ncourts to protect the public while assisting offenders as \nthey transition back into society.\na.\u2003 The analysis can begin and end with the text. \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when imposing supervised \nrelease and when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease. That omission was intentional, and courts may \nnot add omitted text to a statute. Additionally, at the \nsame time Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the supervised-release statute, \nit included those factors in the lists for courts to consider \nwhen imposing prison, probation, or a fine, and it included \n\n13\nthem in the list for courts to consider when modifying \nor revoking probation. Under the negative-implication \ncanon (expressio unius est exclusio alterius), Congress \nthus further instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release.\nCompare the statutes governing probation revocation \nand supervised-release revocation. Under the former, \ncourts are to consider \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03565(a). Under the latter, courts are to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Under the interpretation \nadopted by the court of appeals, that omission makes no \ndifference, and courts can consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors in either context. But giving effect to the different \nlanguage in the two provisions, the text establishes that \ncourts may not consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised release.\nb.\u2003 That conclusion also reflects the history of the \nSRA and subsequent amendments. Through the SRA, \nCongress abolished indeterminant sentencing and \nthe practice of using prison to attempt to rehabilitate \noffenders before releasing them on parole. It created \nsupervised release as a new discretionary supplement \nto a fixed prison term, used to encourage rehabilitation \nand assist newly released inmates as they transition back \ninto society. Reflecting Congress\u2019s rehabilitative goals, \nthe original statute did not even provide a mechanism for \nrevoking supervised release aside from a new prosecution \nfor criminal contempt or a separate offense. And, as \n\n14\nit does to this day, the statute instructed courts not to \nconsider retribution when modifying supervised release \nby omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of factors \nfor courts to consider.\nSubsequent amendments have reaffirmed Congress\u2019s \nnonretributive goals for supervised release. When \nCongress amended the supervised-release statute to \nadd a revocation mechanism, it maintained the list that \nexcluded Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. And \nCongress has three times amended the statute since then \nto add other forward-looking factors for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. It has added Section 3553(a)(2)(C) (the \nneed to protect the public) and (a)(7) (the need to provide \nrestitution), but not Section 3553(a)(2)(A).\nc.\u2003 The interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nposes constitutional problems. As this Court has said, \nconstruing revocation and subsequent imprisonment as \npunishment for violating supervised-release conditions \nwould raise serious constitutional questions regarding, \nfor example, the jury-trial right and double-jeopardy \nprotection. But the decisions below allow courts to do \nexactly that.\nd.\u2003 Applying the text as written is not \u201cunworkable,\u201d \nas the court of appeals said. Excluding the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors allows courts to consider all relevant \ninformation when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, filtered through only the purposes of sentencing \nthat Congress has determined apply in that context: \ndeterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but not \nretribution. Courts must consider only those purposes \n\n15\nwhen imposing supervised release, adopting conditions \nthat it deems appropriate for protecting the public while \nassisting the defendant as he or she transitions back into \nsociety. And courts must consider only those purposes \nwhen modifying or revoking supervising release, using \nadditional time in custody, if necessary, as a tool to protect \nthe public or compel the defendant into complying with the \nconditions imposed. If the defendant\u2019s conduct is criminal \nand warrants retributive punishment, a new prosecution is \nthe mechanism, not a revocation sentence. Nothing about \nthis framework is unworkable.\nARGUMENT\nI.\t The plain text of Section 3583 and neighboring \nstatutes dictates that Congress precluded courts \nfrom considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when imposing, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe statutory text alone resolves the question \npresented. Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nSection 3583\u2019s lists of factors for courts to consider when \nimposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking supervised \nrelease. Because courts may not add omitted text to a \nstatute, that omission precludes courts from considering \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Moreover, while omitting \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from the supervised-release statute, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when listing \nfactors for courts to consider in other contexts. Applying \nthe negative-implication canon, and giving effect to the \ndifferent text in different provisions of the SRA, the \nomission in Section 3583(e) thus bars consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors.\n\n16\na.\u2003 Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nthe list of factors for courts to consider when imposing \nsupervised release and when terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release. That omission was \nintentional, and courts may not add omitted text to the \nstatute. The plain text of Section 3583 thus precludes \ncourts from considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors.\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory \ninterpretation that \u2018absent provision[s] cannot be supplied \nby the courts.\u2019\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019) \n(quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 (2012)). \nAdding omitted provisions \u201c\u2018is not a construction of the \nstatute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court.\u2019\u201d \nNichols v. United States, 578 U.S. 104, 110 (2016) (quoting \nIselin v. United States, 270 U.S. 245, 251 (1926)). \u201c\u2018To \nsupply omissions transcends the judicial function.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting Iselin, 270 U.S. at 251).\nIn 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), Congress set forth factors for \ncourts to consider when deciding what sentence to impose. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a). Subsection (a)(2) requires courts \nto consider:\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003 to reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide \njust punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n\n17\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further crimes \nof the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner[.]\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2). The subsection (a)(2) factors \ncorrespond to \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and \nrehabilitation,\u201d which are \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally.\u201d Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 325 (2011).\nSection 3583(c) lists factors from Section 3553(a) for \ncourts to consider when imposing supervised release: \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list.1\nThrough that omission, Congress instructed courts to \nconsider the listed factors, and not Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors, when imposing supervised release. \nThis Court has said as much. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326 \n(\u201cThese provisions make clear that a particular purpose \nmay apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind \nof sentence under consideration. For example, a court may \nnot take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release. \n1.\u2002 Congress also omitted Section 3553(a)(3), \u201cthe kinds of \nsentences available,\u201d from the list of factors in Section 3583(c). \nWhen a court is considering whether to impose supervised release \nfollowing a prison term, supervised release is the only sentence \navailable. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a).\n\n18\nSee \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\u201d (emphasis in original)); see also Concepcion \nv. United States, 597 U.S. 481, 495 (2022) (same). So has \nthe Government. See Reply Brief for the United States, \nTapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 (2011) (No. 10-5400), \n2011 U.S. S.\u00a0Ct. Briefs LEXIS 451, *20 (\u201cSection 3583(c) \nexplicitly lists each Section 3553(a) factor that courts \nmust consider and omits the factors whose consideration \nCongress intended to preclude. See 18 U.S.C. 3583(c).\u201d).\nSimilarly, Section 3583(e) lists factors from Section \n3553(a) for courts to consider when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release. The list is the \nsame as Section 3583(c): \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Congress omitted Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) from that list as well.2\nJust as omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list \nof factors in Section 3583(c) means that courts may not \nconsider those factors when imposing supervised release, \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 326, so does the same omission in \nSection 3583(e) mean that courts may not consider \nthose factors when terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. \u201cThe statute says what it says\u2014or \nperhaps better put here, does not say what it does not \nsay.\u201d Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees Ret.

Miqbel, 444 F.3d \n1173, 1182 (9th Cir. 2006) (same).\nb.\u2003\nThe differences between Section 3583 and \nneighboring provisions confirm this conclusion. When \nCongress listed factors for courts to consider when \nsentencing a defendant, it included Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing prison, probation, or a \nfine, but not when imposing supervised release. Likewise, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking probation, \nbut not when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nUnder the principle of expressio unius est exclusio \nalterius, the negative-implication canon, Congress thus \ninstructed courts not to consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when imposing supervised release under Section \n3583(c) or when modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e). Applying this principle is the only \nway to give effect to the different language Congress used \nin the different sections of the SRA.\n\u201cWhen Congress includes particular language in \none section of a statute but omits it from a neighbor, [this \nCourt] normally understand[s] that difference in language \nto convey a difference in meaning (expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius).\u201d Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. \n85, 94 (2023). The Court has referred to this principle as \n\u201can ancient maxim,\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974), and a \n\u201ctraditional rule of statutory construction,\u201d Bittner, 598 \n\n20\nU.S. at 94. It has special force where, as here, \u201cCongress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act.\u201d Russello \nv. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, \n498 U.S. 395, 404-05 (1991) (same).\nCongress drafted and enacted the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, and has amended it since, against \nthis background. The SRA directs judges to sentence \nall defendants to prison, probation, or a fine, and allows \njudges to impose a fine in addition to prison or probation. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03551(b) & (c). The Act permits judges to \nimpose supervised release to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a). And it specifies which factors apply \nto the different sentencing options, instructing courts to \nconsider:\n\u2022\t for prison, \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, \nrecognizing that imprisonment is not an \nappropriate means of promoting correction \nand rehabilitation,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a);\n\u2022\t for fines, eight listed factors \u201cin addition to \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a);\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cthe factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cthe factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n\n21\n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(c).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nin neighboring statutes but not in Section 3583(c), Congress \ninstructed courts not to consider those factors when \nimposing supervised release. That conclusion flows from \na straightforward application of the negative-implication \ncanon.

When imposing \nand when modifying or revoking supervised release, \nthough, the statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). If courts could \nnevertheless consider the (a)(2)(A) factors in supervised-\nrelease-revocation proceedings, as the court of appeals \nconcluded, the probation and supervised-release statutes \nwould mean the same thing: consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors to the extent that they apply.\nThis Court should \u201crefrain from concluding here \nthat the differing language in the two [provisions] has \nthe same meaning in each.\u201d Russello, 464 U.S. at 23. \nApplying the negative-implication canon and giving effect \nto the language in each provision of the SRA, the text \ndictates that courts may not consider Section 3553(a)\n\n23\n(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nII.\t The history of the Sentencing Reform Act and \nsubsequent amendments further demonstrates \nthat Congress intended to preclude courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease.\nAlthough the text alone demonstrates that Section \n3583(e) bars courts from considering the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, the history of the SRA and later amendments \nto Section 3583 confirms this understanding. Congress \ncreated supervised release to promote rehabilitation \nafter a prison term. Subsequent amendments reaffirmed \nCongress\u2019s forward-looking goals, tasking courts with \nmanaging a person\u2019s transition back into society after \nserving their punishment. The revocation provision serves \nthose same goals, giving the sentencing court a tool to \ncompel compliance with the conditions it has determined \nnecessary to rehabilitate the offender and protect the \npublic, but not to impose backward-looking retributive \npunishment.\na.\u2003 For most of the 20th century, federal criminal \nconvictions yielded indeterminate sentences. Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 363 (1989). Judges imposed \nprison terms, but parole officials could order a person\u2019s \nrelease after serving one-third of the stated term. Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 323. \u201cBoth indeterminate sentencing and \nparole were based on concepts of the offender\u2019s possible, \nindeed probable, rehabilitation, a view that it was realistic \n\n24\nto attempt to rehabilitate the inmate and thereby to \nminimize the risk that he would resume criminal activity \nupon his return to society.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 364.\nOver time, Congress abandoned that view. \n\u201cRehabilitation as a sound penological theory came to be \nquestioned and, in any event, was regarded by some as an \nunattainable goal for most cases.\u201d Id. at 365. \u201cLawmakers \nand others increasingly doubted that prison programs \ncould \u2018rehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u2019\u2014or \nthat parole officers could \u2018determine accurately whether \nor when a particular prisoner had been rehabilitated.\u2019\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 324 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 40 \n(1983)).\nCongress responded by enacting the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987. \nThe SRA \u201coverhauled federal sentencing procedures to \nmake prison terms more determinate and abolish the \npractice of parole.\u201d United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. \n634, 651 (2019) (plurality op.). It requires sentencing \njudges to impose prison, probation, or a fine for every \nperson convicted of a federal offense. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03551. And, consistent with Congress\u2019s changed view \non rehabilitation, the SRA instructs judges imposing \nprison terms to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not \nan appropriate means of promoting correction and \nrehabilitation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a). This provision bars \ncourts \u201cfrom imposing or lengthening a prison term in \norder to promote a criminal defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 321.\nHaving eliminated parole, Congress created \nsupervised release as \u201ca unique method of post-confinement \n\n25\nsupervision.\u201d Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S. at 407. Unlike \nparole, a supervised-release term is a separate part of \nthe sentence, imposed at the judge\u2019s discretion, to follow a \ndeterminate prison term. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c); S. Rep. \nNo. 98-225, at 123 (1983); Fiona Doherty, Indeterminate \nSentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised \nRelease, 88 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 958, 998 (2013). And unlike \nparole, \u201csupervised release wasn\u2019t introduced to replace a \nportion of the defendant\u2019s prison term, only to encourage \nrehabilitation after the completion of his prison term.\u201d \nHaymond, 588 U.S. at 652 (plurality op.) (emphasis in \noriginal); see also Johnson, 529 U.S. at 59 (\u201cCongress \nintended supervised release to assist individuals in \ntheir transition to community life. Supervised release \nfulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served \nby incarceration.\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201c[T]he \nprimary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s \ntransition into the community after the service of a long \nprison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide \nrehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short \nperiod in prison for punishment or other purposes but still \nneeds supervision and training programs after release.\u201d).\nThe SRA\u2019s text reflects Congress\u2019s different goals \nfor the different sentencing provisions. To punish the \noffender, Congress instructed courts to impose prison, \nprobation, or a fine for every offense. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nAnd when imposing any of these sanctions, Congress \ninstructed courts to consider all the Section 3553(a)(2) \nfactors, including the retribution factors in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A): the need for the sentence to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (prison); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a) (fine).\n\n26\nReflecting the rehabilitative goals of supervised \nrelease, though, the SRA instructed courts imposing \nsupervised release not to consider the retribution or \nincapacitation factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) or (C), \nby intentionally omitting those provisions from Section \n3583(c)\u2019s list of factors for courts to consider.3 See \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at \n1999; S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201cThe Committee has \nconcluded that the sentencing purposes of incapacitation \nand punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release.\u201d). And Congress used the same list, \nreflecting the same goals, when instructing courts what \nto consider when addressing a violation of supervised \nrelease. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 \nStat. at 2000; see also S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (noting \nthat Section 3583(e) directs the court to \u201cconsider[ ] the \nsame factors considered in the original imposition of a \nterm of supervised release\u201d).\nComparing supervised release with probation is again \ninstructive. Because judges may select probation as the \ncomplete sentence for an offense, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551, \nCongress instructed courts to consider all the applicable \nSection 3553(a) factors when imposing it, see Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a0 3562(a), 98 Stat. at 1992. But \nbecause supervised release follows a prison sentence that \nthe sentencing court has concluded satisfies the Section \n3553(a) factors, and because supervised release is a \ndiscretionary supplement that fulfills more limited goals, \nCongress instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3.\u2002 Congress has since amended Section 3583(c) to add Section \n3553(a)(2)(C), the need to protect the public, as a permissible factor. \nSee infra Section II.d.\n\n27\n3553(a)(2)(A) or (C) factors. See Sentencing Reform Act \nof 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at 1999; see also S. Rep. No. \n98-225, at 125 (\u201cThe term of supervised release is very \nsimilar to a term of probation, except that it follows a term \nof imprisonment and may not be imposed for purposes of \npunishment or incapacitation since those purposes will \nhave been served to the extent necessary by the term of \nimprisonment.\u201d).\nThe same distinction between probation and supervised \nrelease applies to modification and revocation. Historically, \na probation sentence was based on \u201csuspend[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. \na defendant\u2019s prescribed prison term and afford[ing] \nhim a conditional liberty as an \u2018act of grace,\u2019 subject to \nrevocation.\u201d Haymond, 588 U.S. at 643 (plurality op.). \nThe SRA retained from prior practice that probation \n\u201cremains conditional and subject to revocation until its \nexpiration or termination.\u201d Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03564(e), 98 Stat. at 1994. Thus, for a probation \nviolation, the SRA instructed courts to consider all the \napplicable Section 3553(a) factors and allowed courts to \neither modify the term or revoke probation and conduct \na plenary resentencing. See Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03565(a), 98 Stat. at 1995. For supervised release, \nin contrast, the SRA restricted what factors courts \nmay consider\u2014including precluding consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors\u2014and limited \ncourts\u2019 options for addressing a violation. See Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at 2000. Those \ntextual differences convey different meanings that reflect \nCongress\u2019s different goals.\nThis Court has recognized the differences between \nprobation and supervised release in the SRA. United \n\n28\nStates v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 50 (1994) (\u201cSupervised \nrelease, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in \nlieu of incarceration.\u201d). It has also refused to construe \n\u201cdifferently worded probation and supervised release \nrevocation provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. in pari materia.\u201d Id. at 51. It \nshould refuse to do so here as well.\nb.\u2003\nConsistent with the rehabilitative goals of \nsupervised release, the SRA originally did not include \nrevocation as an option for a court to address a violation. \nAs first enacted, Section 3583(e) stated that a court \u201cmay, \nafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\n(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6),\u201d terminate \nsupervised release, modify the conditions, or \u201ctreat a \nviolation of a condition of a term of supervised release as \ncontempt of court pursuant to section 401(3) of this title.\u201d \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at \n2000. If a violation constituted a new criminal offense, the \ndefendant could also be prosecuted for that offense. See S. \nRep. No. 98-225, at 125. Once charged with contempt or \nanother offense, the defendant was entitled to full criminal \ndue-process protections, including the right to a jury trial \nif facing imprisonment for more than six months. See Int\u2019l \nUnion, Mine Works of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 826-\n27 (1994). If convicted, the defendant would face a new \nsentencing hearing where the court could consider all \nthe relevant sentencing factors, including the retribution \nfactors under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nBut the SRA did not provide a truncated proceeding by \nwhich a court could impose time in custody for violating \nsupervised-release conditions. See Doherty, supra, at \n999-1000.\nThe original structure of the SRA thus confirms again \nthat, when Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \n\n29\nthe list in Section 3583(e), it meant to instruct courts not \nto consider those factors. When considering whether \nto terminate or modify supervised release, retributive \npunishment was beside the point, and the court could \nconsider only the listed factors. Only after a separate \nconviction for criminal contempt or a new offense would \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) come back into play.\nc.\u2003 Before the SRA took effect, Congress amended \nSection 3583(e) to add a revocation option. Even then, it \ndid not amend Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors for courts to \nconsider and thus reaffirmed that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors remained impermissible.\nThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 added new \nparagraph (4) to Section 3583(e), permitting a court to:\nrevoke a term of supervised release, and \nrequire the person to serve in prison all or \npart of the term of supervised release without \ncredit for time previously served on postrelease \nsupervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person violated a condition of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nthat are applicable to probation revocation and \nto the provisions of applicable policy statements \nissued by the Sentencing Commission.\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, \n\u00a7\u00a0 1006(a)(3)(D), 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-7. Congress later \ndeleted paragraph (3) and its reference to criminal \ncontempt. See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. \nNo. 100-690, tit. VII, \u00a7\u00a07108(b)(3), 100 Stat. 4181, 4419. \n\n30\nNeither amendment added Section 3553(a)(2)(A) to Section \n3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to consider.\nAlthough the 1986 amendment provided a more direct \nprocedure to imprison those who violated supervised-\nrelease conditions, it did not indicate that retribution was \na permissible consideration. By continuing Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) as an omitted factor in Section 3583(e)\u2019s list, the 1986 \namendment maintained the prior meaning of that omission \nand provided further evidence that Congress did not \nintend Section 3583(e) to include retributive punishment. \nThe statute continued to \u201csay[ ] what it says\u2014or perhaps \nbetter put here .\u00a0.\u00a0. not say what it does not say.\u201d Cyan, \nInc., 583 U.S. at 426.\nd.\u2003 Since the SRA took effect in 1987, Congress has \nrepeatedly amended Section 3583 to revise the factors for \ncourts to consider when imposing, terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release, but it has never added \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. The Sentencing \nAct of 1987 added Section 3553(a)(2)(C), the need to \nprotect the public, as a factor listed in Section 3583(c) \nfor courts to consider when imposing supervised release. \nSee Sentencing Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-182, \u00a7\u00a09, 101 \nStat. 1266, 1267. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 added \nthe same provision to Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to \nconsider when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nSee Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690,  tit. \nVII, \u00a7 7108(b)(1), 100 Stat. at 4419. And in 2002, Congress \nadded Section 3553(a)(7), the need to provide restitution, to \nboth Section 3583(c) and (e). See 21st Century Department \nof Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. \n107-273, div. B, tit. III, \u00a7\u00a03007, 116 Stat. 1758, 1806 (2002).\n\n31\nCongress thus has shown repeatedly that it adds \nfactors to Section 3583(c) and (e) when it means to \ninstruct courts to consider those factors. None of those \namendments would be necessary if, as the court of appeals \nheld, Sections 3583(c) and (e) already permitted courts to \nconsider any Section 3553(a) factor.\nIII.\tThe interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nwould raise serious constitutional questions.\nConstruing Section 3583(e) as the court of appeals did \nwould threaten to violate the Constitution. If left to stand, \nthe decisions below would allow district courts to impose \nretributive punishment for violating supervised-release \nconditions. As this Court has observed, \u201cconstruing \nrevocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release\u201d would \nraise \u201cserious constitutional questions.\u201d Johnson v. United \nStates, 529 U.S. 694, 700 (2000). For one, \u201cviolative conduct \nneed not be criminal and need only be found by a judge \nunder a preponderance of the evidence standard, not by a \njury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.; see also Haymond, \n588 U.S. at 650 (plurality op.) (\u201cIf the government were \nright, a jury\u2019s conviction on one crime would .\u00a0.\u00a0. permit \nperpetual supervised release and allow the government to \nevade the need for another jury trial on any other offense \nthe defendant might commit, no matter how grave the \npunishment.\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0841 (authorizing a supervised \nrelease term of up to life for distributing any amount of \na controlled substance in schedules I through IV). Also, \n\u201c[w]here the acts of violation are criminal in their own \nright, they may be the basis for separate prosecution, \nwhich would raise an issue of double jeopardy if the \nrevocation of supervised release were also punishment \nfor the same offense.\u201d Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.\n\n32\n\u201cTreating postrevocation sanctions as part of the \npenalty for the initial offense, however (as most courts \nhave done), avoids these difficulties.\u201d Id. But the same \ndifficulties arise if courts expressly impose retributive \npunishment for a violation, as happened here. See JA 244a. \nThe statute as written raises no such problems. As the \ntext dictates and as Congress intended, Section 3583(e) \nprecludes courts from considering the retribution factors \nin Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.\nIV.\tIn the plain text of Section 3583(e), Congress \nprovided a workable, forward-looking framework \nfor courts to follow when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe court of appeals concluded that it would be \n\u201cunworkable\u201d for courts to avoid considering Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors both when imposing \nsupervised release and when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See JA 128a, 130a. That is mistaken.\nTake Section 3583(c) first, which governs what factors \ncourts may consider when imposing supervised release. \nApplying the text\u2019s plain meaning, courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release. The court of appeals suggested this \nwould be possible only if the judge \u201cadjourn[ed] the \nhearing after imposing a sentence,\u201d then \u201cstart[ed] over \nwith a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release.\u201d JA 130a. It reasoned that \u201cCongress \ncould not have expected courts to wipe their minds of \nthese concerns when they move from one type of sentence \nto the other.\u201d Id.\n\n33\nThis Court has twice said otherwise. See Concepcion, \n597 U.S. at 495; Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326. Nothing about \nthat is unworkable. Judges are well able to apply different \nconsiderations for different purposes. Cf. Williams v. \nIllinois, 567 U.S. 50, 69 (2012) (\u201cWhen the judge sits \nas the trier of fact, it is presumed that the judge will \nunderstand the limited reason for the disclosure of the \nunderlying inadmissible information and will not rely on \nthat information for any improper purpose.\u201d). And other \ncourts of appeals have laid out workable guidelines for \nensuring that sentencing courts differentiate between \ntheir reasons for prison and for supervised release. See, \ne.g., United States v. Wilcher, 91 F.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. \n2024) (\u201cTo help navigate this area, we have encouraged \ndistrict courts to separate out their discussions of prison \ntime and supervised release when the reason for imposing \none cannot apply to the other.\u201d); United States v. Burden, \n860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that, when a court \nbases its prison sentence substantially on the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \u201cit would be advisable for the \ndistrict court to separately state its reasons for the term \nof supervised release imposed\u201d).\nConcerning modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e), the court of appeals said that \ndisregarding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would be \nunworkable in a different way\u2014because \u201cthe purportedly \nforbidden considerations mentioned in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \ntend to be essentially redundant with the permitted \nones.\u201d JA 128a (internal quotation marks omitted). But \nthat reasoning proves the opposite, and it highlights the \nimportance of applying the text as written, consistent with \nCongress\u2019s intent. If other factors address much of what \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) covers, there is little reason to rely \n\n34\non the (a)(2)(A) factors. And what (a)(2)(A) covers that is \nnot covered by the other factors is crucial: factors related \nto retributive punishment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \n(\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d); Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 325 (noting that Section 3553(a)(2)(A) reflects \nretribution as a purpose of sentencing).\nExcluding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors thus allows \ncourts to consider all relevant information, but filtered \nthrough only the purposes of sentencing that Congress has \ndetermined apply when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease: deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but \nnot retribution. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325. For example, \ncourts may consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the \noffense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(1), as it relates to any other \npermissible factor. But the seriousness of the offense, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), is not the same as the nature and \ncircumstances, and Congress distinguished between the \ntwo by placing them in separate subsections in Section \n3553(a). See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 778 \n(1988) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting the \u201ccardinal rule \nof statutory interpretation that no provision should be \nconstrued to be entirely redundant\u201d). The nature and \ncircumstances of the offense may relate to any sentencing \npurpose; in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), seriousness relates to \nretributive punishment. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325; Miqbel, \n444 F.3d at 1182 (noting that the need to promote respect \nfor the law and reflect the seriousness of the offense \u201cis \noften intertwined with the concept of punishment, as it is \nin \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) itself \u201d). Congress excluded the latter, \nand any overlap between Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and the \nother factors makes it all the more important for courts to \n\n35\navoid relying on the impermissible consideration inherent \nto (a)(2)(A): retributive punishment.\nNothing about Section 3583(c) or (e) as written is \nunworkable. District courts simply must rely only on the \nlisted factors, fulfilling Congress\u2019s forward-looking goals \nfor supervised release. Retributive punishment is an \ninherently backward-looking analysis, examining what a \nperson did and determining what sanction is appropriate \nin retribution. Supervised release is a forward-looking \nproject, giving courts tools to manage a person\u2019s transition \nback into society by imposing conditions to rehabilitate the \noffender and protect the public. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nSection 3583(e) gives courts an additional tool to compel \ncompliance with those conditions, allowing modification \nor revocation based on those same goals\u2014for example, \nto provide needed correctional treatment, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(D), or to protect the public from further \noffenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(C). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). \nViewing supervised release as a forward-looking project, \nas Congress intended, does not present courts with an \nunworkable task. It reflects Congress\u2019s statutory design, \nand courts \u201cmust implement the design Congress chose.\u201d \nLora v. United States, 599 U.S. 453, 464 (2023).\nThis Court should give effect to the SRA\u2019s text and \nhold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) precludes district courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDecember 2024\nJoseph Medici\nFederal Public Defender,\nSouthern District of Ohio\nKevin M.

          "task_beliefs": "I previously had no specific knowledge about the legal facts, precedents, or arguments in this case, recognizing the need to gather information.\n\nMy understanding has now been significantly refined. I have identified the central legal question in *Edgardo Esteras, Petitioner v. United States* as a specific issue of statutory interpretation. The conflict centers on the relationship between the general federal sentencing statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the statute governing the revocation of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).\n\nThe core of the dispute is whether a district court, when imposing a prison sentence after revoking supervised release, is permitted to consider the traditionally retributive factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014namely, 'the seriousness of the offense,' 'promot[ing] respect for the law,' and providing 'just punishment'. The legal tension arises because \u00a7 3583(e) explicitly cross-references and requires consideration of *some* factors from \u00a7 3553(a), but it notably omits the retributive factors from subsection (a)(2)(A).\n\nThis framing allows me to anticipate the primary arguments: the petitioner will likely argue that the omission was intentional and therefore prohibitive (an *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* argument), while the respondent will likely argue that the omission does not constitute a prohibition and that courts retain their traditional discretion or that other statutory language permits consideration of these factors. My knowledge has progressed from a state of complete ignorance to a precise understanding of the legal battleground. Predicting the outcome will depend on analyzing how the Court will interpret the statutory silence in \u00a7 3583(e).",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially deepened by analyzing the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits. My previous belief, which correctly identified the core statutory conflict between 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and \u00a7 3583(e) and anticipated an *expressio unius* argument, has now been validated and enriched with specific legal architecture and precedent.\n\nThe new information confirms that the petitioner's primary argument is indeed a textualist one, centered on Congress's deliberate omission of the retributive factors from \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in the list of factors for supervised release revocation in \u00a7 3583(e). My belief about how to predict the outcome is now more refined, as I can see the petitioner is not relying on a single argument but a multi-pronged strategy that will require the Court to engage with several distinct legal doctrines.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Confirmation and Elaboration of the Core Textual Argument:** The petitioner's brief confirms that the central argument is that the omission of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors from \u00a7 3583(e) was a deliberate act by Congress to *preclude* their consideration. This argument is strengthened by a direct structural comparison to the probation revocation statute, \u00a7 3565(a), which *does* include the retributive factors. This direct statutory contrast is a powerful piece of evidence for the *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* canon and will be a key point for the Court to analyze.\n\n2.  **Identification of Key Precedents:** I now know the specific precedents that form the foundation of the petitioner's case.\n    *   ***Tapia v. United States* (2011) is the central pillar.** The petitioner frames this case as a direct parallel to *Tapia*, where the Court held that a similar statutory omission precluded courts from imposing prison time for rehabilitative purposes. This precedent provides a strong analogical basis for their argument.\n    *   ***Russello v. United States* (1983) is cited for the core interpretive canon** that when Congress includes language in one section but omits it in another, the omission is presumed to be intentional.\n    *   **Recent textualist sentencing cases like *Lora v. United States* (2023) and *Bittner v. United States* (2023)** are leveraged to align the petitioner's argument with the current Court's demonstrated preference for close textual and structural analysis.\n\n3.  **Addition of a Constitutional Avoidance Argument:** The petitioner introduces a significant secondary argument that I had not previously considered: constitutional avoidance. They argue that interpreting \u00a7 3583(e) to allow for retributive punishment based on conduct not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt would raise serious constitutional questions under the Sixth Amendment and Double Jeopardy clause, citing *United States v. Haymond* (2019). This argument provides an alternative path for justices to rule in the petitioner's favor, even if they are not fully persuaded by the primary textualist claim.\n\n4.  **Understanding the Legislative Purpose:** The brief argues that the legislative history of the Sentencing Reform Act shows Congress intended supervised release to be a forward-looking, rehabilitative tool, distinct from the backward-looking, punitive nature of the original prison sentence. This purposivist argument complements the textualist one by providing a rationale for *why* Congress would have intentionally omitted the retributive factors.\n\nIn sum, my belief state has evolved from a correct but general hypothesis to a detailed, evidence-based understanding of the petitioner's specific legal strategy. I now see that predicting the outcome requires not just evaluating a single statutory interpretation question, but assessing the interplay between textualism (*Tapia*, *Russello*), legislative purpose, and constitutional avoidance (*Haymond*). The strength of the petitioner's case appears greater than I initially estimated, given the direct parallel to *Tapia* and the powerful statutory contrast with the probation statute. My focus now shifts to how the government will attempt to distinguish *Tapia* and explain away the clear textual differences in the statutory scheme.",

The petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was filed on May 15, 2024.  Cf. Sup. Ct. R. 12.4.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, each petitioner \nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be followed by a term \nof supervised release.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated \none or more terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and imposed a term of \nimprisonment.  Pet. App. 14a-18a, 59a, 76a.  In each case, the \ncourt of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 4a-13a, 53a-58a, 74a-75a. \n1. \na. \nIn 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Pet. App. 5a.  The \n\n3 \n \ndistrict court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of imprisonment, \nconsecutive to a 15-month prison term for violating his probation \nfor a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, to be followed by \nsix years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn January 2020, Esteras began serving his six-year term of \nsupervised release.  Pet. App. 5a.  In January 2023, the Probation \nOffice reported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing domestic vio-\nlence, aggravated menacing, and criminal damaging in violation of \nstate law, and (2) possessing a firearm.  Id. at 5a, 16a.  The \nreport stated that, on January 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the \nmother of his children in the head at her residence; stormed out \nto his vehicle; and, after the victim followed him and attempted \nto grab his car keys, pointed a handgun at her, threated to kill \nher, and fired three rounds from his handgun into her vehicle.  \nId. at 15a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, 4:14-cr-425 D. Ct. Doc. 439 \n(June 22, 2023) (transcript), the district court found that Esteras \nhad \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d in the manner that the victim \nhad described to the police, as memorialized in body-camera video \nevidence.  Id. at 80; see Pet. App. 16a-17a & n.1.  The court noted \nthat it \u201csuspect[ed]\u201d that Esteras\u2019s conduct satisfied \u201cthe ele-\nments\u201d of the state-law violations reported, but was not suffi-\nciently versed in the state-law provisions to be certain.  Pet. \n\n4 \n \nApp. 37a.  But the court explained that \u201cit really d[id]n\u2019t matter\u201d \nand determined that, whether or not Esteras had violated state \nlaw, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervision by possessing a \n[firearm].\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 17a. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3), a district court that determines \nthat a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release \n\u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7),\u201d revoke the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and \norder reimprisonment.  The provisions of Section 3553(a) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) cross-references set forth a number of factors to \nconsider in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the sentence \nimposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \u201cprotect the public,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); the need to \u201cprovide the defendant \nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or \nother correctional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); the sen-\ntencing range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(4); pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need to pro-\nvide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7).  Section 3583(e) \ndoes not expressly cross-reference Section 3553(a)(2)(A), which \n\n5 \n \naddresses \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed * * * to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to \nprovide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for Esteras\u2019s  \nsupervised-release violation, the district court recounted his \nprior federal offenses, noted that he was \u201cno stranger to federal \ncourt\u201d or to \u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to encourage \n[him] to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a-39a.  And after recounting the circumstances surrounding \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation and observing that it was \n\u201cnot really sure what it will require for [Esteras] to learn that \nenough is enough,\u201d the court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary upwards\u201d \nfrom the Guidelines recommendation because Esteras\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d \nand \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typical\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d \nand \u201cmust stop.\u201d  Id. at 39a-41a. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of \nfactors identified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), including the need to \npromote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of, \nand provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] the offense.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-\n48a.  The court noted in response stated that its revocation term \nwas based in part \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and to \u201cdeter[]\u201d \nEsteras, but that it also rested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the \n\n6 \n \nsafety of the community\u201d and its desire to distinguish Esteras \nfrom a \u201ctypical\u201d defendant.  Id. at 48a.  In a subsequent written \norder (id. at 14a-18a), the district court observed that it had \nconsidered the factors in Section 3553(a) and 3583(d), and stated \nthat its revocation determination was based, \u201camong other rea-\nsons,\u201d on the need \u201cto protect society and promote respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 17a-18a; see 18 U.S.C. 3553(d) (addressing imposition \nof conditions of supervised release). \nb. \nThe court of appeals initially affirmed the supervised-\nrelease-revocation judgment in an unpublished order.  Pet. App. \n1a-3a.  The court later amended and reissued the order as a pub-\nlished disposition.  Id. at 4a-13a. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s argument that the \ndistrict court had improperly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) fac-\ntors when imposing a term of imprisonment after revoking his su-\npervised release.  Pet. App. 6a-13a.  The court observed that, \nunder its previous decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008), the dis-\ntrict court permissibly considered Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s fac-\ntors.  Pet. App. 8a.  The court highlighted Lewis\u2019s observation \nthat, as a \u201ctextual\u201d matter, Section 3583(e) requires a district \ncourt to \u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d before making supervised-\nrelease decisions but that, unlike other sentencing provisions, \nSection 3583(e) \u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nthose factors.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court also high-\nlighted Lewis\u2019s concern that a \u201cproposed bright-line rule\u201d for-\nbidding consideration of Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas un-\nworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations men-\ntioned in [Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals also offered several examples illustrat-\ning that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is unworkable,\u201d \nPet. App. 9a.  See id. at 8a-10a.  First, the court observed that \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201c\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u201d factor -- \nwhich Esteras argued could not be considered -- \u201caligns with [Sec-\ntion] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u2018the nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u2019\u201d which Section 3583(e) expressly requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  Id. at 8a-9a.  Second, the court \nstated that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed \u2018to promote respect for \nthe law\u2019\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the rationale that revoking super-\nvised release will \u2018help\u2019 the defendant \u2018learn to obey the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 9a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors the other,\u201d \nnoting that the district court judge \u201cquite understandably could \nnot see how she could ignore respect for the law but consider a \ndefendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised release.\u201d  \nIbid.  Third, the court of appeals observed that Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\n\n8 \n \nleled considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the district \ncourt to consider.  Ibid.  More specifically, the court explained \nthat a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to Section 3553(a)(5)\u2019s re-\nquirement to consider various \u201c\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of \nthe Sentencing Commission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose \na revocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned by \nthe original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the conduct that \nviolated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals additionally stated that the view that \nSection 3583(e) lists the only permissible factors that may inform \na revocation term was \u201cunworkable in another way\u201d:  Section 3583(c) \nincludes the same set of factors that are listed in Section 3583(e) \nas considerations for a district court in initially imposing a \nterm of supervised release at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing.  \nPet. App. 6a, 9a; see id. at 8a (observing that \u201cEsteras claims \nthat [Section] 3583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations\u201d).  The court \nstated that \u201cCongress could not have expected courts\u201d at an initial \nsentencing \u201cto wipe their minds of\u201d more expansive sentencing \n\u201cconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, \nand nothing in the statute requires such compartmentalization.\u201d  \nId. at 9a-10a. \nFinally, the court of appeals observed that its \u201cunderstand-\ning of [Section] 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other \n\n9 \n \ncircuits and the outcomes of all of them.\u201d  Pet. App. 11a.  The \ncourt explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that courts may invoke \nfactors related to the three general considerations in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sen-\ntence,\u201d and that the circuits that have \u201cdescribed the [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still \nrecognize that they may play supporting roles in a district court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d such that \u201c[e]ven under these decisions,\u201d the district \ncourt here \u201cacted properly.\u201d  Id. at 11a-12a. \nc. \nOn the same day that the panel issued its amended order, \nthe court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Pet. App. 19a-29a.  \nJudge Moore dissented from the denial, on the view that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 21a-27a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehearing was warranted, but \ndid not state that the panel had erred.  Id. at 28a-29a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition for re-\nhearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  Pet. App. 30a-34a.  Judge \nMoore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated her belief that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 32a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudges Stranch and Bloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing \nwas warranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  Id. \nat 33a-34a. \n2. \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police of-\nficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun under his \n\n10 \n \nseat with three (15-, 20- and 30-round-capacity) magazines con-\ntaining 21 rounds of ammunition.  1:19-cr-283 D. Ct. Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 7-\n14 (Dec. 23, 2019) (Presentence Investigation Report).  Leaks \npleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  Pet. App. \n74a.  The district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of impris-\nonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks began serving his term of supervised \nrelease.  23-3547 Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including a state unlawful-firearm-\npossession offense and a state robbery offense to which Leaks had \npleaded guilty and had been sentenced, respectively, to three years \nand four to six years of imprisonment.  Pet. App. 74a, 80a-81a.  \nLeaks subsequently admitted to committing five supervised-release \nviolations: the two state-law crimes just noted, failing to report \nfor supervision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work towards a GED.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a.  The district \ncourt accordingly found that Leaks had violated the terms of his \nsupervised release.  Id. at 81a.  Leaks then acknowledged through \ncounsel that \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute to impose a \nterm of imprisonment\u201d given \u201cthe nature of [Leaks\u2019s] violation\u201d \nbut requested that the court run the term of imprisonment concur-\n\n11 \n \nrent with, not consecutive to, the state-court sentences for his \nstate-law violations.  Id. at 82a. \nBefore making its supervised-release revocation determina-\ntion, the district court noted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] \noffense\u201d for which supervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine \ngun\u201d and that Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The court also noted that Leaks had \ncommitted a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on supervised release.  \nIbid.  And the court agreed with \u201call of the statements made by \n[government counsel],\u201d ibid., who had noted that Sentencing Guide-\nline 7B1.3(f) required a consecutive term of imprisonment, id. at \n83a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018).  The court added \nthat \u201c[c]oncurrent time\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot \npunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The \ncourt then imposed a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of im-\nprisonment to be served \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served \nin the two state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised release \nto follow the imprisonment.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a. \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration of pun-\nishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecifically omits\u201d that \nSection 3553(a)(2) factor from considerations.  Pet. App. 82a, \n86a.  The court acknowledged that objection.  Id. at 86a. \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals subsequently affirmed, noting that Leaks \nhad \u201cacknowledge[d] that his argument is foreclosed by United \nStates v. Lewis, [supra].\u201d  Pet. App. 74a-75a. \n3. \nFrom 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly known as \nTimothy Watters), transported cocaine and marijuana from Texas and \nMichigan to Ohio, where he distributed the drugs.  3:10-cr-4 \nPresentence Investigation Report \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (report for Timothy M. \nWatters dated Nov. 20, 2013).  After a federal grand jury indicted \nhim on federal drug charges, Jaimez pleaded guilty to conspiring \nto possess cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  3:10-\ncr-4 Judgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 3:10-cr-4 Indictment.  The \ndistrict court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by five years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Judg-\nment 2-3. \nAfter he started that term of supervised release, \u201cJaimez \nused drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully \ndisclose financial information to his probation officer.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 54a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s \nsupervised release and imposed a 14-month term of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by three years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Order \n(Sept. 5, 2019). \nAfter Jaimez started his second term of supervised release, \nhe returned to drug dealing.  Pet. App. 54a.  Police officers found \n\n13 \n \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at Jaimez\u2019s properties, \npolice found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press.\u201d  \nIbid.  Based on that conduct, Jaimez was convicted in Ohio state \ncourt of attempting to transport marijuana.  Ibid. \nIn 2022, the Probation Office reported to the district court \nthat Jaimez had committed multiple supervised-release violations, \nincluding drug trafficking, associating with a convicted felon, \nand possessing drug paraphernalia.  3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022).  The court held a revocation hearing.  3:10-\ncr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381 (Mar. 27, 2023) (transcript).  Jaimez admitted \ncommitting those three violations, and the court accordingly found \nthat Jaimez had violated the terms of his supervised release.  Pet. \nApp. 59a.  The court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release and im-\nposed a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by six years of supervised release.  Ibid.; see id. at \n54a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto protect \nthe public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of compliance of the terms \nand conditions,\u201d and to foster \u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic \ndeterrence.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \n\u201cnow twice\u201d shown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of \nsupervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of Jaimez \nand his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d con-\n\n14 \n \ntaining \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of marijuana illustrated that Jaimez \nwas \u201cpaying no attention\u201d to those conditions.  Id. at 62a-63a.  \nThe court stated that the revocation term would emphasize to Jaimez \nand \u201cthe public generally\u201d that such conditions are mandatory and \nthat violating them means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  Ibid.  The court added that \nthe term of imprisonment was \u201ca just and deserved sanction\u201d that \nwas \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to get [Jaimez\u2019s] \nattention\u201d and would hopefully \u201cenhance respect for the law\u201d by \nshowing that compliance with supervised-release conditions is \n\u201cyour only option.\u201d  Id. at 65a-66a.  Jaimez did not lodge any \nobjection to the factors that the court had considered.  Id. at \n67a-71a; see 3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381, at 57-60. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 53a-58a.  The court \nrejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly \nrelied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors by considering \u201cthe se-\nriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, \nand the provision of just punishment.\u201d  Id. at 55a.  The court \nbased its decision on its prior decisions in petitioner Esteras\u2019s \ncase and in Lewis.  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 16-20) that the district courts \nerred by considering factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- \u201cthe \nseriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law,\u201d \n\n15 \n \nand \u201cprovid[ing] just punishment for the offense\u201d -- when revoking \ntheir supervised release and ordering imprisonment.  Petitioners \nfurther contend (Pet. 12-16) that the decisions below implicate a \ndivision of authority warranting review.  Those contentions lack \nmerit.  Section 3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court consider certain \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a) before revoking supervised re-\nlease and ordering reimprisonment did not require that the district \ncourts wholly disregard those other factors irrespective of their \nrelevance to the factors that Section 3583(e) expressly cross-\nreferences.  Any modest disagreement among the courts of appeals \non the question presented has no practical effect and would not \nchange the result of petitioners\u2019 cases, in which the district \ncourts briefly referred to the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors while \nconsidering undisputedly permissible factors. \nThis Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases pre-\nsenting this question, including the earlier Sixth Circuit deci-\nsion relied upon by the courts below.  See Lewis v. United States, \n555 U.S. 813 (2008) (No. 07-1295); see also, e.g., Jones v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2692 (No. 18-7857); Clay v. United States, 574 \nU.S. 1080 (2015) (No. 14-6010); Overton v. United States, 565 U.S. \n1063 (2011) (No. 11-5408); Young v. United States, 565 U.S. 863 \n(2011) (No. 10-11026).  The same result is warranted here. \n1. \nSection 3583(e) provides in pertinent part that a dis-\ntrict court may revoke supervised release and reimprison a defen-\n\n16 \n \ndant \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  Although Section 3583(e) \ndoes not cross-reference 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- which describes \nthe need for a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for \nthe offense\u201d (ibid.) -- nothing in Section 3583(e) precludes con-\nsideration of those factors when the district court deems them \nrelevant. \na. \nThe \u201cenumeration in [Section] 3583(e) of specified sub-\nsections of [Section] 3553(a) that a court must consider in re-\nvoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into \naccount any other pertinent factor.\u201d  United States v. Young, 634 \nF.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 565 U.S. \n863 (2011).  Section 3583(e)\u2019s cross-reference to specific provi-\nsions of Section 3553(a) reflects a legislative judgment that the \nfactors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a \ncourt must consider.  But as the court of appeals recognized, the \nomission of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors from the list of man-\ndatory factors does not mean that any reference to the seriousness \nof the underlying offense, promoting respect for the law, or \nproviding just punishment is automatically erroneous.  See Pet. \nApp. 8a (emphasizing that Section 3583 \u201cnever says that the court \n\n17 \n \nmay consider \u2018only\u2019 [the listed] factors\u201d) (citation omitted); see \nalso, e.g., Young, 634 F.3d at 239. \nNothing in Section 3583(e) requires district courts to wholly \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, including the federal \ncrimes underlying the original imposition of the supervised re-\nlease that is being revoked, see Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 701 (2000), when determining an appropriate postrevoca-\ntion penalty.  As a practical matter, the factors listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) overlap substantially with the ones listed in the \nprovisions of Section 3553(a) that Section 3583(e) expressly \ncross-references.  The cross-referenced provisions require con-\nsideration of, among other factors, \u201cthe nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defend-\nant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \n\u201cpr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 14a-18a) is \nunreported. \nIn petitioner Leaks\u2019s case, the order of the court of appeals \n(Pet. App. 74a-75a) is not reported in the Federal Reporter but is \navailable at 2024 WL 2196795.  The order of the district court \n(Pet. App. 76a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nIn petitioner Jaimez\u2019s case, the opinion of the court of \nappeals (Pet. App. 53a-58a) is reported at 95 F.4th 1004.  The \norder of the district court (Pet. App. 59a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nIn Esteras\u2019s case, the amended judgment of the court of ap-\npeals was entered on December 20, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing \nwere denied on December 20, 2023 (Pet. App. 19a-29a) and March 7, \n2024 (Pet. App. 30a-34a).  In Leaks\u2019s and Jaimez\u2019s cases, the \njudgments of the court of appeals were entered, respectively, on \nMarch 6, 2024, and on March 12, 2024.  The petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was filed on May 15, 2024.  Cf. Sup. Ct. R. 12.4.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, each petitioner \nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be followed by a term \nof supervised release.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated \none or more terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and imposed a term of \nimprisonment.  Pet. App. 14a-18a, 59a, 76a.  In each case, the \ncourt of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 4a-13a, 53a-58a, 74a-75a. \n1. \na. \nIn 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Pet. App. 5a.  The \n\n3 \n \ndistrict court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of imprisonment, \nconsecutive to a 15-month prison term for violating his probation \nfor a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, to be followed by \nsix years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn January 2020, Esteras began serving his six-year term of \nsupervised release.  Pet. App. 5a.  In January 2023, the Probation \nOffice reported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing domestic vio-\nlence, aggravated menacing, and criminal damaging in violation of \nstate law, and (2) possessing a firearm.  Id. at 5a, 16a.  The \nreport stated that, on January 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the \nmother of his children in the head at her residence; stormed out \nto his vehicle; and, after the victim followed him and attempted \nto grab his car keys, pointed a handgun at her, threated to kill \nher, and fired three rounds from his handgun into her vehicle.  \nId. at 15a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, 4:14-cr-425 D. Ct. Doc. 439 \n(June 22, 2023) (transcript), the district court found that Esteras \nhad \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d in the manner that the victim \nhad described to the police, as memorialized in body-camera video \nevidence.  Id. at 80; see Pet. App. 16a-17a & n.1.  The court noted \nthat it \u201csuspect[ed]\u201d that Esteras\u2019s conduct satisfied \u201cthe ele-\nments\u201d of the state-law violations reported, but was not suffi-\nciently versed in the state-law provisions to be certain.  Pet. \n\n4 \n \nApp. 37a.  But the court explained that \u201cit really d[id]n\u2019t matter\u201d \nand determined that, whether or not Esteras had violated state \nlaw, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervision by possessing a \n[firearm].\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 17a. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3), a district court that determines \nthat a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release \n\u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7),\u201d revoke the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and \norder reimprisonment.  The provisions of Section 3553(a) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) cross-references set forth a number of factors to \nconsider in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the sentence \nimposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \u201cprotect the public,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); the need to \u201cprovide the defendant \nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or \nother correctional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); the sen-\ntencing range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(4); pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need to pro-\nvide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7).  Section 3583(e) \ndoes not expressly cross-reference Section 3553(a)(2)(A), which \n\n5 \n \naddresses \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed * * * to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to \nprovide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for Esteras\u2019s  \nsupervised-release violation, the district court recounted his \nprior federal offenses, noted that he was \u201cno stranger to federal \ncourt\u201d or to \u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to encourage \n[him] to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a-39a.  And after recounting the circumstances surrounding \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation and observing that it was \n\u201cnot really sure what it will require for [Esteras] to learn that \nenough is enough,\u201d the court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary upwards\u201d \nfrom the Guidelines recommendation because Esteras\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d \nand \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typical\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d \nand \u201cmust stop.\u201d  Id. at 39a-41a. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of \nfactors identified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), including the need to \npromote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of, \nand provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] the offense.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-\n48a.  The court noted in response stated that its revocation term \nwas based in part \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and to \u201cdeter[]\u201d \nEsteras, but that it also rested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the \n\n6 \n \nsafety of the community\u201d and its desire to distinguish Esteras \nfrom a \u201ctypical\u201d defendant.  Id. at 48a.  In a subsequent written \norder (id. at 14a-18a), the district court observed that it had \nconsidered the factors in Section 3553(a) and 3583(d), and stated \nthat its revocation determination was based, \u201camong other rea-\nsons,\u201d on the need \u201cto protect society and promote respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 17a-18a; see 18 U.S.C. 3553(d) (addressing imposition \nof conditions of supervised release). \nb. \nThe court of appeals initially affirmed the supervised-\nrelease-revocation judgment in an unpublished order.  Pet. App. \n1a-3a.  The court later amended and reissued the order as a pub-\nlished disposition.  Id. at 4a-13a. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s argument that the \ndistrict court had improperly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) fac-\ntors when imposing a term of imprisonment after revoking his su-\npervised release.  Pet. App. 6a-13a.  The court observed that, \nunder its previous decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008), the dis-\ntrict court permissibly considered Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s fac-\ntors.  Pet. App. 8a.  The court highlighted Lewis\u2019s observation \nthat, as a \u201ctextual\u201d matter, Section 3583(e) requires a district \ncourt to \u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d before making supervised-\nrelease decisions but that, unlike other sentencing provisions, \nSection 3583(e) \u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nthose factors.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court also high-\nlighted Lewis\u2019s concern that a \u201cproposed bright-line rule\u201d for-\nbidding consideration of Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas un-\nworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations men-\ntioned in [Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals also offered several examples illustrat-\ning that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is unworkable,\u201d \nPet. App. 9a.  See id. at 8a-10a.  First, the court observed that \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201c\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u201d factor -- \nwhich Esteras argued could not be considered -- \u201caligns with [Sec-\ntion] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u2018the nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u2019\u201d which Section 3583(e) expressly requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  Id. at 8a-9a.  Second, the court \nstated that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed \u2018to promote respect for \nthe law\u2019\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the rationale that revoking super-\nvised release will \u2018help\u2019 the defendant \u2018learn to obey the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 9a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors the other,\u201d \nnoting that the district court judge \u201cquite understandably could \nnot see how she could ignore respect for the law but consider a \ndefendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised release.\u201d  \nIbid.  Third, the court of appeals observed that Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\n\n8 \n \nleled considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the district \ncourt to consider.  Ibid.  More specifically, the court explained \nthat a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to Section 3553(a)(5)\u2019s re-\nquirement to consider various \u201c\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of \nthe Sentencing Commission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose \na revocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned by \nthe original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the conduct that \nviolated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals additionally stated that the view that \nSection 3583(e) lists the only permissible factors that may inform \na revocation term was \u201cunworkable in another way\u201d:  Section 3583(c) \nincludes the same set of factors that are listed in Section 3583(e) \nas considerations for a district court in initially imposing a \nterm of supervised release at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing.  \nPet. App. 6a, 9a; see id. at 8a (observing that \u201cEsteras claims \nthat [Section] 3583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations\u201d).  The court \nstated that \u201cCongress could not have expected courts\u201d at an initial \nsentencing \u201cto wipe their minds of\u201d more expansive sentencing \n\u201cconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, \nand nothing in the statute requires such compartmentalization.\u201d  \nId. at 9a-10a. \nFinally, the court of appeals observed that its \u201cunderstand-\ning of [Section] 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other \n\n9 \n \ncircuits and the outcomes of all of them.\u201d  Pet. App. 11a.  The \ncourt explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that courts may invoke \nfactors related to the three general considerations in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sen-\ntence,\u201d and that the circuits that have \u201cdescribed the [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still \nrecognize that they may play supporting roles in a district court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d such that \u201c[e]ven under these decisions,\u201d the district \ncourt here \u201cacted properly.\u201d  Id. at 11a-12a. \nc. \nOn the same day that the panel issued its amended order, \nthe court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Pet. App. 19a-29a.  \nJudge Moore dissented from the denial, on the view that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 21a-27a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehearing was warranted, but \ndid not state that the panel had erred.  Id. at 28a-29a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition for re-\nhearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  Pet. App. 30a-34a.  Judge \nMoore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated her belief that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 32a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudges Stranch and Bloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing \nwas warranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  Id. \nat 33a-34a. \n2. \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police of-\nficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun under his \n\n10 \n \nseat with three (15-, 20- and 30-round-capacity) magazines con-\ntaining 21 rounds of ammunition.  1:19-cr-283 D. Ct. Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 7-\n14 (Dec. 23, 2019) (Presentence Investigation Report).  Leaks \npleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  Pet. App. \n74a.  The district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of impris-\nonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks began serving his term of supervised \nrelease.  23-3547 Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including a state unlawful-firearm-\npossession offense and a state robbery offense to which Leaks had \npleaded guilty and had been sentenced, respectively, to three years \nand four to six years of imprisonment.  Pet. App. 74a, 80a-81a.  \nLeaks subsequently admitted to committing five supervised-release \nviolations: the two state-law crimes just noted, failing to report \nfor supervision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work towards a GED.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a.  The district \ncourt accordingly found that Leaks had violated the terms of his \nsupervised release.  Id. at 81a.  Leaks then acknowledged through \ncounsel that \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute to impose a \nterm of imprisonment\u201d given \u201cthe nature of [Leaks\u2019s] violation\u201d \nbut requested that the court run the term of imprisonment concur-\n\n11 \n \nrent with, not consecutive to, the state-court sentences for his \nstate-law violations.  Id. at 82a. \nBefore making its supervised-release revocation determina-\ntion, the district court noted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] \noffense\u201d for which supervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine \ngun\u201d and that Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The court also noted that Leaks had \ncommitted a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on supervised release.  \nIbid.  And the court agreed with \u201call of the statements made by \n[government counsel],\u201d ibid., who had noted that Sentencing Guide-\nline 7B1.3(f) required a consecutive term of imprisonment, id. at \n83a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018).  The court added \nthat \u201c[c]oncurrent time\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot \npunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The \ncourt then imposed a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of im-\nprisonment to be served \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served \nin the two state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised release \nto follow the imprisonment.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a. \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration of pun-\nishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecifically omits\u201d that \nSection 3553(a)(2) factor from considerations.  Pet. App. 82a, \n86a.  The court acknowledged that objection.  Id. at 86a. \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals subsequently affirmed, noting that Leaks \nhad \u201cacknowledge[d] that his argument is foreclosed by United \nStates v. Lewis, [supra].\u201d  Pet. App. 74a-75a. \n3. \nFrom 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly known as \nTimothy Watters), transported cocaine and marijuana from Texas and \nMichigan to Ohio, where he distributed the drugs.  3:10-cr-4 \nPresentence Investigation Report \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (report for Timothy M. \nWatters dated Nov. 20, 2013).  After a federal grand jury indicted \nhim on federal drug charges, Jaimez pleaded guilty to conspiring \nto possess cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  3:10-\ncr-4 Judgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 3:10-cr-4 Indictment.  The \ndistrict court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by five years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Judg-\nment 2-3. \nAfter he started that term of supervised release, \u201cJaimez \nused drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully \ndisclose financial information to his probation officer.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 54a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s \nsupervised release and imposed a 14-month term of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by three years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Order \n(Sept. 5, 2019). \nAfter Jaimez started his second term of supervised release, \nhe returned to drug dealing.  Pet. App. 54a.  Police officers found \n\n13 \n \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at Jaimez\u2019s properties, \npolice found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press.\u201d  \nIbid.  Based on that conduct, Jaimez was convicted in Ohio state \ncourt of attempting to transport marijuana.  Ibid. \nIn 2022, the Probation Office reported to the district court \nthat Jaimez had committed multiple supervised-release violations, \nincluding drug trafficking, associating with a convicted felon, \nand possessing drug paraphernalia.  3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022).  The court held a revocation hearing.  3:10-\ncr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381 (Mar. 27, 2023) (transcript).  Jaimez admitted \ncommitting those three violations, and the court accordingly found \nthat Jaimez had violated the terms of his supervised release.  Pet. \nApp. 59a.  The court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release and im-\nposed a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by six years of supervised release.  Ibid.; see id. at \n54a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto protect \nthe public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of compliance of the terms \nand conditions,\u201d and to foster \u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic \ndeterrence.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \n\u201cnow twice\u201d shown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of \nsupervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of Jaimez \nand his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d con-\n\n14 \n \ntaining \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of marijuana illustrated that Jaimez \nwas \u201cpaying no attention\u201d to those conditions.  Id. at 62a-63a.  \nThe court stated that the revocation term would emphasize to Jaimez \nand \u201cthe public generally\u201d that such conditions are mandatory and \nthat violating them means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  Ibid.  The court added that \nthe term of imprisonment was \u201ca just and deserved sanction\u201d that \nwas \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to get [Jaimez\u2019s] \nattention\u201d and would hopefully \u201cenhance respect for the law\u201d by \nshowing that compliance with supervised-release conditions is \n\u201cyour only option.\u201d  Id. at 65a-66a.  Jaimez did not lodge any \nobjection to the factors that the court had considered.  Id. at \n67a-71a; see 3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381, at 57-60. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 53a-58a.  The court \nrejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly \nrelied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors by considering \u201cthe se-\nriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, \nand the provision of just punishment.\u201d  Id. at 55a.  The court \nbased its decision on its prior decisions in petitioner Esteras\u2019s \ncase and in Lewis.  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 16-20) that the district courts \nerred by considering factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- \u201cthe \nseriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law,\u201d \n\n15 \n \nand \u201cprovid[ing] just punishment for the offense\u201d -- when revoking \ntheir supervised release and ordering imprisonment.  Petitioners \nfurther contend (Pet. 12-16) that the decisions below implicate a \ndivision of authority warranting review.  Those contentions lack \nmerit.  Section 3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court consider certain \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a) before revoking supervised re-\nlease and ordering reimprisonment did not require that the district \ncourts wholly disregard those other factors irrespective of their \nrelevance to the factors that Section 3583(e) expressly cross-\nreferences.  Any modest disagreement among the courts of appeals \non the question presented has no practical effect and would not \nchange the result of petitioners\u2019 cases, in which the district \ncourts briefly referred to the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors while \nconsidering undisputedly permissible factors. \nThis Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases pre-\nsenting this question, including the earlier Sixth Circuit deci-\nsion relied upon by the courts below.  See Lewis v. United States, \n555 U.S. 813 (2008) (No. 07-1295); see also, e.g., Jones v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2692 (No. 18-7857); Clay v. United States, 574 \nU.S. 1080 (2015) (No. 14-6010); Overton v. United States, 565 U.S. \n1063 (2011) (No. 11-5408); Young v. United States, 565 U.S. 863 \n(2011) (No. 10-11026).  The same result is warranted here. \n1. \nSection 3583(e) provides in pertinent part that a dis-\ntrict court may revoke supervised release and reimprison a defen-\n\n16 \n \ndant \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  Although Section 3583(e) \ndoes not cross-reference 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- which describes \nthe need for a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for \nthe offense\u201d (ibid.) -- nothing in Section 3583(e) precludes con-\nsideration of those factors when the district court deems them \nrelevant. \na. \nThe \u201cenumeration in [Section] 3583(e) of specified sub-\nsections of [Section] 3553(a) that a court must consider in re-\nvoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into \naccount any other pertinent factor.\u201d  United States v. Young, 634 \nF.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 565 U.S. \n863 (2011).  Section 3583(e)\u2019s cross-reference to specific provi-\nsions of Section 3553(a) reflects a legislative judgment that the \nfactors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a \ncourt must consider.  But as the court of appeals recognized, the \nomission of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors from the list of man-\ndatory factors does not mean that any reference to the seriousness \nof the underlying offense, promoting respect for the law, or \nproviding just punishment is automatically erroneous.  See Pet. \nApp. 8a (emphasizing that Section 3583 \u201cnever says that the court \n\n17 \n \nmay consider \u2018only\u2019 [the listed] factors\u201d) (citation omitted); see \nalso, e.g., Young, 634 F.3d at 239. \nNothing in Section 3583(e) requires district courts to wholly \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, including the federal \ncrimes underlying the original imposition of the supervised re-\nlease that is being revoked, see Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 701 (2000), when determining an appropriate postrevoca-\ntion penalty.  As a practical matter, the factors listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) overlap substantially with the ones listed in the \nprovisions of Section 3553(a) that Section 3583(e) expressly \ncross-references.  The cross-referenced provisions require con-\nsideration of, among other factors, \u201cthe nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defend-\nant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \n\u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), and (C).  Effective consideration of \nthose factors will often require some recognition of the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  It is hard to \u201csee how\u201d a district court \n\u201ccould possibly ignore\u201d the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors --  \nincluding \u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d -- while evaluating, \nfor example, the need for \u201c\u2018adequate deterrence,\u2019\u201d the objective \nof protecting \u201cthe public from \u2018further crimes of the defendant,\u2019\u201d \nand \u201c\u2018the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u2019\u201d  United States \nv. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\n18 \n \n3553(a)(1), (2)(B) and (C)); see United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393, 400 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[T]he three considerations in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) * * * are essentially redundant with matters \ncourts are already permitted to take into consideration when im-\nposing sentences for violation of supervised release.\u201d), cert. \ndenied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008). \nThe district courts\u2019 approaches here did not violate Section \n3583(e).  In Esteras\u2019s case, the district court referred to the \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, Pet. App. 48a, but it considered \nother indisputably permissible factors, emphasizing in particular \nthe need to deter Esteras from future misconduct and to protect \nthe public.  See p. 5, supra; see also Pet. App. 12a-13a.  In \nLeaks\u2019s case, the district court briefly referred to Leaks\u2019s un-\nderlying firearms offense, but it did so in the context of con-\nsidering his supervised-release violations -- which likewise in-\nvolved firearms -- and the court ultimately determined that the \nSentencing Guidelines themselves called for consecutive terms of \nimprisonment.  See p. 11, supra.  And in Jaimez\u2019s case, the dis-\ntrict court emphasized that the \u201creasons\u201d for its revocation order \nwere factors that Section 3583(e) required the court to consider: \nthe need to adequately \u201cdeter[]\u201d criminal misconduct and \u201cprotect \nthe public.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a-65a; see pp. 13-14, supra; see also 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C).  While the court referred briefly to \nJaimez\u2019s \u201cprior criminal record,\u201d and the need to enhance \u201crespect \n\n19 \n \nfor the law,\u201d Pet. App. 65a, it was required to consider Jaimez\u2019s \nbackground and history, see 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1), and \u201crespect for \nthe law\u201d goes hand-in-hand with deterrence. \nb. \nPetitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 16-17) on this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 (2011), is mis-\nplaced.  The question in Tapia was whether a district court could \nproperly consider the need for rehabilitation when imposing a term \nof imprisonment in an initial sentencing despite the statement in \n18 U.S.C. 3582(a) that \u201cimprisonment is not an appropriate means \nof promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d  The Court relied on \nthe plain meaning of that statutory language to conclude that the \nsentencing court could not consider rehabilitation.  564 U.S. at \n326-327.  No similar statutory language prohibits consideration of \nthe factors specified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) at a supervised-\nrelease revocation proceeding.  Indeed, as Tapia and Section \n3582(a) illustrate, Congress knows how to clearly prohibit consi-\nderation of a sentencing factor, see ibid., but Congress did not \ndo so in Section 3583(e). \nIn describing the statutory background, Tapia stated that \u201ca \ncourt may not take account of retribution (the first purpose listed \nin \u00a7 3553(a)(2) when imposing a term of supervised release.\u201d  564 \nU.S. at 326.  Petitioners do not suggest that that the Court\u2019s \nstatement on that point constitutes a holding, see Pet. 16-17, and \nthe Court in any event referred only to the \u201cimposi[tion]\u201d of \n\n20 \n \nsupervised release, Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326, not to revocation of \nsupervised release or an order of reimprisonment -- the proceedings \nat issue here. \n2. \nPetitioners assert (Pet. 12-15) that the court of ap-\npeals are divided about whether a district court may consider the \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in revoking supervised \nrelease and ordering reimprisonment under Section 3583(e).  Like \nother petitioners who have unsuccessfully raised this question, \ne.g., Jones, supra; Clay, supra, petitioners substantially over-\nstate the extent of any disagreement in the circuits.  And, as in \nthose previous cases, any modest disagreement has little practical \neffect and does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.  See p. 15, supra. \na. \nThe majority of circuits that have addressed the issue, \nincluding the court below, have correctly determined that Section \n3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court revoking supervised release and \nordering reimprisonment must consider factors enumerated in par-\nticular provisions of Section 3553(a) does not mean that a court \nmay not consider other pertinent factors.  See, e.g., United States \nv. Vargas-D\u00e1vila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (observing \nthat Section 3583(e) \u201cdoes not forbid consideration of other per-\ntinent section 3553(a) factors\u201d); Young, 634 F.3d at 239; Williams, \n443 F.3d at 47 (observing that Section 3583 does not \u201cforbid[] \nconsideration of other pertinent factors\u201d); see also United States \nv. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (observing that a \n\n21 \n \ndistrict court may consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A) so long as it \n\u201crelies primarily on the factors\u201d in Section 3583(e)), cert. de-\nnied, 574 U.S. 1080 (2015); United States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, \n641 (4th Cir. 2013) (joining \u201cmany of our sister circuits\u201d on this \nissue). \nb. \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 12-13) that the Fourth, Fifth, \nNinth, and Tenth Circuits support their position. \nAs to the Fourth Circuit, petitioners cite (Pet. 12) only \nUnited States v. Crudup, 461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir. 2006), cert. \ndenied, 549 U.S. 1283 (2007), which ultimately affirmed a revoca-\ntion term.  And the nondispositive discussion of the issue in \nCrudup has since been superseded by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s direct \nconsideration of the issue in United States v. Webb, as cited \nabove. \nThe Fifth Circuit has stated \u201cthat it is improper for a dis-\ntrict court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or \nrevocation of a supervised release term.\u201d  United States v. Miller, \n634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 976 (2011).  \nBut the Fifth Circuit did not grant relief to the defendant in \nMiller, ibid., and subsequent decisions of that court (albeit in \nunpublished orders) illustrate that any marginal difference be-\ntween its standard and that of other courts of appeals makes little \npractical difference. \n\n22 \n \nFor example, in United States v. Zamarripa, 517 Fed. Appx. \n264 (2013) (per curiam), the Fifth Circuit rejected a claim that \na district court had violated Miller, distinguishing \u201cproperly \n[considering] the nature and circumstances of the original of-\nfense\u201d from \u201cintend[ing] improperly that the sentence reflect the \nseriousness of or impose just punishment for the original offense.\u201d  \nId. at 265; see United States v. Jones, 538 Fed. Appx. 505, 508 \n(5th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (rejecting Miller claim).  Petitioners \nthus fail to show that the Fifth Circuit would have resolved their \ncases differently.  And as noted above, this Court denied review \nin Miller and has denied review in subsequent cases presenting the \nsame question. \nThe Ninth Circuit has taken a slightly different approach.  \nIn United States v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173 (2006), that court con-\ncluded that a district court revoking supervised release erred by \nfailing to set forth sufficient reasons for ordering a term of \nreimprisonment outside the recommended guidelines range.  Id. at \n1177-1179.  In providing guidance for the district court on remand, \nthe Ninth Circuit stated that because \u201c[Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) is \na factor that Congress deliberately omitted from the list appli-\ncable to revocation sentencing, relying on that factor when im-\nposing a revocation sentence would be improper.\u201d  Id. at 1182.  \nThe Ninth Circuit then explained, however, that consideration of \nthe factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) would contravene Section \n\n23 \n \n3583(e) only if reliance on those facts was \u201ca primary basis for \na revocation sentence.\u201d  Ibid.  (emphasis added). \nFor example, the Ninth Circuit explained, a \u201cmere reference \nto promoting respect for the law\u201d would not itself \u201crender a sen-\ntence unreasonable.\u201d  Miqbel, 444 F.3d at 1182.  In keeping with \nthat understanding, the Ninth Circuit has clarified that Miqbel \n\u201cdid not set forth a blanket proposition that a court in no cir-\ncumstances may consider the seriousness of the criminal offense \nunderlying the revocation,\u201d but merely explained that this con-\nsideration should not be the primary \u201cfoc[us]\u201d of an order of \nreimprisonment following revocation.  United States v. Simtob, 485 \nF.3d 1058, 1062 (2007).  Petitioners have thus failed to show that \ntheir cases would have been resolved differently under Miqbel. \nFinally, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Booker, 63 \nF.4th 1254 (10th Cir. 2023), concluded that a district court may \nnot \u201crevoke a term of supervised release based on the need for \nretribution,\u201d on the theory that Section 3583(e) \u201c\u2018implicitly for-\nbids\u2019\u201d consideration of \u201cthe retribution factor found in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d  Id. at 1256, 1259-1260; see id. at 1258-1262.  \nBut the Booker panel ultimately affirmed the district court on the \nground that any erroneous invocation of a Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactor in the case could not satisfy the plain-error standard of \nreview.  Id. at 1262-1264.  The panel observed that the revocation \ncourt made only a \u201csingle impermissible reference\u201d to Section \n\n24 \n \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and that such a reference was insufficient \nto demonstrate that it made any difference to the resulting term \nof imprisonment.  Id. at 1263. \nAs such, the ultimate result in Booker -- affirmance -- does \nnot conflict with the results reached here.  And after Booker, the \nTenth Circuit has declined to infer that a revocation term of \nimprisonment was impermissibly grounded in retribution where the \ndistrict court did not clearly indicate as much.  See United States \nv. Kearse, No. 23-1071, 2024 WL 488391, at *3-*6 (10th Cir. Feb. \n8, 2024) (unpublished).  The court has also repeatedly affirmed \nrevocation terms of imprisonment based on a Booker error on plain-\nerror review.  See United States v. Kratz, No. 22-5089, 2023 WL \n3035195, at *7-*9 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 2023) (unpublished); United \nStates v. Waffle, No. 22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480, at *2-*4 (10th \nCir. Apr. 17, 2023) (unpublished). \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \nELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR \n  Solicitor General \n \nNICOLE M.

The observation is an internal thought process, not new external evidence. It confirms my current understanding of the petitioner's arguments but does not introduce new facts, precedents, or counter-arguments related to the case's merits.\n\nThis observation serves to solidify my current belief state and define the next critical step in my analysis. It confirms that my understanding is now comprehensive with respect to the petitioner's position, which is built on:\n\n1.  **A Core Textual Argument:** The petitioner argues that Congress's omission of the retributive factors from \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in the supervised release revocation statute (\u00a7 3583(e)) was a deliberate preclusion, a point strengthened by the contrasting inclusion of these factors in the probation revocation statute (\u00a7 3565(a)). This relies on the *expressio unius* canon, supported by *Russello v. United States*.\n\n2.  **A Strong Precedential Analogy:** The case of *Tapia v. United States* is the central pillar, where the Court similarly found that a statutory omission precluded using imprisonment for rehabilitative purposes. The petitioner's argument is framed as a direct parallel to *Tapia*.\n\n3.  **A Constitutional Avoidance Doctrine:** A secondary argument posits that allowing punishment for conduct not proven beyond a reasonable doubt raises serious Sixth Amendment and Double Jeopardy concerns, citing *United States v. Haymond*.\n\n4.  **A Legislative Purpose Rationale:** The petitioner contends that the Sentencing Reform Act intended supervised release to be forward-looking and rehabilitative, not backward-looking and punitive.\n\nCrucially, this observation highlights the current one-sided nature of my knowledge. My belief state is now characterized by a detailed map of the petitioner's case and a clearly defined area of uncertainty: the United States' response. My predictive model now requires input on how the government will attempt to rebut these points. My focus is now squarely on discovering the government's counter-arguments, which I anticipate must address how to distinguish *Tapia*, explain the textual differences between the probation and supervised release statutes, and counter the constitutional avoidance argument. My confidence in any final prediction remains contingent on acquiring and analyzing this opposing viewpoint.",

          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has been significantly updated by the receipt of the United States' Brief in Opposition. My previous, detailed understanding of the petitioner's case is now balanced by a clear view of the government's counter-arguments, filling the critical gap I had identified. My knowledge of the legal landscape of this case is now two-sided, allowing for a more nuanced prediction.\n\nMy prior beliefs regarding the petitioner's four-pronged strategy remain stable and serve as the foundation against which I evaluate the government's response. To reiterate, the petitioner's case rests on:\n1.  A textual argument based on the *expressio unius* canon.\n2.  A precedential analogy to *Tapia v. United States*.\n3.  A constitutional avoidance argument citing *United States v. Haymond*.\n4.  A legislative purpose argument about the forward-looking nature of supervised release.\n\nThe new observation\u2014the government's brief\u2014introduces the following counter-arguments, which directly rebut the petitioner's claims and the premise that this case warrants Supreme Court review:\n\n1.  **The Statutory List is Not Exclusive:** The government's primary textual argument is that \u00a7 3583(e) mandates that courts *must* consider the listed factors, but it does not state that they may *only* consider those factors. The absence of a word like \"only\" is presented as dispositive, directly countering the petitioner's reliance on the *expressio unius* canon. This suggests the omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) was not a prohibition.\n\n2.  **The Factors are Intertwined and Overlapping:** The government argues that the petitioner's proposed bright-line rule is \"unworkable\" because the supposedly \"forbidden\" retributive factors are \"essentially redundant\" with the permitted ones. This is a crucial practical argument that undermines the petitioner's entire framework. The government provides specific examples:\n    *   The forbidden \"seriousness of the offense\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)) aligns with the permitted \"nature and circumstances of the offense\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)).\n    *   The forbidden need to \"promote respect for the law\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)) meshes with the permitted goals of affording \"adequate deterrence\" and \"protect[ing] the public\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C)).\n    *   The forbidden \"just punishment\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)) parallels the permitted consideration of Sentencing Commission policy statements (\u00a7 3553(a)(5)), which explicitly mention that a revocation sentence should reflect the \"breach of trust\" represented by the violation.\n\n3.  **The Circuit Split is Illusory:** The government contends that while circuits may use different language, there is no meaningful, outcome-determinative split. They argue that even circuits describing the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as \"impermissible\" still allow them to play \"supporting roles,\" meaning the outcome in Esteras's case would be the same regardless of the circuit. This is a direct attack on the primary justification for granting certiorari.\n\n4.  **A History of Certiorari Denials:** The government explicitly notes that the Supreme Court has repeatedly denied review on this exact question, citing *Lewis v. United States* (2008) and several more recent cases. This is a strong signal that the Court may not view this issue as pressing or cert-worthy.\n\n5.  **Structural Inconsistency with \u00a7 3583(c):** The brief points out that \u00a7 3583(c), which governs the *initial* imposition of supervised release, uses the same list of factors. The government argues it would be illogical for Congress to expect a judge, during a single sentencing hearing, to consider punitive factors for the prison term but then \"wipe their minds\" of them when imposing the subsequent term of supervised release.\n\nMy predictive model is now substantially more complete. The central conflict is a classic interpretive battle: the petitioner's clean textualism (*expressio unius*) versus the government's pragmatic argument that the statutory scheme is not so neatly compartmentalized. The government's \"unworkability\" and \"overlap\" arguments are powerful, as they suggest that even if the petitioner's reading is technically correct, it has little practical effect, a point that may resonate with the Court. My confidence in a ruling for the petitioner has decreased, as the government has presented a robust, multi-faceted defense of the status quo that aligns with the Sixth Circuit's reasoning and highlights the Court's own history of denying review on this question.",

This action directly seeks the petitioner's response to those arguments. The outcome of this search will cause a very large update to my task beliefs (\u03b8). A strong reply could significantly increase the perceived likelihood of a grant, while a weak or non-existent reply would cement my belief that certiorari will be denied. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high. The Design EIG is moderate. This action reinforces a fundamental, but already understood, strategic principle: the petition-opposition-reply sequence is the core informational unit at the certiorari stage. Successfully using the reply brief to resolve uncertainty created by the opposition brief is a key pattern, and this action provides a perfect test case for that pattern's effectiveness, thus refining my general model (D).",

L. REV. 1381 (2024) ........... 6 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe parties agree that the courts of appeals are split regarding whether a court \nrevoking supervising release may consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A): the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for \nthe law, and provide just punishment for the offense. \nThe Government claims that the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest disagree-\nment\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of petitioners\u2019 \ncases.\u201d Not so. Take Petitioner Leaks. Imposing a 12-month prison term consecutive \nto state sentences previously imposed for convictions based on the same conduct, the \ndistrict court cited a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014the need for just punishment\u2014and \nonly that factor. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while other circuits have vacated district-\ncourt judgments when faced with similar facts.  \nAnd the practical effect is not just on appeal. District courts in four circuits \noperate under instructions not to consider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when re-\nvoking supervised release. District courts elsewhere do not. As one district judge in \nthe Sixth Circuit put it, \u201cI absolutely can punish him. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d \nMoreover, if the Government were correct, the statute would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the Government\u2019s approach, section 3583(e) would allow district courts \nto impose new criminal punishments without providing defendants their required \ntrial and due-process rights. The opposition brief does not even mention this concern. \nBut Congress did not enact an unconstitutional statute. The text, statutory \ncontext, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedents establish that section 3583(e) \n\n2 \n \nbars district courts from considering punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when revoking supervised release. The Court should grant certiorari, resolve \nthe circuit split, and reverse the judgments below. \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. \nThe split among the lower courts is deep, pervasive, and of real practical effect. \nCourts and commentators alike have noted the established split among the \ncourts of appeals regarding whether district courts may consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 13-14.  \nAccording to the Government, though, the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest \ndisagreement\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of peti-\ntioners\u2019 cases.\u201d Br. in Opp\u2019n at 15. That is not accurate. Petitioner Leaks\u2019 case pro-\nvides the clearest example. When the district court revoked his supervised release \nand imposed a 12-month sentence, to be served consecutive to his state sentences, the \ncourt pointed to a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor, and only that factor: the need for just \npunishment. See App. at 85a ( \u201cConcurrent time does not punish Mr. Leaks for vio-\nlating supervision and -- and. . . that is not justice.\u201d (ellipses in transcript)). The Sixth \nCircuit affirmed, relying on its published precedent holding that district courts may \nconsider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors without restriction. See App. at 75a. \nFaced with similar scenarios where district courts relied primarily on section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have reached the opposite result. \nFor example, in United States v. Pennington, No. 21-4664, 2022 WL 2702577 (4th \nCir. Jul. 12, 2022), the district court \u201cparticularly\u201d relied on \u201cthe seriousness of the \n\n3 \n \nviolation conduct\u201d\u2014a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014while \u201cbriefly mention[ing]\u201d four \nother factors, including the remaining two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. at *2. Re-\nlying on its published precedent, the Fourth Circuit vacated the resulting sentence \nbecause the court \u201crelied predominantly on impermissible factors.\u201d Id. Likewise, in \nUnited States v. Barnes, 258 F. App\u2019x 95 (9th Cir. 2007), the court of appeals deter-\nmined from the district court\u2019s comments that punishment was \u201ca primary basis\u201d for \nits sentence. Id. at 96. Relying on published Ninth Circuit precedent, the court there-\nfore vacated the sentence. Id. \nThe Fifth and Tenth Circuits have indicated that they also will vacate sen-\ntences on the same grounds when defendants properly preserve their issues for ap-\npeal, as petitioners did here. In United States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012 (5th Cir. 2015), \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded that the district court committed plain error by using two \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014the seriousness of the violation conduct and the need \nto provide just punishment\u2014as dominant factors in its sentence. Id. at 1017. The \nappellate court further found that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial \nrights, but under the fourth prong on plain-error review, declined to exercise its dis-\ncretion to remedy the error. Id. at 1018-19. Similarly, in United States v. Waffle, No. \n22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480 (10th Cir. Apr. 17, 2023), the Government conceded that, \nunder published Tenth Circuit precedent, the district court committed plain error by \nconsidering two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking the defendant\u2019s super-\nvised release\u2014the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. \n\n4 \n \nId. at *2. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence, but only because the defendant \ndid not prevail on the third and fourth prongs of plain-error review. Id. at *4.  \n \nIn each of the three petitioners\u2019 cases, the district court expressly relied on \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and the issues are properly preserved for appeal. In Pe-\ntitioner Leaks\u2019 case, a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor was the only factor that the district \ncourt pointed to. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits would have vacated and remanded in these circumstances. The split \namong the lower courts has a real, practical effect. \n \nJust as importantly, the effect is not limited to petitioners. On appeal, the \nSixth Circuit has unfailingly affirmed revocation sentences where district courts re-\nlied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, see United States v. Jones, 81 F. 4th 591, \n601-02 (6th Cir. 2023), even when the court relied on only those factors, see United \nStates v. Durrell, No. 23-3841, 2024 WL 2830632 (6th Cir. Jun. 4, 2024), pet. for cert. \npending, No. 24-5456 (filed Aug. 27, 2024). And in the many cases that do not result \nin appeals, the split among the lower courts also has real, practical effect. The Fourth, \nFifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, district courts revoking supervised release are op-\nerating under their appellate court\u2019s instructions not to consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors. In the Sixth Circuit and elsewhere, though, the district courts \nhave free reign to rely on them, including by expressly imposing new criminal pun-\nishments. As one district judge in the Sixth Circuit put it,  \u201cI absolutely can punish \nhim. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d App. at 97a. \n \n\n5 \n \nII. \nThis Court\u2019s intervention is necessary to ensure that the lower courts apply 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) as Congress intended, without circumventing the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s criminal due-process and trial guarantees.  \nIf 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) were as the Government says, it would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the interpretation urged by the Government and adopted by the Sixth \nCircuit and others, a district court could impose a multi-year prison term primarily \nor exclusively based on the need to punish (one of the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors). \nBut the Constitution guarantees defendants a trial if facing a prison term of more \nthan six months as a new criminal punishment. See Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. \n66, 69 (1970) (plurality op.); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968). Under \nthe Government\u2019s approach, a district court could impose a prison term as a criminal \npunishment even if a defendant had already been sentenced by a federal court in a \nnew criminal case for the same offense. But the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the \nsame sovereign from imposing multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. \nSee Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 683-84 (2019). The Government\u2019s opposi-\ntion brief ignores these problems. See Pet. at 18-19. \nPer Justice Breyer\u2019s controlling concurrence in United States v. Haymond, 588 \nU.S. 634 (2019), this Court has already indicated that a district court may not impose \na new criminal punishment for a supervised release violation without providing the \nrequired due-process and trial rights. Justice Breyer concluded that 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(k) was unconstitutional because that particular revocation provision \u201cmore \nclosely resemble[d] the punishment of new criminal offenses, but without granting a \ndefendant the rights, including the jury right, that attend a new criminal prosecu-\ntion.\u201d Id. at 659 (Breyer, J., concurring). The same constitutional problem exists when \n\n6 \n \ndistrict courts expressly impose punishment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 700 (2000); App. at 37a; App at 85a; App. at 97a-98a. That is consistent with the \noriginal understanding of the jury-trial right. See Jacob Schuman, Revocation at the \nFounding, 122 MICH. L. REV. 1381 (2024). \nAs written, though, section 3583(e) does not violate the Constitution. The text, \nstatutory context, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedent all indicate that dis-\ntrict courts may not rely on punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 16-17. Other circuits have found little \ndifficulty addressing the \u201cunworkability\u201d concerns suggested by the Esteras panel \nand echoed by the Government (Br. in Opp\u2019n at 8). See United States v. Wilcher, 91 \nF.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. 2024); United States v. Burden, 860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017); \nApp. at 25a-26a (Moore, J., dissenting from order denying rehearing en banc). \nCongress did not attempt to create a new, broad exception to criminal defend-\nants\u2019 constitutionally guaranteed trial and due-process rights when it enacted 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). This Court should grant certiorari, resolve the circuit split, and in-\nstruct the lower courts to apply the statute as written.   \n \nCONCLUSION  \n \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJOSEPH MEDICI   \n \n \nSTEPHEN C.

L. REV. 1381 (2024) ........... 6 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe parties agree that the courts of appeals are split regarding whether a court \nrevoking supervising release may consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A): the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for \nthe law, and provide just punishment for the offense. \nThe Government claims that the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest disagree-\nment\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of petitioners\u2019 \ncases.\u201d Not so. Take Petitioner Leaks. Imposing a 12-month prison term consecutive \nto state sentences previously imposed for convictions based on the same conduct, the \ndistrict court cited a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014the need for just punishment\u2014and \nonly that factor. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while other circuits have vacated district-\ncourt judgments when faced with similar facts.  \nAnd the practical effect is not just on appeal. District courts in four circuits \noperate under instructions not to consider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when re-\nvoking supervised release. District courts elsewhere do not. As one district judge in \nthe Sixth Circuit put it, \u201cI absolutely can punish him. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d \nMoreover, if the Government were correct, the statute would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the Government\u2019s approach, section 3583(e) would allow district courts \nto impose new criminal punishments without providing defendants their required \ntrial and due-process rights. The opposition brief does not even mention this concern. \nBut Congress did not enact an unconstitutional statute. The text, statutory \ncontext, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedents establish that section 3583(e) \n\n2 \n \nbars district courts from considering punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when revoking supervised release. The Court should grant certiorari, resolve \nthe circuit split, and reverse the judgments below. \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. \nThe split among the lower courts is deep, pervasive, and of real practical effect. \nCourts and commentators alike have noted the established split among the \ncourts of appeals regarding whether district courts may consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 13-14.  \nAccording to the Government, though, the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest \ndisagreement\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of peti-\ntioners\u2019 cases.\u201d Br. in Opp\u2019n at 15. That is not accurate. Petitioner Leaks\u2019 case pro-\nvides the clearest example. When the district court revoked his supervised release \nand imposed a 12-month sentence, to be served consecutive to his state sentences, the \ncourt pointed to a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor, and only that factor: the need for just \npunishment. See App. at 85a ( \u201cConcurrent time does not punish Mr. Leaks for vio-\nlating supervision and -- and. . . that is not justice.\u201d (ellipses in transcript)). The Sixth \nCircuit affirmed, relying on its published precedent holding that district courts may \nconsider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors without restriction. See App. at 75a. \nFaced with similar scenarios where district courts relied primarily on section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have reached the opposite result. \nFor example, in United States v. Pennington, No. 21-4664, 2022 WL 2702577 (4th \nCir. Jul. 12, 2022), the district court \u201cparticularly\u201d relied on \u201cthe seriousness of the \n\n3 \n \nviolation conduct\u201d\u2014a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014while \u201cbriefly mention[ing]\u201d four \nother factors, including the remaining two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. at *2. Re-\nlying on its published precedent, the Fourth Circuit vacated the resulting sentence \nbecause the court \u201crelied predominantly on impermissible factors.\u201d Id. Likewise, in \nUnited States v. Barnes, 258 F. App\u2019x 95 (9th Cir. 2007), the court of appeals deter-\nmined from the district court\u2019s comments that punishment was \u201ca primary basis\u201d for \nits sentence. Id. at 96. Relying on published Ninth Circuit precedent, the court there-\nfore vacated the sentence. Id. \nThe Fifth and Tenth Circuits have indicated that they also will vacate sen-\ntences on the same grounds when defendants properly preserve their issues for ap-\npeal, as petitioners did here. In United States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012 (5th Cir. 2015), \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded that the district court committed plain error by using two \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014the seriousness of the violation conduct and the need \nto provide just punishment\u2014as dominant factors in its sentence. Id. at 1017. The \nappellate court further found that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial \nrights, but under the fourth prong on plain-error review, declined to exercise its dis-\ncretion to remedy the error. Id. at 1018-19. Similarly, in United States v. Waffle, No. \n22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480 (10th Cir. Apr. 17, 2023), the Government conceded that, \nunder published Tenth Circuit precedent, the district court committed plain error by \nconsidering two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking the defendant\u2019s super-\nvised release\u2014the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. \n\n4 \n \nId. at *2. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence, but only because the defendant \ndid not prevail on the third and fourth prongs of plain-error review. Id. at *4.  \n \nIn each of the three petitioners\u2019 cases, the district court expressly relied on \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and the issues are properly preserved for appeal. In Pe-\ntitioner Leaks\u2019 case, a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor was the only factor that the district \ncourt pointed to. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits would have vacated and remanded in these circumstances. The split \namong the lower courts has a real, practical effect. \n \nJust as importantly, the effect is not limited to petitioners. On appeal, the \nSixth Circuit has unfailingly affirmed revocation sentences where district courts re-\nlied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, see United States v. Jones, 81 F. 4th 591, \n601-02 (6th Cir. 2023), even when the court relied on only those factors, see United \nStates v. Durrell, No. 23-3841, 2024 WL 2830632 (6th Cir. Jun. 4, 2024), pet. for cert. \npending, No. 24-5456 (filed Aug. 27, 2024). And in the many cases that do not result \nin appeals, the split among the lower courts also has real, practical effect. The Fourth, \nFifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, district courts revoking supervised release are op-\nerating under their appellate court\u2019s instructions not to consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors. In the Sixth Circuit and elsewhere, though, the district courts \nhave free reign to rely on them, including by expressly imposing new criminal pun-\nishments. As one district judge in the Sixth Circuit put it,  \u201cI absolutely can punish \nhim. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d App. at 97a. \n \n\n5 \n \nII. \nThis Court\u2019s intervention is necessary to ensure that the lower courts apply 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) as Congress intended, without circumventing the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s criminal due-process and trial guarantees.  \nIf 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) were as the Government says, it would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the interpretation urged by the Government and adopted by the Sixth \nCircuit and others, a district court could impose a multi-year prison term primarily \nor exclusively based on the need to punish (one of the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors). \nBut the Constitution guarantees defendants a trial if facing a prison term of more \nthan six months as a new criminal punishment. See Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. \n66, 69 (1970) (plurality op.); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968). Under \nthe Government\u2019s approach, a district court could impose a prison term as a criminal \npunishment even if a defendant had already been sentenced by a federal court in a \nnew criminal case for the same offense. But the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the \nsame sovereign from imposing multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. \nSee Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 683-84 (2019). The Government\u2019s opposi-\ntion brief ignores these problems. See Pet. at 18-19. \nPer Justice Breyer\u2019s controlling concurrence in United States v. Haymond, 588 \nU.S. 634 (2019), this Court has already indicated that a district court may not impose \na new criminal punishment for a supervised release violation without providing the \nrequired due-process and trial rights. Justice Breyer concluded that 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(k) was unconstitutional because that particular revocation provision \u201cmore \nclosely resemble[d] the punishment of new criminal offenses, but without granting a \ndefendant the rights, including the jury right, that attend a new criminal prosecu-\ntion.\u201d Id. at 659 (Breyer, J., concurring). The same constitutional problem exists when \n\n6 \n \ndistrict courts expressly impose punishment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 700 (2000); App. at 37a; App at 85a; App. at 97a-98a. That is consistent with the \noriginal understanding of the jury-trial right. See Jacob Schuman, Revocation at the \nFounding, 122 MICH. L. REV. 1381 (2024). \nAs written, though, section 3583(e) does not violate the Constitution. The text, \nstatutory context, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedent all indicate that dis-\ntrict courts may not rely on punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 16-17. Other circuits have found little \ndifficulty addressing the \u201cunworkability\u201d concerns suggested by the Esteras panel \nand echoed by the Government (Br. in Opp\u2019n at 8). See United States v. Wilcher, 91 \nF.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. 2024); United States v. Burden, 860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017); \nApp. at 25a-26a (Moore, J., dissenting from order denying rehearing en banc). \nCongress did not attempt to create a new, broad exception to criminal defend-\nants\u2019 constitutionally guaranteed trial and due-process rights when it enacted 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).

Consequently, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are not updated by this observation. My understanding of the case is still defined by the direct confrontation between the petitioner's arguments and the government's robust counter-arguments from its Brief in Opposition.\n\nMy belief state remains as follows:\n\n*   **Core Conflict:** The case hinges on a classic interpretive dispute. On one side is the petitioner's textualist argument based on the *expressio unius* canon, suggesting the omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors from the supervised release statute \u00a7 3583(e) was a deliberate prohibition. On the other side is the government's pragmatic and structural argument that the statute does not contain explicit exclusionary language (like \"only\") and that the \"forbidden\" retributive factors are practically and conceptually intertwined with the permitted ones (e.g., \"seriousness of the offense\" overlaps with \"nature and circumstances of the offense\").\n\n*   **Stable Arguments:** My knowledge of the key arguments from both sides is unchanged:\n    *   **Petitioner's Case:** Relies on (1) textualism via *expressio unius*, (2) analogy to *Tapia v. United States*, (3) constitutional avoidance post-*United States v. Haymond*, and (4) the forward-looking purpose of supervised release.\n    *   **Government's Rebuttal:** Argues (1) the statutory list in \u00a7 3583(e) is not exclusive, (2) the factors are too intertwined to separate, making the petitioner's rule unworkable, (3) the circuit split is superficial and not outcome-determinative, and (4) the Court's history of denying certiorari on this exact question (e.g., *Lewis v. United States*) signals a lack of urgency or merit.\n\n*   **Identified Information Gap:** The observation correctly articulates the current limitation of my predictive model. I have analyzed the opening argument (petition) and the primary defense (opposition brief). The critical missing piece of evidence is the petitioner's reply brief. This document is essential as it will show whether the petitioner has a compelling rebuttal to the government's powerful arguments, particularly the claims that the circuit split is illusory and that the proposed rule is unworkable in practice. My confidence in any prediction is currently tempered by the absence of this final piece of the pre-certiorari puzzle. My belief state is one of informed suspense, awaiting the petitioner's final word.",

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the petitioner's \"Reply Supporting Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" fills the critical information gap I previously identified. This new evidence directly and forcefully rebuts the government's primary arguments against granting certiorari, significantly strengthening the petitioner's case and altering my assessment of the legal landscape. My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n*   **Core Conflict:** The central dispute remains a clash between the petitioner's textualist/structural interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) and the government's pragmatic view. However, the petitioner's reply brief has successfully elevated the stakes by framing the government's position as not just pragmatically convenient but constitutionally perilous. The conflict is now more sharply defined as Textualism & Constitutional Avoidance vs. Pragmatism & Statutory Interconnectedness.\n\n*   **Strengthened Petitioner Arguments (New Evidence):** The reply brief provides specific, compelling evidence that directly counters the government's opposition brief:\n    *   **The Circuit Split is Deep and Outcome-Determinative:** The petitioner demolishes the government's claim that the split is a \"modest disagreement\" with \"no practical effect.\"\n        *   **New Fact:** The case of Petitioner Leaks is presented as a prime example. His district court imposed a sentence citing *only* \"just punishment\"\u2014a forbidden factor in other circuits. This provides a concrete, outcome-determinative example from within the case itself.\n        *   **New Precedents/Analysis:** The brief contrasts the Sixth Circuit's affirmation with the likely vacatur in the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, citing cases like *United States v. Pennington* and *United States v. Barnes* where sentences were vacated for relying predominantly on impermissible factors. This transforms the split from an abstract disagreement into a tangible difference in justice depending on geography.\n        *   **New Signal:** The inclusion of a quote from a Sixth Circuit district judge (\"I absolutely can punish him. . . . We do it all the time.\") provides a powerful anecdotal signal that the circuits are operating under fundamentally different legal regimes at the trial level.\n    *   **The Constitutional Argument is Now a Central Pillar:** The reply brief moves the constitutional avoidance argument from a secondary point to a primary reason for granting the petition.\n        *   **New Legal Framing:** It argues that the government's interpretation would render \u00a7 3583(e) unconstitutional by allowing new criminal punishments without the requisite constitutional safeguards.\n        *   **New Constitutional Precedents:** It explicitly invokes the right to a jury trial for sentences over six months (*Baldwin v. New York*) and the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition on multiple punishments (*Gamble v. United States*).\n        *   **Sharpened *Haymond* Analysis:** It directly applies Justice Breyer's controlling concurrence in *United States v. Haymond*, arguing that imposing punishment in a revocation hearing is precisely the kind of action that \"resembles the punishment of new criminal offenses\" without the required trial rights. The government's failure to address this in its opposition is highlighted as a significant omission.\n    *   **The \"Unworkability\" Argument is Rebutted:** The petitioner counters the government's claim that the proposed rule is unworkable by pointing to other circuits that already apply it without issue, citing *United States v. Wilcher* (7th Cir.) and *United States v. Burden* (2d Cir.).\n\n*   **Weakened Government Arguments:** The reply brief has significantly undermined the government's key reasons for denying certiorari. The claims that the split is superficial, has no practical effect, and that the petitioner's rule is unworkable have all been met with direct, evidence-based rebuttals. The government's silence on the constitutional issues now appears to be a critical weakness in its position.\n\n*   **Information Gap Filled & Confidence Update:** The primary information gap\u2014the petitioner's final word before the cert decision\u2014is now closed. The reply brief is not a mere restatement of the petition; it is a targeted and effective counter-attack. My confidence that the Supreme Court has compelling reasons to grant certiorari has substantially increased. The petitioner has successfully framed the case as involving a deep, outcome-determinative circuit split that also implicates fundamental constitutional rights\u2014two of the most powerful catalysts for Supreme Court review.",

This observation, an internal summary of my reasoning, solidifies my understanding based on the petitioner's reply brief and identifies the next critical information vector for my analysis. My beliefs have not changed in substance but have been consolidated and refined in terms of procedural posture.\n\n*   **Core Conflict (Stable):** The central legal dispute remains a clash between the petitioner's textualist and constitutional avoidance interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) and the government's more pragmatic, interconnected reading of the sentencing statutes. The petitioner's reply brief successfully framed this as Textualism & Constitutional Avoidance vs. Pragmatism & Statutory Interconnectedness.\n\n*   **Argument Strength Assessment (Stable):** My assessment that the petitioner's reply brief significantly strengthened their case for certiorari remains firm. The brief effectively:\n    *   **Demonstrated the Circuit Split's Practical Impact:** By using concrete examples like Petitioner Leaks and contrasting outcomes across circuits (*Pennington*, *Barnes*), it rebutted the government's claim that the split was minor. The quote from a Sixth Circuit judge (\"I absolutely can punish him...\") serves as a potent signal of a deep, operational divide.\n    *   **Elevated the Constitutional Avoidance Argument:** The brief successfully centered the argument on the potential unconstitutionality of the government's position, invoking *Baldwin v. New York* (jury trial rights), *Gamble v. United States* (Double Jeopardy), and, most critically, Justice Breyer's controlling concurrence in *United States v. Haymond*. The government's failure to address *Haymond* remains a significant perceived weakness.\n    *   **Rebutted the \"Unworkability\" Claim:** The petitioner effectively pointed to other circuits (*Wilcher*, *Burden*) that already apply the rule he advocates for, undermining the government's practical objections.\n\n*   **Information Gaps (Updated):**\n    *   **Closed Gap:** The information gap regarding the petitioner's final arguments before the cert decision is now closed. I have a comprehensive view of the legal arguments presented by both parties in the petition, the brief in opposition, and the reply.\n    *   **Newly Identified Gap:** My internal reasoning has identified a new, crucial information gap: the existence, source, and content of any *amicus curiae* (\"friend of the court\") briefs. The presence of amicus briefs, especially from influential groups like other states, legal scholars, or advocacy organizations (e.g., NACDL, ACLU), is a powerful signal to the Supreme Court that a case has importance beyond the immediate parties. The arguments within these briefs can also introduce new perspectives or data that influence the Justices' decision to grant review and, eventually, the merits.\n\n*   **Confidence & Prediction Posture (Refined):** My confidence that the Court has compelling reasons to grant certiorari is high, based on the petitioner's successful framing of a deep, outcome-determinative circuit split with constitutional implications. However, this confidence is now conditioned on the next piece of evidence. The presence of strong amicus support for the petitioner would substantially increase my confidence and solidify a prediction of \"grant.\" Conversely, the absence of any amicus support might temper my confidence slightly, suggesting the issue has not yet captured widespread attention, which is a factor the Court sometimes considers. My analysis is now poised to incorporate this next key signal.",

I have also confirmed a critical piece of information: no amicus curiae briefs have been filed. \n\nMy current belief state (\u03b8) is as follows:\n1.  **Pro-Cert Grant Factors:** There is a clear and acknowledged circuit split on a recurring question of federal sentencing law. The petitioner has presented a strong textualist argument, which is often favored by the current Court, and has also raised a plausible constitutional avoidance issue by invoking *United States v. Haymond*, which could attract conservative justices concerned with the expansion of non-jury judicial fact-finding.\n2.  **Anti-Cert Grant Factors:** The complete absence of amicus briefs is a significant negative signal. It suggests that major legal organizations (like the ACLU, NACDL), the federal government (in other contexts), or groups of law professors do not see this case as a vehicle of sufficient national importance to weigh in. This lack of external validation can diminish the Court's interest.\n\nMy primary uncertainty is no longer about the arguments in this specific case, but about how the Supreme Court weighs these competing factors. Is a clean circuit split on a statutory interpretation issue enough to grant cert, even with zero amicus support? To resolve this, I need to move from case-specific facts to general principles of the Court's behavior. \n\nMy next action should be to consult metadocuments to understand the predictive value of these signals.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's posture has been significantly refined by the latest observation, which directly addresses a previously identified information gap. While my core understanding of the legal arguments is stable, my assessment of the likelihood of Supreme Court review has been adjusted based on this new signal.\n\n*   **Core Conflict (Stable):** The central legal dispute remains a clash between the petitioner's textualist and constitutional avoidance interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) and the government's more pragmatic, interconnected reading of the sentencing statutes. The petitioner successfully framed this as Textualism & Constitutional Avoidance vs. Pragmatism & Statutory Interconnectedness.\n\n*   **Argument Strength Assessment (Stable):** My assessment of the petitioner's certiorari-stage briefing remains unchanged. The reply brief was highly effective in demonstrating the practical, outcome-determinative nature of the circuit split (citing *Pennington*, *Barnes*, and a Sixth Circuit judge's direct quote) and elevating the constitutional stakes by invoking *Haymond*, *Baldwin*, and *Gamble*. The government's failure to address Justice Breyer's controlling concurrence in *Haymond* continues to be a notable weakness in its opposition.\n\n*   **Information Gaps (Updated):**\n    *   **Closed Gap:** The critical information gap concerning the existence of *amicus curiae* briefs is now closed. The docket search confirms that **no amicus briefs have been filed** in this case.\n    *   **New Primary Gap:** With the briefing complete and the absence of amicus support confirmed, the primary information gap is now the Supreme Court's internal deliberations and its ultimate decision on the petition. The next key observation will be the Court's order list.\n\n*   **Confidence & Prediction Posture (Updated & Tempered):** The confirmation that no amicus briefs were filed is a significant new piece of evidence that directly impacts my prediction posture. As I reasoned previously, the presence of amicus support is a strong signal of a case's perceived national importance. Its absence here suggests that, despite the clear circuit split, the issue has not yet captured the attention of major legal organizations, scholars, or other stakeholders who might typically weigh in.\n\n    Therefore, my confidence that the Court will grant certiorari is **tempered**. While the petitioner's arguments regarding the deep circuit split and constitutional avoidance issues are strong on their own merits, the lack of external validation from amicus filers makes the case less compelling as a vehicle for the Court's limited attention. The case remains a plausible candidate for a grant, but the probability has decreased. My prediction is now more uncertain, leaning away from a confident \"grant\" and towards a more cautious \"watchful\" stance pending the Court's order.",

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to address a circuit split over what factors judges can consider when sentencing a person for violating conditions of supervised release, an issue estimated to affect thousands of defendants each year. The justices granted a petition for certiorari on Oct. 21 in three Sixth Circuit cases that upheld sentences for defendants who had violated their release conditions. The men \u2014 Edgardo Esteras, Timothy Michael Jaimez and Toriano A. Leaks Jr. \u2014 claim the court was wrong to allow their judges to consider three of the standard sentencing factors: the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, reflect the seriousness of the offense and provide just punishment for it. Those three considerations are baked into the sentencing rubric that Congress gave judges, but lawmakers left them out of the statute concerning what judges can consider when issuing a sentence for a supervised release violation. \"Congress drew a careful line instructing courts to rely on punishment and factors related to punishment only when sentencing defendants for their initial offenses, consistent with constitutional protections for those facing criminal punishment,\" the men said in their petition. \"The decisions below erased that line.\" The petition argued that the split among the appeals courts over what factors are permissible is \"deep and pervasive.\" The First, Second, Third, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that judges can consider the three factors despite their omission from the law, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have ruled that courts may not rely on them, according to the petition. The question could affect thousands of cases a year, the men said, pointing to the 108,000 federal supervision violations from 2013 to 2017, with 86% of those resulting in a new prison term. Congress' decision to carve out the three standard sentencing factors from the overall list that judges should consider when handing down sentences for violations of supervised release should be interpreted as a sign that lawmakers meant to take those items off the table, the men said. They told the justices that is exactly how they read the similar exclusion of factors for judges to weigh when imposing a term of supervised release, and the high court most recently affirmed that view in its 2022 opinion in Concepcion v. United States. The consideration of punishment factors in revocation sentencings also raises double-jeopardy concerns, the petition said, adding that a defendant could be doubly punished for the same conduct if the supervised release violation is a crime by itself and the judge ups the sentence for the infraction on account of a need to punish. In its opposition brief, the government said Congress' decision to list certain factors \u2014 and exclude others \u2014 for judges to consider when revoking supervised release and resentencing doesn't mean those items not listed must be disregarded by courts. The law's list shows a \"legislative judgment that the factors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a court must consider,\" the government said. The U.S. Department of Justice argued that the men overstated the alleged disagreement in the various circuits that have ruled on the same question, adding that any \"modest disagreement has little practical effect and does not warrant this court's review.\" Representatives for the parties were not immediately available for comment on Monday. Esteras, Jaimez and Leaks are represented by Joseph Medici and Kevin M. Schad of the Federal Public Defender for the Southern District of Ohio, and Stephen C. Newman and Christian J. Grostic of the Federal Public Defender of the Northern District of Ohio. The U.S. Department of Justice is represented by its own Elizabeth B. Prelogar, Nicole M. Argentieri and Thomas E. Booth.

Esteras v. United States, No. 23-7438 (June 20, 2025).Petitioner Edgardo Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute heroin and was sentenced to 12 months in prison followed by a 6-year term of supervised release, which was a downward variance to his 15-21 month sentencing range. While on supervised release, Esteras was arrested for domestic violence and other charges. The district court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and imposed 24 months of reimprisonment\u2014an upward variance from the advisory 6 to 12 month range\u2014explaining that Esteras\u2019s earlier sentence had been \u201crather lenient\u201d and that his revocation sentence must \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d a consideration enumerated in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). Esteras objected, arguing that the district court had impermissibly considered \u201cthe factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A).\" The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that a district court may consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.Justice Barrett delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Thomas, Kagan, and Kavanaugh, and in which Justices Sotomayor and Jackson joined as to all but Part II-B.\u00a0Sotomayor concurred separately in part, joined by Justice Jackson.\u00a0 Justice Jackson also concurred separately in part.\u00a0 Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Gorsuch.Writing for the majority, Justice Barret\u2019s opinion starts like this:A criminal sentence may include both time in prison and a term of supervised release. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73583(a). Supervised release comes with conditions\u2014for instance, the defendant must refrain from committing another crime. \u00a73583(d). If the defendant violates one of these conditions, then the district court may revoke the term of supervised release and require re-imprisonment. But a court may do so only \u201cafter considering\u201d an enumerated list of sentencing factors: those \u201cset forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d \u00a73583(e). Conspicuously missing from this list is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which directs a district court to consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d The Sixth Circuit held that a district court may consider that factor nonetheless.We disagree. Congress\u2019s decision to enumerate most of the sentencing factors while omitting \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) raises a strong inference that courts may not consider that factor when deciding whether to revoke a term of supervised release. This inference is consistent with both the statutory structure and the role that supervised release plays in the sentencing process. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of the Sixth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.Briefing is available on the Supreme Court\u2019s website.

While on supervised release,\nEsteras was arrested and charged with domestic violence and other crimes.  The District Court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release andordered 24 months of reimprisonment, explaining that Esteras\u2019s ear-\nlier sentence had been \u201crather lenient\u201d and that his revocation sen-\ntence must \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d a consideration enumeratedin 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding thata district court may consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised\nrelease. \nHeld : A district court considering whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s term \nof supervised release may not consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which covers \nretribution vis-\u00e0-vis the defendant\u2019 s underlying criminal offense. \nPp. 4\u201317.\n(a) In determining the appropriate sentence for a federal defendant,\na district court must consider 10 factors set forth in \u00a73553(a).  Amongthose factors is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which references \u201cthe need for the sen -\ntence imposed\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\nrespect for the law, and to provide ju st punishment for the offense.\u201d \nThis provision speaks to the re tributive purpose of punishment. \nA judge who imposes a term of imprisonment may also impose a\npost-imprisonment term of supervised release.  Section 3583(c) enu-\nmerates the factors that a court must consider when deciding to impose \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*Together with Jaimez, fka Watters  v. United States  and Leaks v. \nUnited States , also on certiorari to the sa me court (see this Court\u2019s Rule \n12.4). \n2 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \n  \nSyllabus \n supervised release.  Eight of the ten \u00a73553(a) factors are listed.  Sig-\nnificant here, \u00a73583(c) excludes \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which covers retribu-\ntion vis-\u00e0-vis the defendant\u2019s under lying criminal offense.  When a \ncourt decides whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised re-\nlease, \u00a73583(e) provides that the same eight factor s apply.  So the ques-\ntion is this: In determining whether to revoke supervised release, may \na district court account for these omitted factors\u2014and specifically \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)?  Esteras says no; the Government says yes.  Pp. 4\u20138. \n  (b) The Court agrees with Esteras.  District courts cannot consider \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.  That conclusion fol-lows from the well-established ca non of statutory interpretation\u2014\u201c ex-\npressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d\u2014which means that expressing one item of an associated group excludes  another item not mentioned.  See \nChevron U. S. A. Inc.  v. Echazabal , 536 U. S. 73, 80.  While Congress \nelsewhere set forth ten factors that must generally inform a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions, it provided in \u00a73583(e)\u2014the provision governing the revocation of supervised release\u2014that courts must con-\nsider only eight of those ten factors.   The natural implication is that \nCongress did not intend courts to co nsider the other two factors, in-\ncluding \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). \n The statutory structure confirms this negative inference.  Neighbor-\ning provisions governing the impositi on and revocation of other kinds \nof sentences instruct courts to consider all the \u00a73553(a) factors.  But \nfor supervised release\u2014and superv ised release only\u2014Congress omit-\nted \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  This is a distinction with a difference.  And Con-\ngress\u2019s decision to exclude retribution from the calculus also comports \nwith supervised release\u2019s role in the criminal justic e scheme.  Super-\nvised release \u201cis not a punishment in lieu of incarceration.\u201d  United \nStates v. Granderson , 511 U. S. 39, 50.  Rather , it \u201cfulfills rehabilita-\ntive ends\u201d and \u201cprovides individuals with postconfinement assistance.\u201d  \nUnited States  v. Johnson , 529 U. S. 53, 59\u201360.  So when a defendant \nviolates a condition of supervised release, courts must consider the for-\nward-looking  sentencing ends, but may not consider the backward-\nlooking  purpose of retribution. \n  The Court has twice interpreted th e omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from \nthe provision governing th e imposition of supervised release to mean \nthat district courts may not consider that factor.  See Tapia  v. United \nStates, 564 U. S. 319; Concepcion  v. United States, 597 U. S. 481.  Alt-\nhough Tapia and Concepcion  both deal with the imposition of super-\nvised release under \u00a73583(c), the same reasoning applies to revocation under \u00a73583(e): the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) means that courts may not consider it.  Pp. 8\u201310. \n  (c) The Government\u2019s counterarguments are unpersuasive.  The \nGovernment reads the exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from \u00a73583(e) to \n  \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nSyllabus \nmean that district courts must  consider enumerated factors and need \nnot (but may) consider unenumerated ones.  Given sentencing judges\u2019 \ndiscretion, the Government argues, Congress would have been more \nexplicit had it intended to forecl ose the consideration of retributive \naims when revoking supervised release. But what Congress said is\nclear: The itemized list in \u00a73583(e)  is exhaustive and supplies the en-\ntire universe of factors courts ma y consider.  And the Government\u2019s \nreading trivializes the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A): As the Governmentrecognizes, a court may \u201cconsider\u201d an enumerated factor but give it no \nweight.  Yet there is negligible di fference between saying that a court \nmust consider a given factor (but may give it no weight) and saying \nthat a court may consider a given factor (i f the court so chooses). \nNext, the Government argues that Esteras\u2019s reading is unworkable\nbecause considering other enumerat ed factors\u2014such as \u201cthe nature\nand circumstances of the offense\u201d under \u00a73553(a)(1)\u2014will necessarily \nimply consideration of the retributive principles captured by\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  While the Government asks how a court may consider \nthe nature and circumstances of th e offense without also considering \nthe retributive principles captured by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), the answer is \nstraightforward.  Courts may consider the offense\u2019s nature and circum -\nstances to inform the considerations set forth in \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C),and (D)\u2014deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.  But courts \ncannot consider them as relevant to \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retributive focus. \nFinally, the Government interprets \u00a73583(g), which mandates  revo-\ncation in certain circumstances, as subject to the full list of \u00a73553(a) factors.  And it would be anomalou s, the Government says, if courts \ncould consider retribution in mandatory revocations under \u00a73583(g) \nbut not in discretionary  revocations under \u00a73583(e)(3). The correct \nreading of \u00a73583(g) does not affect the Court\u2019s analysis.  That \u00a73583(e) might operate differently from \u00a735 83(g) is no reason to disregard \n\u00a73583(e)\u2019s plain meaning.

UNITED STATES \nTORIANO A. LEAKS, J R., PETITIONER v. \nUNITED STATES \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n[June 20, 2025]\n JUSTICE BARRETT  delivered the opinion of the Court. \nA criminal sentence may include both time in prison and \na term of supervised release.  18 U. S. C. \u00a73583(a).  Super-\nvised release comes with conditions\u2014for instance, the de-\nfendant must refrain from committing another crime. \n\u00a73583(d). If the defendant violates one of these conditions, then the district court may revo ke the term of supervised\nrelease and require reimprisonme nt.  But a court may do so\nonly \u201cafter considering\u201d an enumerated list of sentencing \nfactors: those \u201cset forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B),\n(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  \u00a73583(e).Conspicuously missing from this list is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A),\nwhich directs a district court to consider \u201cthe need for the \nsentence imposed\u201d \u201cto reflect th e seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punish -\nment for the offense.\u201d The Sixth Circuit held that a district court may consider that factor nonetheless. \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 2 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nWe disagree.  Congress\u2019s decision to enumerate most of \nthe sentencing factors while omitting \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) raises \na strong inference that courts  may not consider that factor \nwhen deciding whether to revo ke a term of supervised re -\nlease. This inference is consistent with both the statutory structure and the role that supervised release plays in the\nsentencing process. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments\nof the Sixth Circuit and remand for further proceedings. \nI \nIn 2018, Edgardo Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to\ndistribute heroin. Varying downward from the 15-to-21-month sentencing range, the District Court sentenced him \nto 12 months in prison, to be followed by a 6-year term of \nsupervised release.\nWhen Esteras completed his term of imprisonment, his \nperiod of supervised release began. Three years in, the pro -\nbation office notified the District Court that Esteras had \nbeen arrested. According to the mother of his children,\nEsteras had threatened to kill her and had fired three \nrounds into her vehicle. Este ras was charged in municipal \ncourt with domestic violence , aggravated menacing, and \ncriminal damaging, although the charges were ultimatelydismissed at the request of the victim. \nThe District Court held a revo cation hearing, at which it \nfound that Esteras had violated the conditions of his super-\nvised release. The District Court remarked that Esteras \nwas \u201cno stranger to law violations and no stranger to fed-\neral court\u201d and that his previous drug sentences had been \n\u201crather lenient.\u201d App. 96a. The District Court revoked his \nsupervised release and ordered 24 months of reimprison-\nment, an upward variation from  the advisory 6-to-12-month \nrange, with three more years of supervised release to follow. \nAt this point, Esteras\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the\nDistrict Court had impermissibly considered \u201cthe factor in \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  3 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d Id., at 105a.  While Esteras\u2019s coun-\nsel lodged his objection for th e record, he recognized that\nSixth Circuit precedent allows district courts to consider\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking a term of supervised release.\nSee United States v. Lewis , 498 F. 3d 393, 399\u2013400 (2007).\nThe District Court in turn acknowledged that part of its de -\ncision \u201ccertainly [was] the need for the sentence imposed, to\npromote respect for the law.\u201d  App. 105a.  In a subsequent written order, the District Court explained that it had \u201ccon -\nsidered the factors and conditio ns for sentencing listed in\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)\u201d and had imposed the term of reimpris-\nonment in part to \u201cpromote  respect for the law.\u201d  Id. , at \n115a\u2013116a. \nThe Sixth Circuit affirmed, providing two justifications \nfor its view that district courts may consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) \nwhen revoking a term of supervised release.  See 88 F. 4th \n1163 (2023).  First, \u00a73583(e) does not say \u201cthat the court \nmay consider \u2018 only\u2019 those factors\u201d specifically enumerated, \nso there was no indication that Congress meant to displace the \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d that district courts typicallyenjoy \u201cover supervised-release decisions.\u201d  Id., at 1167.  Sec-\nond, a rule prohibiting district courts from considering \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) would be unworkable.  As the panel saw it,\n\u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations mentioned in \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redundant\u2019 with the permitted ones,\u201d so \u201c[t]o think about the one requires the \njudge to think about the other.\u201d  Ibid . (quoting Lewis , 498 \nF. 3d, at 400).\nThe circuits are divided as to whether district courts may\nconsider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking a term of supervised release.\n1 We granted certiorari to resolve this split.  604 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1In addition to the Sixth Circuit, th e First, Second, and Third Circuits \nhave held that district courts may consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).

In determining the appropri-\nate sentence, the court must consider certain factors set \nforth in \u00a73553(a). Some are obvious: The court must con-sider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u201cthe \nhistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cthe \nkinds of sentences available.\u201d  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1), (3).  Others re-quire courts to consider guidelines or policies issued by the \nSentencing Commission.  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(4)\u2013(5).  And still others \nreflect discrete policy aims, such as \u201cthe need to avoid un -\nwarranted sentence disparities\u201d among similarly situateddefendants and \u201cthe need to provide restitution to any vic-tims of the offense.\u201d  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(6)\u2013(7).\nWhile all these factors are important, \u00a73553(a)(2) cap-\ntures the traditional heartland of criminal sentencing.  It \nrequires courts to consider: \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nNinth, and Tenth Circuits have held that a court may not consider \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  See United States v. Crudup , 461 F. 3d 433, 439 (CA4 \n2006); United States v. Miqbel , 444 F. 3d 1173, 1182 (CA9 2006); United \nStates v. Booker, 63 F. 4th 1254, 1259\u20131260 (CA10 2023).  The Fifth and \nSeventh Circuits have taken intermediate positions.  See United States \nv. Sanchez , 900 F. 3d 678, 684, and n. 5 (CA5 2011) (while \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\nis an impermissible factor for a district court to consider, \u201cthe forbidden factor must be \u2018dominant\u2019 \u201d to constitute reversible error); United States \nv.

Jaimez and Leaks, like Esteras, argued that the District Courts in their revocation proceedings  had improperly considered \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A).

United States , 564 U. S. \n319, 325 (2011). They speak to the questions at the core of any system of criminal justice: What sentence does the de-\nfendant deserve? What sentence will deter criminal con-\nduct in the future?  What sentence will protect the public?And what sentence is most likely to help the defendant re-\nhabilitate for transition back into society? \nA judge who imposes a term of imprisonment may\u2014and \nsometimes must\u2014impose a postimprisonment term of su-\npervised release.  \u00a73583(a).  \u201cSupervised release is \u2018a formof postconfinement monitoring \u2019 that permits a defendant a\nkind of conditional liberty by allowing him to serve part of his sentence outside of prison,\u201d subject to conditions on his behavior. Mont  v. United States , 587 U. S. 514, 523 (2019) \n(quoting Johnson  v. United States , 529 U. S. 694, 697 \n(2000)). Some conditions are mandatory, such as requiring \nthat the defendant not commit additional crimes and, in \nmost cases, that the defendant submit to drug testing.\n\u00a73583(d). Others are up to the discretion of the court.  Ibid. \nWhen a court \u201cdetermin[es] whether to include a term of \nsupervised release,\u201d as well as the length and conditions of \nsuch a term, it must \u201cconsider the factors set forth in section \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n 6 ESTERAS v.

Only two of the \u00a73553(a) factors are \nabsent from this list. The first is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which re-quires the court to consider the need for the sentence im-\nposed to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the \noffense,\u201d i.e., the retributive purposes of sentencing.  The \nsecond is \u00a73553(a)(3), which re quires the court to consider \n\u201cthe kinds of sentences available.\u201d  When a court decides whether to revoke  a defendant\u2019s supervised release, the very \nsame subset of \u00a73553(a) factors\u2014that is, all but two\u2014ap -\nplies. \u00a73583(e)(3).\n3 \nThe reason for excluding \u00a73553(a)(3) from the list is self-\nevident: When a district court decides whether to revoke a \nterm of supervised release, there is no need to consider \u201cthe\nkinds of sentences available,\u201d because supervised release is\nthe only matter at issue.4  The exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3The same list of factors also applies when a district court modifies the \nterms of supervised release, such as by terminating supervised release \nearly, by extending the term of superv ised release, or by altering the con-\nditions of supervised release.  \u00a7\u00a73583(e)(1)\u2013(2), (4). \n4The dissent offers a different view of  \u00a73553(a)(3).  In its view, the ter-\nmination, extension, modification, an d revocation of supervised release \nare all different \u201ckinds of \u201d sentences. Post, at 7\u20138 (opinion of A LITO, J.). \nThe Government never makes this ar gument\u2014and for good reason.  To \nbegin, it is textually implausible.  As the statute articulates, there are \nthree \u201ckinds of sentences available\u201d fo r an individual \u201cfound guilty of an \noffense\u201d: \u201ca term of probation,\u201d \u201ca fi ne,\u201d and \u201ca term of imprisonment.\u201d \n\u00a7\u00a73551(b)(1)\u2013(3); \u00a73553(a)(3).  In fact, a term of supervised release is not itself a \u201csentence\u201d at all; it is a component of a defendant\u2019s prison sen-\ntence.  See \u00a73583(a) (\u201cThe court, in imposing a sentence to a term of im -\nprisonment  . . . , may include as a part of the sentence  a requirement that \nthe defendant be placed on a term of  supervised release after imprison-\nment\u201d (emphasis added)).  Thus, to th e extent the dissent thinks that the \ntermination, extension, modification, and revocation of supervised re-\nlease are different \u201ckinds of sentences available\u201d to the court, it is mis-taken.  \u00a73553(a)(3). \nThe dissent\u2019s interpretation is perp lexing for another reason too: It \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 7 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nmore significant\u2014and here, con troversial.  Esteras argues\nthat district courts cannot  consider the retributive purpose \narticulated in \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised re-\nlease. The Government insists that courts can consider it, \nalthough they are not required to do so. \nB \nTo see what is at stake, k eep in mind that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) \ndoes not speak of retribution generally\u2014it references theneed for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the of-\nfense \u201d and to \u201cprovide just punishment for the offense .\u201d \n(Emphasis added.) In the context of a revocation hearing,\nthe \u201coffense\u201d is the underlying crime of conviction, not the \nviolation of the supervised-release conditions.  The opening \nprovision of Title 18\u2019s sentencing chapter clearly uses \u201cof-\nfense\u201d to refer to a criminal conviction.  See \u00a73551(a) (stat-ing that the sentencing provisions apply to \u201ca defendant \nwho has been found guilty of an offense described in any \nFederal statute\u201d). Yet condu ct that constitutes a violation \nof supervised release \u201cneed not be criminal.\u201d Johnson , 529 \nU. S., at 700; see, e.g., \u00a73583(g)(3) (mandating revocation\nwhen a defendant fails to comp ly with drug testing imposed \nas a condition of release).  Furthermore, neighboring provi-sions in \u00a73583 consistently use the word \u201coffense\u201d to refer \nto the defendant\u2019s original cri me of conviction, while using \nthe word \u201cviolation\u201d to refer to  the conduct that triggers rev -\nocation. Compare \u00a73583(e)(3) (referencing the \u201coffense that \nresulted in the term of supervised release\u201d); \u00a73583(h) (\u201cthe offense that resulted in the original term of supervised re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ntreats Congress\u2019s omission of \u00a73553(a)(3) from the set of factors that gov-\nern revocation proceedings as nothing more than an inexplicable drafting \nerror; under its view, not only may district courts consider \u00a73553(a)(3), \nthey must do so. See post, at 7 (a judge \u201cmust consider exactly what is \nset out in \u00a73553(a)(3)\u201d).

This con-\nclusion follows directly from the application of a well-\nestablished canon of statutory interpretation: \u201cexpressio \nunius est exclusio alterius\u201d\u2014in plain English, \u201c \u2018expressing\none item of [an] associated group or series excludes anotherleft unmentioned.\u2019 \u201d  Chevron U.

Here, \u00a73553(a) lays\nout 10 factors that inform a di strict court\u2019s sentencing deci-\nsion.\n6  Section 3583(e) provides that a district court may re-\nvoke a term of supervised release \u201cafter considering\u201d 8 of \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5Because \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) speaks only  to the \u201coffense,\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d \nhere can mean only the underlying cr iminal conviction, we address only \nwhether \u00a73583(e) precludes the court from considering retribution for the\nunderlying criminal conviction.  \u201cOffens e\u201d aside, the Government argues \nthat \u00a73553(a)(4)(B) and \u00a73553(a)(5) authorize courts to consider policystatements issued by the Sentencing Commission that sound in retribu-tion for the violation of the conditions of the supervised release . See Brief \nfor United States 11, 34; \u00a73583(e) (requiring courts to consider \u00a73553(a)(4) and \u00a73553(a)(5)).

We take no position on whether this is a pe rmissible consideration. \n6For those counting: the six factors enumerated in \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1), (3), \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n 9 Cite as: 606 U.

The natural implication is that Congress\ndid not intend for courts to consider the other two factors, \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) and \u00a73553(a)(3).  Indeed, the expressio unius\ncanon has particular force here because the \u00a73553(a) sen-\ntencing factors constitute an \u201ce stablished series,\u201d such that \nany \u201comission\u201d from that series necessarily \u201cbespeaks anegative implication.\u201d Chevron U.

And the fact that Congress included almost the entire\nlist makes the exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) and \u00a73553(a)(3) all the more glaring.\nThe statutory structure confirms this negative inference. \nNeighboring provisions that govern the imposition and rev-\nocation of sentences other than supervised release instruct the court to consider all the factors in \u00a73553(a).  For in-\nstance, when imposing a term of probation, the court \u201cshall\nconsider the factors set forth in \u00a73553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable.\u201d  \u00a73562(a).

So for supervised release\u2014and for\nsupervised release only\u2014Congress omitted \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).\nThis, we think, is a distinction with a difference. After all, \nour task is to \u201cgive effect to, not nullify Congress\u2019 choice toinclude\u201d that factor \u201cin some provisions but not others.\u201d \nGallardo  v. Marstiller , 596 U. S. 420, 431 (2022). \nCongress\u2019s decision to exclude retribution from the calcu-\nlus also comports with the role of supervised release in our\ncurrent criminal justice scheme.  Fines, probation, and im-\nprisonment are a court\u2019s primary tools for ensuring that a criminal defendant receives just deserts for the original of-\nfense. Supervised release, by contrast, \u201cis not a punish-\nment in lieu of incarceration.\u201d United States  v. Granderson , \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n(4), (5), (6), and (7), plus the fo ur factors separately enumerated in \n\u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(D). \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n   \n  \n 10 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \n511 U. S. 39, 50 (1994).  Rather, it \u201cfulfills rehabilitative \nends\u201d and \u201cprovides individuals with postconfinement as-\nsistance.\u201d United States v. Johnson , 529 U. S. 53, 59\u201360 \n(2000). So when a defendant violates the conditions of his \nsupervised release, it makes sense that a court must con-\nsider the forward-looking ends of sentencing (deterrence,\nincapacitation, and rehabilitation), but may not consider the backward-looking purpose of retribution.\nFinally, our conclusion is consistent with this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. We have twice interpreted the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the provision governing the imposition\nof supervised release (\u00a73583(c)) to mean that district courts\nmay not consider that factor when imposing supervised re -\nlease. In Tapia , we stated that, \u201cwhen imposing a term of \nsupervised release,\u201d \u201ca court may not take account of retri-\nbution (the first purpose listed in \u00a73553(a)(2)).\u201d  564 U. S., at 326.\n7  S o  t o o , i n Concepcion  v. United States , we re-\nmarked that \u201cin determining whether to include a term of \nsupervised release, and the length of any such term, Con-\ngress has expressly precluded di strict courts from consider -\ning the need for retribution.\u201d 597 U. S. 481, 494 (2022).  Alt-hough Tapia and Concepcion both deal with the imposition \nof supervised release under \u00a73583(c), the same reasoning \napplies to the revocation of supervised release under\n\u00a73583(e): The omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list of fac-\ntors means that courts may not consider it. \nText, structure, and precedent all point in the same di-\nrection: Congress\u2019s decision to exclude \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from\u00a73583(e)\u2019s list of sentencing factors means that district \ncourts cannot consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when deciding\nwhether to revoke supervised release. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7The dissent suggests that when we said that \u201c \u2018a court may not take \naccount of retribution,\u2019 \u201d we may have actually meant that \u201ca judge, as a \nmatter of discretion, may choose not to take retribution into account.\u201d \nPost, at 14. We leave it to the reader to judge whether this is a plausible\ninterpretation. \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 11 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nWe are unpersuaded by the Government\u2019s and the dis-\nsent\u2019s counterarguments. Fi rst, the Government and the \ndissent read the exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) as supporting a \ndifferent inference\u2014namely,  that a district court must con-\nsider the enumerated factors but need not  consider the un-\nenumerated ones, such as \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  Because \u201csen-\ntencing judges \u2018enjo[y] discretion in the sort of information they may consider,\u2019 \u201d the Government argues, Congress \nwould have used more explicit  language had it wanted to\nforeclose courts from consider ing retribution when revoking\nsupervised release. Concepcion , 597 U. S., at 491 (quoting \nDean  v. United States , 581 U. S. 62, 66 (2017); alteration in \noriginal). For example, Congress could have said that courts may revoke supervised release \u201cafter considering only\u201d the enumerated factors. Brief for United States 23; \nsee also post, at 4\u20136 (A\nLITO, J., dissenting).\nWhen interpretive disputes arise, it is easy to imagine \nhow Congress could have drafted the statute to avoid them.But Congress cannot anticipate (much less account for)\nevery future statutory skirmi sh\u2014and even if it could, \ncourts have no authority to hold Congress to a \u201cperfect as \nwe see it\u201d standard of drafting.  On the contrary, we have\n\u201croutinely construed statutes to have a particular meaning\u201d \neven when \u201cCongress could have expressed itself more\nclearly.\u201d Luna Torres  v. Lynch, 578 U. S. 452, 472 (2016).\nWhat Congress said here gets its point across just fine: The \nitemized list in \u00a73583(e) is exhaustive.  As we explained, the\nprovision allows district courts to consider all but two of the \n\u00a73553(a) factors, and because one is inapplicable in this con -\ntext (\u00a73553(a)(3)), \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is the only consequentialomission.  So it makes sense to read \u00a73583(e) as supplyingthe universe of factors that the district court can consider. \nAnd while the Government is right that district courts gen-\nerally enjoy discretion over sentencing, see Brief for United\nStates 21\u201322, Congress chose to limit that discretion here. \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nIt makes much less sense to read \u00a73583(e) as the Govern-\nment does\u2014that is, as listing only the factors that a court must consider, while leaving room for the court to consider\nan additional factor if it so ch ooses.  This reading of \u00a73583(e)\ntrivializes the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  After all, on the Government\u2019s view, a court may \u201cconsider\u201d an enumerated \nfactor but give it no weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 61.  The differ-\nence between saying that a court must consider a given fac-\ntor (but may give it no weig ht) and saying that a court may\nconsider a given factor (if the court chooses) is negligible. \nWhy would Congress have bothered to exclude \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list?\nThe dissent has no response to this point, so it instead \nanalogizes to different\u2014and inapposite\u2014contexts. For ex-ample, the dissent says, suppose that a law clerk is directed\nto complete a certain number of bench memos before a\ndeadline; surely that instruction would not carry the infer-\nence that the law clerk may no t complete more work too. \nPost, at 5. But the important difference between that con-\ntext and this one is that sentencing considerations, unlike bench memos, can be zero sum: Adding a new consideration \nto the mix reduces the role that the enumerated considera-\ntions play. In fact, the new consideration might lead to a different result altogether.\nA play on the dissent\u2019s own analogy reveals its weak-\nnesses. Imagine that a judge tells her hypothetical law \nclerk to prepare a bench memo with a recommendation \nformed \u201cafter considering\u201d statutory text, context, and structure, as well as any relevant precedent.  Having looked\nat these sources, the law clerk is inclined to recommend \nthat the judge reverse the court below.  But the law clerk \ndecides to look elsewhere\u2014say, to social science studies\u2014\nand she uses these sources to inform her recommendation. In the end, she submits a memo recommending that the \njudge vote to affirm the lower court\u2019s decision. According to \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n   \n \n \n  13 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nthe dissent, the law clerk has obeyed her boss\u2019s instruc-\ntions. Needless to say, we disagree. \nMore to the point, the di ssent never explains why Con-\ngress omitted \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list of considerations applicable to a revocation proceeding. After all, in the dis-\nsent\u2019s view, district courts will almost inevitably consider \nthat factor. See post, at 3\u20134, 8\u201311, 12\u201313, n. 7.  So why did\nCongress exclude it? In the dissent\u2019s view, the omission is \njust hortatory: \u201cCongress may have sought to encourage \nsentencing courts to give gr eater weight to the remaining\npurposes of sentencing.\u201d Post, at 12\u201313, n. 7.\n8  But omitting\nconsideration of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) altogether would be an odd way of accomplishing that very limited goal.  And one need not \u201clive in a world of airy abstractions,\u201d post, at 1, to rec-\nognize that Congress\u2019s drafting  decisions have significance. \nNext, the Government and the dissent argue that\nEsteras\u2019s reading of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is unworkable, because consideration of the other e numerated factors will neces-\nsarily imply consideration of the retributive principles cap-tured by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). The Government relies primarilyon \u00a73553(a)(1), which references \u201cthe nature and circum -\nstances of the offense.\u201d  How, the Government asks, is a court to consider the nature and circumstances of the of-fense without also considering the \u201cneed for the sentence\nimposed\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriou sness of the offense, to pro-\nmote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment forthe offense\u201d ?  \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).\nThe answer is straightforward.  A court may consider the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8Alternatively, the dissent posits that Congress may have understood\neach of the three \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) factors to \u201capply in some, though not all, \nhearings regarding the alterati on of supervised release.\u201d  Post, at 12\u201313, \nn. 7. Which hearings make the cut?  Frankly, we are not sure.  Some \nparts of the dissent\u2019s lengthy footnote suggest all; others suggest none; and still others suggest that it \u201cdepends on context.\u201d  Ibid.   In our view, \nhowever, \u201c[t]he Sentencing Reform Act does not place district judges in\nsuch a predicament.\u201d  Post, at 1\u20132. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n 14 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nnature and circumstances of the offense as relevant for the \nconsiderations set forth in \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C), and (D)\u2014\nnamely, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation\u2014buta court cannot consider the nature and circumstances of the \noffense as relevant to \u00a73553(a)(2 )(A)\u2019s retributive focus.  For \ninstance, if the defendant\u2019s original offense was particularlyviolent, that fact might inform the court\u2019s judgment as to\nwhether revocation is necessary \u201cto protect the public fromfurther crimes of the defendant.\u201d  \u00a73553(a)(2)(C).  But the \ncourt could not revoke based on  the view that, given the vi -\nolent nature of the underlying offense, the defendant de-\nserves additional punishment.\n9 \nThe dissent, for its part, argues that we are simply wrong \nto understand \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) as synonymous with retribu-\ntion. Post, at 8\u201311. Under the dissent\u2019s view, \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) serves an extensive (if amorphous) role: The phrase \u201c \u2018to promote respect for the law\u2019 \u201d encompasses \u201cthe\nwhole point of deterrence,\u201d while the reference to the \u201c \u2018seri-\nousness of the offense\u2019 \u201d invokes the \u201cheightened need for\ndeterrence and incapacitation.\u201d Post, at 8\u20139. But this ap-\nproach renders \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) largely duplicative of the clear references to deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabili-\ntation that follow in \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C), and (D). Recall, too, that there are four traditional purposes of sentencing. \nGiven that \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C), and(D) set forth three of \nthese purposes, it is no wond er that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) provides \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9The dissent suggests that this will be an impossible task for district \ncourts. See post, at 1 (Courts must \u201cengage in  mind-bending exercises\u201d); \npost, at 10 (They must \u201cprobe their ment al processes to ensure that no \nthoughts of retribution entered in\u201d); post, at 11 (We require a \u201csoul-\nsearching obligation\u201d). Not so.  We ro utinely require judges and juries to \nattend to some considerations while ignoring others.  See, e.g., Samia v. \nUnited States , 599 U. S. 635, 646 (2023) (\u201cEvidence at trial is often ad -\nmitted for a limited purpose, accompan ied by a limiting instruction,\u201d and \n\u201cour legal system presumes that jurors will \u2018 \u201cattend closely the particu-\nlar language of [such] instructions in a criminal case and strive to under-\nstand, make sense of, and follow\u201d \u2019 them\u201d (alteration in original)). \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 Cite as: 606 U.

Not to mention that  the provision speaks in re-\ntributive terms: the \u201cseriousness of the offense,\u201d the need \n\u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d and, in particular, the need\u201cto provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). In any event, we say nothing about the\nmeaning of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) today that we have not already\nsaid before.  See Tapia , 564 U. S., at 326 (\u201cretribution\u201d is\n\u201cthe first purpose listed in \u00a73553(a)(2)\u201d); Concepcion , 597 \nU. S., at 494. \nFinally, the Government suggests that \u00a73583(g), which \nmandates  revocation in certain circumstances, undermines \nEsteras\u2019s interpretation of the statute.  Section 3583(g) does\nnot specify which factors apply when a court determines the \nlength of the defendant\u2019s postrevocation term of imprison-ment.\n10  So, the Government reasons, reimprisonment un-\nder \u00a73583(g) must be subject to the general rule for prison \nsentences articulated in \u00a73582(a), and that provision di-\nrects courts to the full list of \u00a73553(a) factors.  It would be \nanomalous, the Government says, if a district court could \nconsider retribution as part of a mandatory  revocation un-\nder \u00a73583(g) but not as part of a discretionary  revocation \nunder \u00a73583(e)(3).  Esteras, for his part, argues for con-sistency in the other direction: He argues that \u00a73583(e)\u2019s\nabbreviated list governs in both contexts.\nWe need not resolve the dispute because it does not affect\nour analysis. To begin, the Government\u2019s reading of\u00a73583(e) does not solve the problem that the Government\nhas identified. As the Government sees it, if revocation is \ndiscretionary and thus gove rned by \u00a73583(e), the court may\nconsider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), but if revocation is mandatory and thus governed by \u00a73583(g), the court must consider \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n10Section 3583(g) states that, if the defendant violates certain condi-\ntions of supervised release, \u201cthe court shall revoke the term of supervised \nrelease and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment not \nto exceed the maximum term of impr isonment authorized under subsec-\ntion (e)(3).\u201d (Emphasis added.) \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n 16 ESTERAS v.

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to address a circuit split over what factors judges can consider when sentencing a person for violating conditions of supervised release, an issue estimated to affect thousands of defendants each year. The justices granted a petition for certiorari on Oct. 21 in three Sixth Circuit cases that upheld sentences for defendants who had violated their release conditions. The men \u2014 Edgardo Esteras, Timothy Michael Jaimez and Toriano A. Leaks Jr. \u2014 claim the court was wrong to allow their judges to consider three of the standard sentencing factors: the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, reflect the seriousness of the offense and provide just punishment for it. Those three considerations are baked into the sentencing rubric that Congress gave judges, but lawmakers left them out of the statute concerning what judges can consider when issuing a sentence for a supervised release violation. \"Congress drew a careful line instructing courts to rely on punishment and factors related to punishment only when sentencing defendants for their initial offenses, consistent with constitutional protections for those facing criminal punishment,\" the men said in their petition. \"The decisions below erased that line.\" The petition argued that the split among the appeals courts over what factors are permissible is \"deep and pervasive.\" The First, Second, Third, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that judges can consider the three factors despite their omission from the law, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have ruled that courts may not rely on them, according to the petition. The question could affect thousands of cases a year, the men said, pointing to the 108,000 federal supervision violations from 2013 to 2017, with 86% of those resulting in a new prison term. Congress' decision to carve out the three standard sentencing factors from the overall list that judges should consider when handing down sentences for violations of supervised release should be interpreted as a sign that lawmakers meant to take those items off the table, the men said. They told the justices that is exactly how they read the similar exclusion of factors for judges to weigh when imposing a term of supervised release, and the high court most recently affirmed that view in its 2022 opinion in Concepcion v. United States. The consideration of punishment factors in revocation sentencings also raises double-jeopardy concerns, the petition said, adding that a defendant could be doubly punished for the same conduct if the supervised release violation is a crime by itself and the judge ups the sentence for the infraction on account of a need to punish. In its opposition brief, the government said Congress' decision to list certain factors \u2014 and exclude others \u2014 for judges to consider when revoking supervised release and resentencing doesn't mean those items not listed must be disregarded by courts. The law's list shows a \"legislative judgment that the factors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a court must consider,\" the government said. The U.S. Department of Justice argued that the men overstated the alleged disagreement in the various circuits that have ruled on the same question, adding that any \"modest disagreement has little practical effect and does not warrant this court's review.\" Representatives for the parties were not immediately available for comment on Monday. Esteras, Jaimez and Leaks are represented by Joseph Medici and Kevin M. Schad of the Federal Public Defender for the Southern District of Ohio, and Stephen C. Newman and Christian J. Grostic of the Federal Public Defender of the Northern District of Ohio. The U.S. Department of Justice is represented by its own Elizabeth B. Prelogar, Nicole M. Argentieri and Thomas E. Booth. The case is Esteras et al. v United States, case number 23-7483, in the U.S. Supreme Court. --Editing by Melissa Treolo. For a reprint of this article, please contact reprints@law360.com.

Esteras v. United States, No. 23-7438 (June 20, 2025).Petitioner Edgardo Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute heroin and was sentenced to 12 months in prison followed by a 6-year term of supervised release, which was a downward variance to his 15-21 month sentencing range. While on supervised release, Esteras was arrested for domestic violence and other charges. The district court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and imposed 24 months of reimprisonment\u2014an upward variance from the advisory 6 to 12 month range\u2014explaining that Esteras\u2019s earlier sentence had been \u201crather lenient\u201d and that his revocation sentence must \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d a consideration enumerated in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). Esteras objected, arguing that the district court had impermissibly considered \u201cthe factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A).\" The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that a district court may consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.Justice Barrett delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Thomas, Kagan, and Kavanaugh, and in which Justices Sotomayor and Jackson joined as to all but Part II-B.\u00a0Sotomayor concurred separately in part, joined by Justice Jackson.\u00a0 Justice Jackson also concurred separately in part.\u00a0 Justice Alito dissented, joined by Justice Gorsuch.Writing for the majority, Justice Barret\u2019s opinion starts like this:A criminal sentence may include both time in prison and a term of supervised release. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73583(a). Supervised release comes with conditions\u2014for instance, the defendant must refrain from committing another crime. \u00a73583(d). If the defendant violates one of these conditions, then the district court may revoke the term of supervised release and require re-imprisonment. But a court may do so only \u201cafter considering\u201d an enumerated list of sentencing factors: those \u201cset forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d \u00a73583(e). Conspicuously missing from this list is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which directs a district court to consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d The Sixth Circuit held that a district court may consider that factor nonetheless.We disagree. Congress\u2019s decision to enumerate most of the sentencing factors while omitting \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) raises a strong inference that courts may not consider that factor when deciding whether to revoke a term of supervised release. This inference is consistent with both the statutory structure and the role that supervised release plays in the sentencing process. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of the Sixth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.Briefing is available on the Supreme Court\u2019s website.

See United States  v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,  200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE SIXTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 23\u20137483. Argued February 25, 2025\u2014Decided June 20, 2025* \nEdgardo Esteras pleaded guilty to cons piring to distribute heroin, and \nthe District Court sentenced him to 12 months in prison followed by a \n6-year term of supervised release.  While on supervised release,\nEsteras was arrested and charged with domestic violence and other crimes.  The District Court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release andordered 24 months of reimprisonment, explaining that Esteras\u2019s ear-\nlier sentence had been \u201crather lenient\u201d and that his revocation sen-\ntence must \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d a consideration enumeratedin 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding thata district court may consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised\nrelease. \nHeld : A district court considering whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s term \nof supervised release may not consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which covers \nretribution vis-\u00e0-vis the defendant\u2019 s underlying criminal offense. \nPp. 4\u201317.\n(a) In determining the appropriate sentence for a federal defendant,\na district court must consider 10 factors set forth in \u00a73553(a).  Amongthose factors is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which references \u201cthe need for the sen -\ntence imposed\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\nrespect for the law, and to provide ju st punishment for the offense.\u201d \nThis provision speaks to the re tributive purpose of punishment. \nA judge who imposes a term of imprisonment may also impose a\npost-imprisonment term of supervised release.  Section 3583(c) enu-\nmerates the factors that a court must consider when deciding to impose \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*Together with Jaimez, fka Watters  v. United States  and Leaks v. \nUnited States , also on certiorari to the sa me court (see this Court\u2019s Rule \n12.4). \n2 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \n  \nSyllabus \n supervised release.  Eight of the ten \u00a73553(a) factors are listed.  Sig-\nnificant here, \u00a73583(c) excludes \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which covers retribu-\ntion vis-\u00e0-vis the defendant\u2019s under lying criminal offense.  When a \ncourt decides whether to revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised re-\nlease, \u00a73583(e) provides that the same eight factor s apply.  So the ques-\ntion is this: In determining whether to revoke supervised release, may \na district court account for these omitted factors\u2014and specifically \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)?  Esteras says no; the Government says yes.  Pp. 4\u20138. \n  (b) The Court agrees with Esteras.  District courts cannot consider \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.  That conclusion fol-lows from the well-established ca non of statutory interpretation\u2014\u201c ex-\npressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d\u2014which means that expressing one item of an associated group excludes  another item not mentioned.  See \nChevron U. S. A. Inc.  v. Echazabal , 536 U. S. 73, 80.  While Congress \nelsewhere set forth ten factors that must generally inform a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions, it provided in \u00a73583(e)\u2014the provision governing the revocation of supervised release\u2014that courts must con-\nsider only eight of those ten factors.   The natural implication is that \nCongress did not intend courts to co nsider the other two factors, in-\ncluding \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). \n The statutory structure confirms this negative inference.  Neighbor-\ning provisions governing the impositi on and revocation of other kinds \nof sentences instruct courts to consider all the \u00a73553(a) factors.  But \nfor supervised release\u2014and superv ised release only\u2014Congress omit-\nted \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  This is a distinction with a difference.  And Con-\ngress\u2019s decision to exclude retribution from the calculus also comports \nwith supervised release\u2019s role in the criminal justic e scheme.  Super-\nvised release \u201cis not a punishment in lieu of incarceration.\u201d  United \nStates v. Granderson , 511 U. S. 39, 50.  Rather , it \u201cfulfills rehabilita-\ntive ends\u201d and \u201cprovides individuals with postconfinement assistance.\u201d  \nUnited States  v. Johnson , 529 U. S. 53, 59\u201360.  So when a defendant \nviolates a condition of supervised release, courts must consider the for-\nward-looking  sentencing ends, but may not consider the backward-\nlooking  purpose of retribution. \n  The Court has twice interpreted th e omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from \nthe provision governing th e imposition of supervised release to mean \nthat district courts may not consider that factor.  See Tapia  v. United \nStates, 564 U. S. 319; Concepcion  v. United States, 597 U. S. 481.  Alt-\nhough Tapia and Concepcion  both deal with the imposition of super-\nvised release under \u00a73583(c), the same reasoning applies to revocation under \u00a73583(e): the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) means that courts may not consider it.  Pp. 8\u201310. \n  (c) The Government\u2019s counterarguments are unpersuasive.  The \nGovernment reads the exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from \u00a73583(e) to \n  \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nSyllabus \nmean that district courts must  consider enumerated factors and need \nnot (but may) consider unenumerated ones.  Given sentencing judges\u2019 \ndiscretion, the Government argues, Congress would have been more \nexplicit had it intended to forecl ose the consideration of retributive \naims when revoking supervised release. But what Congress said is\nclear: The itemized list in \u00a73583(e)  is exhaustive and supplies the en-\ntire universe of factors courts ma y consider.  And the Government\u2019s \nreading trivializes the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A): As the Governmentrecognizes, a court may \u201cconsider\u201d an enumerated factor but give it no \nweight.  Yet there is negligible di fference between saying that a court \nmust consider a given factor (but may give it no weight) and saying \nthat a court may consider a given factor (i f the court so chooses). \nNext, the Government argues that Esteras\u2019s reading is unworkable\nbecause considering other enumerat ed factors\u2014such as \u201cthe nature\nand circumstances of the offense\u201d under \u00a73553(a)(1)\u2014will necessarily \nimply consideration of the retributive principles captured by\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  While the Government asks how a court may consider \nthe nature and circumstances of th e offense without also considering \nthe retributive principles captured by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), the answer is \nstraightforward.  Courts may consider the offense\u2019s nature and circum -\nstances to inform the considerations set forth in \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C),and (D)\u2014deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.  But courts \ncannot consider them as relevant to \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retributive focus. \nFinally, the Government interprets \u00a73583(g), which mandates  revo-\ncation in certain circumstances, as subject to the full list of \u00a73553(a) factors.  And it would be anomalou s, the Government says, if courts \ncould consider retribution in mandatory revocations under \u00a73583(g) \nbut not in discretionary  revocations under \u00a73583(e)(3). The correct \nreading of \u00a73583(g) does not affect the Court\u2019s analysis.  That \u00a73583(e) might operate differently from \u00a735 83(g) is no reason to disregard \n\u00a73583(e)\u2019s plain meaning.  Pp. 11\u201316. \n(d) When appellate courts review a claim that the district court \nhas impermissibly relied on \u00a73553(a )(2)(A), much will turn on whether \nthe defendant has properly objected to the district court\u2019s impermissi -\nble reliance on \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). If no t, the defendant\u2019s appeal will be \ngoverned by plain-error review.  But if a court considers retribution for \nthe original offense over the defend ant\u2019s objection, and the error was \nnot harmless, then the court of a ppeals should vacate the order and \nremand for the court to apply the correct standard.  None of this turns the Court\u2019s reading of \u00a73583(e) in to a \u201csubstance-free reverse magic-\nwords requirement,\u201d as the Governme nt suggests.  Brief for United \nStates 37.  The Government confla tes the proper interpretation of \n\u00a73583(e) with an appellate court\u2019s ability to enforce that interpreta-\ntion.

But a court may do so\nonly \u201cafter considering\u201d an enumerated list of sentencing \nfactors: those \u201cset forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B),\n(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  \u00a73583(e).Conspicuously missing from this list is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A),\nwhich directs a district court to consider \u201cthe need for the \nsentence imposed\u201d \u201cto reflect th e seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punish -\nment for the offense.\u201d The Sixth Circuit held that a district court may consider that factor nonetheless. \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 2 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nWe disagree.  Congress\u2019s decision to enumerate most of \nthe sentencing factors while omitting \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) raises \na strong inference that courts  may not consider that factor \nwhen deciding whether to revo ke a term of supervised re -\nlease. This inference is consistent with both the statutory structure and the role that supervised release plays in the\nsentencing process. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments\nof the Sixth Circuit and remand for further proceedings. \nI \nIn 2018, Edgardo Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to\ndistribute heroin. Varying downward from the 15-to-21-month sentencing range, the District Court sentenced him \nto 12 months in prison, to be followed by a 6-year term of \nsupervised release.\nWhen Esteras completed his term of imprisonment, his \nperiod of supervised release began. Three years in, the pro -\nbation office notified the District Court that Esteras had \nbeen arrested. According to the mother of his children,\nEsteras had threatened to kill her and had fired three \nrounds into her vehicle. Este ras was charged in municipal \ncourt with domestic violence , aggravated menacing, and \ncriminal damaging, although the charges were ultimatelydismissed at the request of the victim. \nThe District Court held a revo cation hearing, at which it \nfound that Esteras had violated the conditions of his super-\nvised release. The District Court remarked that Esteras \nwas \u201cno stranger to law violations and no stranger to fed-\neral court\u201d and that his previous drug sentences had been \n\u201crather lenient.\u201d App. 96a. The District Court revoked his \nsupervised release and ordered 24 months of reimprison-\nment, an upward variation from  the advisory 6-to-12-month \nrange, with three more years of supervised release to follow. \nAt this point, Esteras\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the\nDistrict Court had impermissibly considered \u201cthe factor in \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  3 Cite as: 606 U.

Lewis , 498 F. 3d 393, 399\u2013400 (2007).\nThe District Court in turn acknowledged that part of its de -\ncision \u201ccertainly [was] the need for the sentence imposed, to\npromote respect for the law.\u201d  App. 105a.  In a subsequent written order, the District Court explained that it had \u201ccon -\nsidered the factors and conditio ns for sentencing listed in\n18 U. S.

See 88 F. 4th \n1163 (2023).

In determining the appropri-\nate sentence, the court must consider certain factors set \nforth in \u00a73553(a). Some are obvious: The court must con-sider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u201cthe \nhistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cthe \nkinds of sentences available.\u201d  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1), (3).

What sentence will protect the public?And what sentence is most likely to help the defendant re-\nhabilitate for transition back into society? \nA judge who imposes a term of imprisonment may\u2014and \nsometimes must\u2014impose a postimprisonment term of su-\npervised release.  \u00a73583(a).  \u201cSupervised release is \u2018a formof postconfinement monitoring \u2019 that permits a defendant a\nkind of conditional liberty by allowing him to serve part of his sentence outside of prison,\u201d subject to conditions on his behavior.

Only two of the \u00a73553(a) factors are \nabsent from this list. The first is \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), which re-quires the court to consider the need for the sentence im-\nposed to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the \noffense,\u201d i.e., the retributive purposes of sentencing.  The \nsecond is \u00a73553(a)(3), which re quires the court to consider \n\u201cthe kinds of sentences available.\u201d  When a court decides whether to revoke  a defendant\u2019s supervised release, the very \nsame subset of \u00a73553(a) factors\u2014that is, all but two\u2014ap -\nplies. \u00a73583(e)(3).\n3 \nThe reason for excluding \u00a73553(a)(3) from the list is self-\nevident: When a district court decides whether to revoke a \nterm of supervised release, there is no need to consider \u201cthe\nkinds of sentences available,\u201d because supervised release is\nthe only matter at issue.4  The exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3The same list of factors also applies when a district court modifies the \nterms of supervised release, such as by terminating supervised release \nearly, by extending the term of superv ised release, or by altering the con-\nditions of supervised release.  \u00a7\u00a73583(e)(1)\u2013(2), (4). \n4The dissent offers a different view of  \u00a73553(a)(3).  In its view, the ter-\nmination, extension, modification, an d revocation of supervised release \nare all different \u201ckinds of \u201d sentences. Post, at 7\u20138 (opinion of A LITO, J.). \nThe Government never makes this ar gument\u2014and for good reason.  To \nbegin, it is textually implausible.  As the statute articulates, there are \nthree \u201ckinds of sentences available\u201d fo r an individual \u201cfound guilty of an \noffense\u201d: \u201ca term of probation,\u201d \u201ca fi ne,\u201d and \u201ca term of imprisonment.\u201d \n\u00a7\u00a73551(b)(1)\u2013(3); \u00a73553(a)(3).  In fact, a term of supervised release is not itself a \u201csentence\u201d at all; it is a component of a defendant\u2019s prison sen-\ntence.  See \u00a73583(a) (\u201cThe court, in imposing a sentence to a term of im -\nprisonment  . . . , may include as a part of the sentence  a requirement that \nthe defendant be placed on a term of  supervised release after imprison-\nment\u201d (emphasis added)).  Thus, to th e extent the dissent thinks that the \ntermination, extension, modification, and revocation of supervised re-\nlease are different \u201ckinds of sentences available\u201d to the court, it is mis-taken.  \u00a73553(a)(3). \nThe dissent\u2019s interpretation is perp lexing for another reason too: It \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 7 Cite as: 606 U.

Esteras argues\nthat district courts cannot  consider the retributive purpose \narticulated in \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised re-\nlease. The Government insists that courts can consider it, \nalthough they are not required to do so. \nB \nTo see what is at stake, k eep in mind that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) \ndoes not speak of retribution generally\u2014it references theneed for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the of-\nfense \u201d and to \u201cprovide just punishment for the offense .\u201d \n(Emphasis added.) In the context of a revocation hearing,\nthe \u201coffense\u201d is the underlying crime of conviction, not the \nviolation of the supervised-release conditions.  The opening \nprovision of Title 18\u2019s sentencing chapter clearly uses \u201cof-\nfense\u201d to refer to a criminal conviction.  See \u00a73551(a) (stat-ing that the sentencing provisions apply to \u201ca defendant \nwho has been found guilty of an offense described in any \nFederal statute\u201d). Yet condu ct that constitutes a violation \nof supervised release \u201cneed not be criminal.\u201d Johnson , 529 \nU. S., at 700; see, e.g., \u00a73583(g)(3) (mandating revocation\nwhen a defendant fails to comp ly with drug testing imposed \nas a condition of release).  Furthermore, neighboring provi-sions in \u00a73583 consistently use the word \u201coffense\u201d to refer \nto the defendant\u2019s original cri me of conviction, while using \nthe word \u201cviolation\u201d to refer to  the conduct that triggers rev -\nocation. Compare \u00a73583(e)(3) (referencing the \u201coffense that \nresulted in the term of supervised release\u201d); \u00a73583(h) (\u201cthe offense that resulted in the original term of supervised re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ntreats Congress\u2019s omission of \u00a73553(a)(3) from the set of factors that gov-\nern revocation proceedings as nothing more than an inexplicable drafting \nerror; under its view, not only may district courts consider \u00a73553(a)(3), \nthey must do so.

See Brief \nfor United States 11, 34; \u00a73583(e) (requiring courts to consider \u00a73553(a)(4) and \u00a73553(a)(5)).

The natural implication is that Congress\ndid not intend for courts to consider the other two factors, \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) and \u00a73553(a)(3).  Indeed, the expressio unius\ncanon has particular force here because the \u00a73553(a) sen-\ntencing factors constitute an \u201ce stablished series,\u201d such that \nany \u201comission\u201d from that series necessarily \u201cbespeaks anegative implication.\u201d Chevron U. S. A. Inc. , 536 U. S., at \n81. And the fact that Congress included almost the entire\nlist makes the exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) and \u00a73553(a)(3) all the more glaring.\nThe statutory structure confirms this negative inference. \nNeighboring provisions that govern the imposition and rev-\nocation of sentences other than supervised release instruct the court to consider all the factors in \u00a73553(a).  For in-\nstance, when imposing a term of probation, the court \u201cshall\nconsider the factors set forth in \u00a73553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable.\u201d  \u00a73562(a).

So for supervised release\u2014and for\nsupervised release only\u2014Congress omitted \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).\nThis, we think, is a distinction with a difference.

Fines, probation, and im-\nprisonment are a court\u2019s primary tools for ensuring that a criminal defendant receives just deserts for the original of-\nfense. Supervised release, by contrast, \u201cis not a punish-\nment in lieu of incarceration.\u201d United States  v.

So when a defendant violates the conditions of his \nsupervised release, it makes sense that a court must con-\nsider the forward-looking ends of sentencing (deterrence,\nincapacitation, and rehabilitation), but may not consider the backward-looking purpose of retribution.\nFinally, our conclusion is consistent with this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. We have twice interpreted the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the provision governing the imposition\nof supervised release (\u00a73583(c)) to mean that district courts\nmay not consider that factor when imposing supervised re -\nlease.

Alt-hough Tapia and Concepcion both deal with the imposition \nof supervised release under \u00a73583(c), the same reasoning \napplies to the revocation of supervised release under\n\u00a73583(e): The omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list of fac-\ntors means that courts may not consider it. \nText, structure, and precedent all point in the same di-\nrection: Congress\u2019s decision to exclude \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from\u00a73583(e)\u2019s list of sentencing factors means that district \ncourts cannot consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when deciding\nwhether to revoke supervised release. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7The dissent suggests that when we said that \u201c \u2018a court may not take \naccount of retribution,\u2019 \u201d we may have actually meant that \u201ca judge, as a \nmatter of discretion, may choose not to take retribution into account.\u201d \nPost, at 14.

S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nWe are unpersuaded by the Government\u2019s and the dis-\nsent\u2019s counterarguments. Fi rst, the Government and the \ndissent read the exclusion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) as supporting a \ndifferent inference\u2014namely,  that a district court must con-\nsider the enumerated factors but need not  consider the un-\nenumerated ones, such as \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  Because \u201csen-\ntencing judges \u2018enjo[y] discretion in the sort of information they may consider,\u2019 \u201d the Government argues, Congress \nwould have used more explicit  language had it wanted to\nforeclose courts from consider ing retribution when revoking\nsupervised release. Concepcion , 597 U. S., at 491 (quoting \nDean  v. United States , 581 U. S. 62, 66 (2017); alteration in \noriginal). For example, Congress could have said that courts may revoke supervised release \u201cafter considering only\u201d the enumerated factors. Brief for United States 23; \nsee also post, at 4\u20136 (A\nLITO, J., dissenting).\nWhen interpretive disputes arise, it is easy to imagine \nhow Congress could have drafted the statute to avoid them.But Congress cannot anticipate (much less account for)\nevery future statutory skirmi sh\u2014and even if it could, \ncourts have no authority to hold Congress to a \u201cperfect as \nwe see it\u201d standard of drafting.  On the contrary, we have\n\u201croutinely construed statutes to have a particular meaning\u201d \neven when \u201cCongress could have expressed itself more\nclearly.\u201d Luna Torres  v. Lynch, 578 U. S. 452, 472 (2016).\nWhat Congress said here gets its point across just fine: The \nitemized list in \u00a73583(e) is exhaustive.  As we explained, the\nprovision allows district courts to consider all but two of the \n\u00a73553(a) factors, and because one is inapplicable in this con -\ntext (\u00a73553(a)(3)), \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is the only consequentialomission.  So it makes sense to read \u00a73583(e) as supplyingthe universe of factors that the district court can consider. \nAnd while the Government is right that district courts gen-\nerally enjoy discretion over sentencing, see Brief for United\nStates 21\u201322, Congress chose to limit that discretion here. \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nIt makes much less sense to read \u00a73583(e) as the Govern-\nment does\u2014that is, as listing only the factors that a court must consider, while leaving room for the court to consider\nan additional factor if it so ch ooses.  This reading of \u00a73583(e)\ntrivializes the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  After all, on the Government\u2019s view, a court may \u201cconsider\u201d an enumerated \nfactor but give it no weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 61.  The differ-\nence between saying that a court must consider a given fac-\ntor (but may give it no weig ht) and saying that a court may\nconsider a given factor (if the court chooses) is negligible. \nWhy would Congress have bothered to exclude \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list?\nThe dissent has no response to this point, so it instead \nanalogizes to different\u2014and inapposite\u2014contexts. For ex-ample, the dissent says, suppose that a law clerk is directed\nto complete a certain number of bench memos before a\ndeadline; surely that instruction would not carry the infer-\nence that the law clerk may no t complete more work too. \nPost, at 5. But the important difference between that con-\ntext and this one is that sentencing considerations, unlike bench memos, can be zero sum: Adding a new consideration \nto the mix reduces the role that the enumerated considera-\ntions play. In fact, the new consideration might lead to a different result altogether.\nA play on the dissent\u2019s own analogy reveals its weak-\nnesses. Imagine that a judge tells her hypothetical law \nclerk to prepare a bench memo with a recommendation \nformed \u201cafter considering\u201d statutory text, context, and structure, as well as any relevant precedent.  Having looked\nat these sources, the law clerk is inclined to recommend \nthat the judge reverse the court below.  But the law clerk \ndecides to look elsewhere\u2014say, to social science studies\u2014\nand she uses these sources to inform her recommendation. In the end, she submits a memo recommending that the \njudge vote to affirm the lower court\u2019s decision.

Needless to say, we disagree. \nMore to the point, the di ssent never explains why Con-\ngress omitted \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list of considerations applicable to a revocation proceeding. After all, in the dis-\nsent\u2019s view, district courts will almost inevitably consider \nthat factor. See post, at 3\u20134, 8\u201311, 12\u201313, n. 7.  So why did\nCongress exclude it? In the dissent\u2019s view, the omission is \njust hortatory: \u201cCongress may have sought to encourage \nsentencing courts to give gr eater weight to the remaining\npurposes of sentencing.\u201d Post, at 12\u201313, n. 7.\n8  But omitting\nconsideration of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) altogether would be an odd way of accomplishing that very limited goal.  And one need not \u201clive in a world of airy abstractions,\u201d post, at 1, to rec-\nognize that Congress\u2019s drafting  decisions have significance. \nNext, the Government and the dissent argue that\nEsteras\u2019s reading of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is unworkable, because consideration of the other e numerated factors will neces-\nsarily imply consideration of the retributive principles cap-tured by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). The Government relies primarilyon \u00a73553(a)(1), which references \u201cthe nature and circum -\nstances of the offense.\u201d  How, the Government asks, is a court to consider the nature and circumstances of the of-fense without also considering the \u201cneed for the sentence\nimposed\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriou sness of the offense, to pro-\nmote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment forthe offense\u201d ?  \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).\nThe answer is straightforward.  A court may consider the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8Alternatively, the dissent posits that Congress may have understood\neach of the three \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) factors to \u201capply in some, though not all, \nhearings regarding the alterati on of supervised release.\u201d  Post, at 12\u201313, \nn. 7. Which hearings make the cut?  Frankly, we are not sure.  Some \nparts of the dissent\u2019s lengthy footnote suggest all; others suggest none; and still others suggest that it \u201cdepends on context.\u201d  Ibid.   In our view, \nhowever, \u201c[t]he Sentencing Reform Act does not place district judges in\nsuch a predicament.\u201d  Post, at 1\u20132. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n 14 ESTERAS v.

For \ninstance, if the defendant\u2019s original offense was particularlyviolent, that fact might inform the court\u2019s judgment as to\nwhether revocation is necessary \u201cto protect the public fromfurther crimes of the defendant.\u201d  \u00a73553(a)(2)(C).  But the \ncourt could not revoke based on  the view that, given the vi -\nolent nature of the underlying offense, the defendant de-\nserves additional punishment.\n9 \nThe dissent, for its part, argues that we are simply wrong \nto understand \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) as synonymous with retribu-\ntion. Post, at 8\u201311. Under the dissent\u2019s view, \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) serves an extensive (if amorphous) role: The phrase \u201c \u2018to promote respect for the law\u2019 \u201d encompasses \u201cthe\nwhole point of deterrence,\u201d while the reference to the \u201c \u2018seri-\nousness of the offense\u2019 \u201d invokes the \u201cheightened need for\ndeterrence and incapacitation.\u201d Post, at 8\u20139. But this ap-\nproach renders \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) largely duplicative of the clear references to deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabili-\ntation that follow in \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C), and (D). Recall, too, that there are four traditional purposes of sentencing. \nGiven that \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C), and(D) set forth three of \nthese purposes, it is no wond er that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) provides \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9The dissent suggests that this will be an impossible task for district \ncourts. See post, at 1 (Courts must \u201cengage in  mind-bending exercises\u201d); \npost, at 10 (They must \u201cprobe their ment al processes to ensure that no \nthoughts of retribution entered in\u201d); post, at 11 (We require a \u201csoul-\nsearching obligation\u201d). Not so.  We ro utinely require judges and juries to \nattend to some considerations while ignoring others.  See, e.g., Samia v. \nUnited States , 599 U.

Not to mention that  the provision speaks in re-\ntributive terms: the \u201cseriousness of the offense,\u201d the need \n\u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d and, in particular, the need\u201cto provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). In any event, we say nothing about the\nmeaning of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) today that we have not already\nsaid before.  See Tapia , 564 U. S., at 326 (\u201cretribution\u201d is\n\u201cthe first purpose listed in \u00a73553(a)(2)\u201d); Concepcion , 597 \nU. S., at 494. \nFinally, the Government suggests that \u00a73583(g), which \nmandates  revocation in certain circumstances, undermines \nEsteras\u2019s interpretation of the statute.  Section 3583(g) does\nnot specify which factors apply when a court determines the \nlength of the defendant\u2019s postrevocation term of imprison-ment.\n10  So, the Government reasons, reimprisonment un-\nder \u00a73583(g) must be subject to the general rule for prison \nsentences articulated in \u00a73582(a), and that provision di-\nrects courts to the full list of \u00a73553(a) factors.  It would be \nanomalous, the Government says, if a district court could \nconsider retribution as part of a mandatory  revocation un-\nder \u00a73583(g) but not as part of a discretionary  revocation \nunder \u00a73583(e)(3).  Esteras, for his part, argues for con-sistency in the other direction: He argues that \u00a73583(e)\u2019s\nabbreviated list governs in both contexts.\nWe need not resolve the dispute because it does not affect\nour analysis. To begin, the Government\u2019s reading of\u00a73583(e) does not solve the problem that the Government\nhas identified. As the Government sees it, if revocation is \ndiscretionary and thus gove rned by \u00a73583(e), the court may\nconsider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), but if revocation is mandatory and thus governed by \u00a73583(g), the court must consider \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n10Section 3583(g) states that, if the defendant violates certain condi-\ntions of supervised release, \u201cthe court shall revoke the term of supervised \nrelease and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment not \nto exceed the maximum term of impr isonment authorized under subsec-\ntion (e)(3).\u201d (Emphasis added.) \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n 16 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). So while the Government says that it would \nbe \u201chighly anomalous to have different regimes for deter-\nmining the length of prison terms under Sections 3583(e)(3) and 3583(g),\u201d that anomaly persists under the Govern -\nment\u2019s own reading of the statut e.  Brief for United States \n26. In any event, that \u00a73583(e) might operate differently \nfrom \u00a73583(g) is not reason to disregard \u00a73583(e)\u2019s plain\nmeaning. \nIV \nAt oral argument, the Government expressed concern\nthat it would be difficult for appellate courts to determine whether a district court has  impermissibly relied on \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 49\u201350.  So we conclude with a few observations about appellate review.\nMuch will turn on whether the defendant objects.  If the \ndefendant does not make the district court aware that it may be impermissibly relying on \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), then the \ndefendant\u2019s appeal will be gove rned by plain-error review.\nSee Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). In that event, the district court\u2019s order revoking supervis ed release and requiring re-\nimprisonment will be affirmed unless it is \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 \u201d or \u201c\u2018ob-\nvious\u2019 \u201d that the district court actually relied on \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2014because it did so either expressly or by un -\nmistakable implication. United States  v. Olano , 507 U. S. \n725, 734 (1993).\nIf the defendant does object to the district court\u2019s reliance\non \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), we anticipate that the district court will recognize its potential error and  clarify its revocation deci-\nsion to make clear that it is not taking account of\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). For example, the district court could with-\ndraw any impermissible justific ation or explain that a stray \nreference to a \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) factor was intended to bear on another \u00a73553(a) factor or merely prefatory. If the court \nnonetheless considers the need to exact retribution for the \ndefendant\u2019s original criminal offense, and if the error was \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 17 Cite as: 606 U.

The Government conflates the proper interpretation of\n\u00a73583(e) with an appellate court\u2019s ability to enforce that in-\nterpretation.  The \u201crequiremen t\u201d here is very much sub-\nstantive: District courts may not consider the retributivepurpose of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) before revoking supervised re-lease.

I agree that \ndistrict courts may not rely on the retributive sentencing\nfactor set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) to revoke su-\npervised release. In my view , however, district courts re-\nvoking a term of supervised re lease should not consider ret-\nribution for any purpose. \nThe question in these cases is whether, despite Con-\ngress\u2019s omission in the supervised-release statute of any \nreference to retribution, cou rts may consider retribution \nwhen they decide whether to revoke a term of supervised \nrelease. The answer is no. In specifying the factors courts\nshould consider before revoki ng a term of supervised re-\nlease, Congress cross-referenced eight out of the ten famil-iar \u00a73553(a) factors, including three of the four purposes of sentencing: deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\n\u201cConspicuously missing\u201d from the supervised-release stat -\nute, however, \u201cis \u00a73553(a)(2)(A),\u201d which describes the re -\n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  2 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR , J. \ntributive purpose of punishment. Ante,  at 1. The straight -\nforward inference, as we have said twice before, is that \n\u201cCongress has expressly preclu ded district courts from con-\nsidering the need for retribution\u201d in supervised release pro-\nceedings. Concepcion  v. United States , 597 U. S. 481, 494 \n(2022); see also Tapia  v. United States , 564 U. S. 319, 326 \n(2011). That resolves this case. \nThe majority approaches the question differently.  \u201cIn the \ncontext of a revocation hearing,\u201d it reasons, the word \u201c \u2018of-\nfense\u2019 \u201d in \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) refers to \u201cthe underlying crime of \nconviction, not the violation of  the supervised-release con -\nditions.\u201d Ante,  at 7. So (the majority continues) by exclud -\ning \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the supervised-release statute, Congress precluded courts from accounting \u201cfor the need to \nexact retribution for the defendant\u2019s underlying crime.\u201d Ante,  at 8. \nThe problem with that framin g is that it relies on an in-\nterpretive question with no clear answer. The term \u201cof-\nfense\u201d in \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) has no meaning \u201c[i]n the context of a revocation hearing,\u201d because the supervised-release stat-ute contains no reference to \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) or its directive\nto \u201cprovide just punishme nt for the offense.\u201d  Cf. ante,  at 7. \nAt most, then, the majority could ask what Congress would have meant by \u201coffense\u201d if it had included a reference to \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) in this statute.  Yet such speculation is un-\nnecessary to resolve this case .  Congress studiously omitted\nall reference to retribution from the supervised-release \nstatute, so retribution should play no role in revocation \nhearings.\nBecause the majority frames the question as one about \nretribution for the original offense, it never decides whether \nthe supervised-release statute precludes courts from exact-\ning retribution for the defendant \u2019s supervised-release viola -\ntion. Yet the answer to that question is straightforward.As the Court holds today, the supervised-release statute does not permit consideration of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).

As the majority recognizes, moreo-\nver, the retributive interest in punishment is ill suited to\nsupervised-release proceedings.  Supervised release \u201c \u2018ful-\nfills rehabilitative ends\u2019  and \u2018provides individuals with\npostconfinement assistance.\u2019 \u201d  Ante , at 10 (quoting United \nStates v. Johnson , 529 U. S. 53, 59\u201360 (2000)); see also \nS. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 124 (1983) (Senate Report noting \nthat \u201cthe primary goal\u201d of superv ised release \u201cis to ease the \ndefendant\u2019s transition into the community . . . or to providerehabilitation\u201d). Thus, \u201cwhen a defendant violates the con -\nditions of his supervised release, it makes sense that a court \nmust consider the forward-looking  ends of sentencing (de-\nterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation), but may not consider the backward-looking  purpose of retribution.\u201d \nAnte , at 10. \nIn sum, when a court considers whether a supervised-\nrelease violation warrants revocation and reimprisonment (its primary task during revoca tion hearings), it must look \nonly to the forward-looking ends mentioned in the statute. \nAs to either a supervised-release violation or the underlying \noffense, the backward-looking end of retribution is out of\nbounds. Although I would have made this point explicit,\nnothing in the Court\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with it.

As sentencing judges know, revocation of supervised\nrelease occurs in response to new\u2014often criminal\u2014con-duct. It is entirely conceivable, and perhaps even likely, \nthat when Congress removed from the list of permissible\nrevocation considerations \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed for the sen -\ntence imposed\u201d to exact retributio n, it sought to prevent the\npromotion of retribution with respect to whatever new of-fense triggered the call for revocati on of supervised release.\nAt the very least, that possi bility counsels against defini-\ntively asserting that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s conspicuous omissiononly speaks to whether a dis trict court can \u201caccount for the\nneed to exact retribution for the defendant\u2019s underlying \ncrime .\u201d Ante , at 8 (emphasis added). \nIn any event, because \u00a73553(a) requires district courts to\nimpose sentences that are \u201csufficient, but not greater than\nnecessary\u201d to promote certain purposes of punishment, the \nkind of hairsplitting that the majority\u2019s opinion invites isentirely impractical. Sentences either \u201creflect,\u201d \u201cafford,\u201d or \n\u201cprovide\u201d for the listed purposes of punishment (retribu-\ntion, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation) or they\ndon\u2019t. \u00a73553(a)(2). It is hard to fathom that Congress \nmeant for retribution to be both operable and inoperable asit relates to the imposition of  a single revocation sanction, \nand it is even harder to imagine how a sentencing court caneffectively achieve that binary objective.\nPart II\u2013B of the majority\u2019s opinion is both unnecessary to\nthe outcome of this litigation and inscrutable in light of how revocation sentences are actually determined and imposed. \nTherefore, I cannot join that Part of the opinion. \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  _________________ \n_________________ 1 Cite as: 606 U.

Today\u2019s decision is likely to earn the rank of Exhibit \nA in the trial bench\u2019s catalog of appellate otherworldliness.\nThe Court interprets the Sent encing Reform Act to mean \nthat a federal district-court judge, when consideringwhether to impose or alter a term of supervised release, \nmust engage in mind-bending exercises.

Neither the statutory text, the in-\nterpretive canon on which th e Court relies, nor the struc-\nture of the Act supports the Court\u2019s interpretation. \nI \nA \nIn order to understand these cases and the points on \nwhich the majority and I disagree, some background infor-\nmation about federal sentencing is required. When a de-fendant is \u201cfound guilty of an offense,\u201d he may be sentenced \nto \u201ca term of probation,\u201d \u201ca fine,\u201d or \u201ca term of imprison-\nment.\u201d \u00a73551(b). And in crafting a sentence, the court isrequired to consider the 10 factors that are set out in\n\u00a73553(a). (For convenience, I will call these the sentencing \nfactors.)\nIf a sentencing court imposes a term of imprisonment, the \ncourt generally has discretion to include \u201cas a part of the sentence\u201d a term of supervised release. \u00a73583(a).\n1  \u201cSuper -\nvised release is \u2018a form of po stconfinement monitoring\u2019 that\npermits a defendant a kind of conditional liberty by allow-\ning him to serve part of his sentence outside of prison.\u201d \nMont  v. United States, 587 U. S. 514, 523 (2019) (quoting \nJohnson  v. United States, 529 U. S. 694, 697 (2000)).  In de-\nciding whether to impose and in devising a term of super -\nvised release, a judge is required to consider 8 of the 10 sen-\ntencing factors noted above, specifically, \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1),\n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\n(For convenience, I will call these the supervised-release\nfactors.)\nDuring a term of supervised release, a defendant must\ncomply with certain standard conditions, such as reportingto a probation officer, as well as any special conditions that \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1In some cases, the imposition of supervised release is mandatory.\nSee, e.g., 18 U.

Courts, Overview of Probation \nand Supervised Release Conditions 8 (2024).  If a defendant fails to comply with these conditions, revocation of super-\nvised release is sometimes mandatory, see, e.g., \u00a73583(g),\nbut in most cases, the court has discretion to choose the ap-propriate response.  For example, it may \u201cextend\u201d super-\nvised release \u201cif less than the maximum authorized term was previously imposed\u201d; \u201cmodify, reduce, or enlarge the \nconditions of supervised release\u201d; or, more seriously, \u201cre-\nvoke\u201d supervised release and \u201crequire the defendant to \nserve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in suchterm of supervised release.\u201d \u00a7\u00a73583(e)(2), (3).  In deciding \nwhether to alter a term of supe rvised release, the court is\nrequired to consider the same eight factors that had to betaken into account in imposing  the term of supervised re-\nlease in the first place.\nIn these cases, the lead petitioner, Edgardo Esteras, vio -\nlated a term of his supervised release by assaulting the\nmother of his children and shooting at her vehicle. The sen-\ntencing judge revoked supervised release and, in doing so, \nreferred to Esteras\u2019s criminal history and the need to \u201cen-courage [him] to be respectful of the law.\u201d  App. 96a. Citing\nthese remarks, Esteras contends that the judge based his \ndecision on an impermissible factor, namely, a desire to\n\u201cpromote respect for the law.\u201d  This factor, which appears\nin \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), is one of the two sentencing factors omit-ted from the list of supervised-release factors.  Esteras ar -\ngues, and the Court now agrees, that the omission of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list of supervised-release factors means that it cannot be considered.  In other words, the \njudge in Esteras\u2019s case was obligated to put out of his mind\nany desire \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  Before today,\none might have thought that every aspect of a federal \njudge\u2019s work should aim to \u201cp romote respect for the law.\u201d \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nALITO, J., dissenting \nApparently, that is no longer true. \nB \nThe question in these cases is what to make of the omis-\nsion of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) from the list of supervised-release fac-\ntors. The Court infers that consideration of this factor is \nforbidden, and, in so doing, relies almost entirely on a canon\nof interpretation that bears the Latin name expressio unius \nest exclusio alterius . In English, that means \u201c[t]he expres-\nsion of one thing implies the exclusion of others.\u201d  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 107 (2012) (Scalia & Garner).  To modify a classic ex-\nample slightly, suppose a sign at the entrance of a park \nsaid: \u201cNo gasoline- or electric-powered vehicles allowed.\u201dUnder the expressio unius  canon, it would be fair to infer \nthat standard bikes are permitted.  See H. Hart, Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals, 71 Harv. L. Rev.\n593, 607 (1958).\nAlthough this canon has its place, Reading Law empha-\nsizes that it \u201cmust be applied with great caution, since its\napplication depends so much on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner 107. Our cases have made the same point and have often\nrejected use of the canon because of the context in which the expression appeared. See, e.g., NLRB  v. SW General, Inc. , \n580 U. S. 288, 302 (2017) (\u201cThe expressio unius canon ap -\nplies only when circumstances support[ ] a sensible infer-\nence that the term left out must have been meant to be ex-\ncluded\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Barnhart  v. \nPeabody Coal Co. , 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003) (\u201c[T]he canon \nexpressio unius est exclusio alterius  does not apply to every\nstatutory listing or grouping\u201d).  Reading Law also containsthis important warning: \u201cEve n when an all-inclusive sense \nseems apparent, one must still identify the scope of the in -\nclusiveness  (thereby limiting [the] implied exclusion).\u201d\nScalia & Garner 108 (emphasis added). \nIn these cases, I agree with the Court that the omission \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 5 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nALITO, J., dissenting \nof two of the sentencing factors from the list of supervised- \nrelease factors gives rise to a negative inference, but I disa -\ngree with the Court about the nature of that inference.  The \nmost likely\u2014and in my view, the appropriate\u2014inference is \nsimply that \u00a73583(e), the prov ision listing the supervised-\nrelease factors, sets out an exclusive list of mandatory  fac-\ntors. That is \u201cthe scope of the inclusiveness.\u201d  The Court, \nhowever, goes further and infers not just that there are noother mandatory  factors but that there are no other permis -\nsible  factors.  That aggressive application of the expressio \nunius canon goes too far.  While the inference produced by \nthat canon is always dependent on context, the enumera-tion of things that must be done generally does not suggest \nthat no other things may be done.\nConsider this example. Suppose I tell my law clerks on a \nMonday that by the end of the week they must complete the \nbench memos in 6 of the 12 cases scheduled for argument \nduring the next sitting. That statement would strongly im-\nply that completion of other bench memos by the end of the\nweek is not mandatory.  But the statement would not sug-gest that finishing other bench memos is forbidden.  Many \nother similar examples could be provided. \nTo salvage its far-reaching inference, the Court offers its \nown variation on the law-clerk hypothetical.  In the Court\u2019s \nhypothetical, a judge tells a clerk \u201cto prepare a bench memowith a recommendation formed \u2018after considering\u2019 statutory \ntext, context, and structure, as well as any relevant prece-\ndent.\u201d Ante , at 12. As the Court sees it, if the law clerk also \nreviews secondary sources \u201cto inform her recommendation,\u201d the law clerk did not \u201cobe[y] her boss\u2019s instructions.\u201d  Ante , \nat 12\u201313 . \nBut nothing about the Court\u2019s hypothetical suggests the\nlaw clerk must exclusively consider those four factors.\nWould the clerk necessarily infer from the judge\u2019s instruc -\ntion that nothing else could be considered?  I doubt it.  And if the clerk knows that the judge thinks that other factors, \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 6 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nALITO, J., dissenting \nsuch as statutory purpose or legislative history, are rele-\nvant considerations, the inference is unlikely.\nFor this reason, the Court\u2019s use of the expressio unius\ncanon exceeds its customary and  proper use, and the Court \nprovides no good reason for its aggressive use of that inter-\npretive tool. The Court finds it significant that Congress \nincluded in the list of supervised-release factors \u201calmost the entire list\u201d of sentencing factors but left out \u00a73553(a)(2)(A). Ante , at 9. According to the Court, this makes \u201call the more\nglaring\u201d Congress\u2019s intention that sentencing courts should not consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when modifying a term of su-\npervised release. Ibid. \nThis is illogical.  When a provision sets out a rule and lists\nitems to which the rule applies, the length of the list may \nbolster the strength of the inference that the list is exhaus -\ntive, but it does not alter the scope of the rule.  Suppose I\ntell friends who are visiting Washington, D. C., for the first\ntime that they must visit a list of enumerated sites.  If the \nlist is long, they might infer that I do not think that there\nare any other sites that they  should necessarily try to \nsqueeze in.  But it is doubtful that they would infer that I\nam suggesting that they should  necessarily avoid seeing \nanything else that might catch their interest. \nIn short, the expressio unius canon is insufficient to sup-\nport the Court\u2019s interpretation. \nII \nThe Court\u2019s interpretation is  also inconsistent with the\ntext and structure of the Sentencing Reform Act. \nA \nStarting with the text, I note  three features that counsel \nagainst acceptance of the Court\u2019s interpretation. \nFirst , the relevant provisions of the Sentencing Reform \nAct lack language like that incl uded in other provisions of\nthe Act that limit a court\u2019s consideration of specified factors. \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 7 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nALITO, J., dissenting \nFor example, \u00a73582(a)\u2014the provision that directly precedes \nthe provision setting out the mandatory supervised-release\nfactors in \u00a73583\u2014expressly states that a judge\u2019s decision whether to impose a term of imprisonment may not be \nbased on a desire to \u201cpromo t[e] correction and rehabilita-\ntion.\u201d When \u201cCongress includ es particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts in-tentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or ex-\nclusion.\u201d Russello  v. United States , 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Or take \u00a73565(b),which (as amended in 1988) contains an implicit prohibition \non consideration of the sentencing factors. See 102 Stat. 4361. That provision mandates revocation of probation if\ncertain conditions are met, and Congress apparently gave\ncourts no discretion to even consider the sentencing factors.\nAs a result, the absence of any even remotely similar lan-\nguage in \u00a73583(e) is telling. \nSecond, we can infer that the Sentencing Reform Act al-\nlows a judge to consider all the sentencing factors because \nthere are some situations in which factors omitted from the \nlist of supervised-release factors must be considered.  One \nsuch situation occurs when a judge decides how to respondto a defendant\u2019s violation of the terms of supervised release\nbecause in that situation the judge must consider exactly \nwhat is set out in \u00a73553(a)(3), which is one of the sentencing factors omitted from the list of supervised-release factors.\nThat provision refers to \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d and when a judge is deciding what to do about a defendant \nwho has violated the terms of supervised release, the judge\nmust consider the available options, which include termi-\nnation, extension, modification, and revocation.  \u00a73583(e). \nBecause a term of supervised release is \u201cpart of a sentence,\u201d each one of these options changes the defendant\u2019s sentence. \nAnd therefore, this list of options constitutes a list of \u201cthe \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n 8 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nALITO, J., dissenting \nkinds of sentences available.\u201d2 \nConsideration of \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d may \nbe required during a revocati on proceeding for yet another \nreason. When a sentencing court revokes a term of super-\nvised release and sends the defendant back to prison, the \nmaximum period of additional confinement authorized de-\npends on the class of the underlying offense. See \n\u00a73583(e)(3).  So a sentencing court determining the permis-sible range of reimprisonment will necessarily consider the \n\u201ckinds of sentences\u201d authorize d under the statute of convic-\ntion. \nThird , and most important, the Court\u2019s interpretation\ncannot account for the inextricable relationship between the omitted sentencing factor at issue in these cases, i.e., \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A), and the sentencing factors that a judge mustconsider in deciding whether to  alter a term of supervised\nrelease. Recall that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) requires, among other things, consideration of \u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d and according to the Court, taking  that factor into account is \nprohibited. But it is undisputed that a judge must  consider \n\u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d when altering \na term of supervised release.  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1), 3583(e). Since \n\u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d is part of \u201cthe nature of theoffense,\u201d the Court\u2019s interpreta tion gives district judges ir -\nreconcilable instructions. \nAnother part of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) creates a similar problem \nfor the Court.  Section 3553(a)(2)(A) refers to \u201cthe need . . . to promote respect for the law,\u201d and because that provisionis omitted from the supervised-release factors, the Court \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2The Court argues that th ese options are not \u201ckinds of sentences\u201d be-\ncause the Sentencing Reform Act recognizes only three types of sen -\ntences: probation, fines, and imprisonment.  See ante, at 6, n. 4.  Accord -\ning to the Court, supervised release is not a \u201c \u2018kin[d] of sentence\u2019 \u201d but is\ninstead merely \u201ca component of a defendant\u2019s prison  sentence.\u201d Ibid.

It entirely ignores the rela-tionship between \u201cafford[ing] adequate deterrence\u201d (a man-\ndatory consideration) and \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law\u201d \n(outlawed under its interpretation).  And as for the conflict \nbetween requiring consideration of the \u201cnature and circum-\nstances of the offense\u201d and banning consideration of \u201cthe se -\nriousness of the offense,\u201d the Court\u2019s response is an elabo-\nrate theory that has no grounding in the statutory text.\nThe Court begins by claiming that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) relates\nsolely to retribution and not to any of the other three per-\nmitted goals of punishment\u2014deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation. See ante, at 13\u201314. But that is simply\nnot true with respect to two of the objectives to which\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) refers, i.e. , the need for a sentence to reflect \n\u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d and \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d These two factors implicate other purposes of\npunishment too.  For example, if the offense in question is\nvery serious, there is a heightened need for deterrence and incapacitation, and rehabilitation may be harder.  So the \nCourt\u2019s theory veers off course at the start. \nAfter that flawed beginning, the Court tells us that the\nsupervised-release factors operate as a kind of purpose fil-\nter. Section 3553(a)(2) enumerates four factors that, in the Court\u2019s view, reflect the four recognized purposes of punish-\nment. The Court tells us that the \u201cnature and circum-\nstances of the offense\u201d must be considered in light of one of \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  10 ESTERAS v.

The supervised-release factors, how-\never, include only three of th ose four purposes and exclude\nthe goal of retribution supposedly encapsulated in \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). So, in the Court\u2019s view, the supervised- \nrelease statute filters out \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) and thereby pro-\nhibits a court from any consideration of the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d in light of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s sup-posedly \u201cretributive focus\u201d and concern with the \n\u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  Ante , at 14 \nNone of this has any textual support, and it does not solve \nthe problem faced by a judge who is compelled to consider \nthe nature and circumstances of an offense but forbidden to consider its seriousness. If taken seriously, it does not alter\nin any way the information that judges may consider.  In -\nstead, it merely calls on them to probe their mental pro-cesses to ensure that no thoughts of retribution entered in.\n3 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3Here is an example. Suppose a de fendant\u2019s offense of conviction was \ninterstate travel in violation of a protective order prohibiting threats,\nharassment, or contact with his former wife.  See 18 U. S. C. \u00a72262(a).\nAnd suppose that the trial evidence  showed the defendant engaged in \nconduct that caused his former wife ve ry severe emotional distress.  After \nserving his sentence, the defendant is given supervised release but quickly violates a condition of release by resuming the very conduct that landed him in prison in the first plac e.  The judge must decide what to \ndo. Heeding the requirement to cons ider \u201cthe nature and circumstances\nof the offense,\u201d the judge calls to mind the trial evidence.  Then, as re-quired by the Sentencing Reform Ac t, the judge considers whether this \ninformation suggests that reimprisonment  is needed either to \u201cafford ad-\nequate deterrence,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2)(B) ( i.e., to cause the defendant to leave \nhis former wife alone), or to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the\ndefendant,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2)(C) ( i.e., to keep the defendant\u2019s former wife safe\nduring the period of reimprisonment).\nThe effect of the Court\u2019s filtering sc heme is to complicate the judge\u2019s\nconsideration of all these matters by demanding that he search his con-science and ask: \u201cHave I let any thou ght of retribution enter into my \nthinking?

These instructions fall into one of two categories.  Instructions in the first category\neither mandate consideration of  all the sentencing factors\n4 \nor require their consideration to the extent they are rele-\nvant to the type of sentence in question.5 By contrast, in-\nstructions in the second catego ry expressly prohibit consid -\neration of specific sentencing factors.6 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ntion.

See Tapia  v. United States , 564 U. S. \n319, 332 (2011).  Similarly, in \u00a73563(b), Congress confined the discretion\nof sentencing courts to a particular subset of the \u00a73553(a) factors.  Under that provision, sentencing courts may set conditions of probation \u201cto the \nextent that such conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2) and to the extent that such conditions involve only such deprivations of lib erty or property as are reasonably \nnecessary for the purposes indicated in section 3553(a)(2).\u201d  Congress\u2019s use of limiting language (\u201cto the ex tent that\u201d and \u201cas are reasonably nec -\nessary\u201d) makes its restrictive intent clear.  Another provision of the Act \nappears to go even further by removing a sentencing court\u2019s discretion to \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  12 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nALITO, J., dissenting \nWhat is remarkable about \u00a73583(e), which lists the man-\ndatory supervised-release factors, is that it does not fall intoeither of these categories. It  neither demands consideration \nof all relevant sentencing factors nor prohibits considera-\ntion of some or all of them.  Instead, it requires considera-\ntion of some of the mandatory sentencing factors but says\nnothing about the rest. The appropriate inference is that\n\u00a73583(e) is meant to have a different effect: namely, to give sentencing courts discretion to  consider the omitted factors.\nSuch discretion is consistent  with the Sentencing Reform \nAct\u2019s general approach to supervised release, which confers broad discretion on trial judges. In most cases, sentencing\ncourts \u201cmay include\u201d a term of supervised release \u201cas a \npart\u201d of \u201ca sentence to a term of imprisonment,\u201d \u00a73583(a),\nand \u201cmay\u201d terminate, extend, or  revoke supervised release,\n\u00a73583(e).\nThis grant of discretion tracks the background principles\nagainst which the Act was drafted, namely, \u201cthe established\ntradition of district courts\u2019 sentencing discretion.\u201d  Concep-\ncion v. United States , 597 U. S. 481, 495 (2022).  As we re-\ncently noted, \u201c[t]he only limit ations on a court\u2019s discretion \nto consider any relevant materials at an initial sentencing or in modifying that sentence are those set forth by Con-gress in a statute or by the Constitution.\u201d  Id., at 494; see \n\u00a73661. \u201cCongress is not shy about placing such limits\u201d onsentencing discretion, id., at 494, and its failure to do so in \n\u00a73583(e) permits the inference that sentencing courts re-\ntain discretion to consider \u201cany relevant materials,\u201d includ-\ning the omitted \u00a73553(a) factors, ibid.\n7 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nconsider the \u00a73553(a) factors at all.  Section 3565(b) provides that a sen -\ntencing court \u201cshall revoke [a] senten ce of probation\u201d if the defendant \npossesses controlled substances or firearms, refuses to comply with drugtesting, or fails a drug test more th an three times over the course of  a \nyear.  No mention of the \u00a73553(a) factors is made. \n7Congress\u2019s decision to omit \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) specifically has its own \nlogic. Congress may have sought to encourage sentencing courts to give \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n 13 Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025) \nALITO, J., dissenting \nIII \nA \nThe Court attempts to buttress its interpretation by cit-\ning statements made in two of our prior cases, but the hold-\nings in those cases were far afield from the question pre-\nsented here, and the comments in question simply provided \nbackground. In Tapia v. United States , 564 U. S. 319 \n(2011), we held that a sentence of imprisonment cannot beimposed or extended to foster a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\nBefore directly addressing that issue in Part III of the opin -\nion, Part II provided \u201cstatutory background.\u201d Id., at 323. \nAfter noting the four purposes of sentencing, the opinion\nstated that under the Sentencing Reform Act, \u201ca particular \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ngreater weight to the remaining purp oses of sentencing set forth in \n\u00a73553(a)(2) to ensure that \u201c[s]upervi sed release fulfills [its] rehabilitative\nends.\u201d United States  v. Johnson , 529 U. S. 53, 59 (2000).  But in doing\nso, Congress likely understood that sealing off any discretion to consider \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retributive factors would be impracticable.  Supervised \nrelease is \u201ca part of \u201d \u201ca term of imprisonment for\u201d the defendant\u2019s of-\nfense, \u00a73583(a), and when a sentencing court imposes a term of impris-\nonment for the offense, it must co nsider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), see \u00a73582(a).\nCongress may have rendered the three \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) factors discre -\ntionary because it understood that each  factor may apply in some, though \nnot all, hearings regarding the alteration of supervised release.  The need \n\u201cto promote respect for law\u201d strikes me as an evergreen concern when a\ncourt is considering what remedy best enables a defendant to \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  88 F. 4th 1163, 1167 (CA6 \n2023) (internal quotation marks omitte d).  But the need \u201cto provide just \npunishment for the offense\u201d seems less  relevant when a sentencing court \naddresses a violation of supervised re lease.  And the relevance of the re-\nmaining \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) fact or\u2014the need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the\noffense\u201d\u2014depends on context.  If, fo r example, a sentencing court decides \nto revoke supervised release following a defendant\u2019s violation, it must, as already explained, examine how Congress categorized the offense\u2019s \u201cseriousness\u201d to determine the author ized term of reimprisonment.  See \n\u00a73583(e)(3).  But if the court instead opts for a less-severe sanction, suchas the modification of a condition of release, it is not necessarily required to consider how Congress scored the underlying offense\u2019s \u201cseriousness.\u201d \nSee \u00a73583(e)(2). \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 14 ESTERAS v.

(emphasis in original).  Because the wording\nof \u00a73583(c) is similar to that of \u00a73583(e)\u2014the provision thatcontrols alteration of a term of supervised release\u2014the\nCourt today treats Tapia \u2019s statement as strong support for \nits decision. \nThis reads too much into what is plainly peripheral dicta.\nFor one thing, it is not even clear that the statement means\nwhat the Court claims.  The verb \u201cmay\u201d sometimes denotes \n\u201cpermission\u201d and sometimes denotes \u201cpossibility.\u201d  Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 1189 (2d ed. 2001). The Court reads the statement in Tapia to mean permis-\nsion: a judge may not  consider retribution because that is \nnot allowed. But the statement could also mean \u201cpossibil-\nity\u201d: a judge, as a matter of discretion, may choose not to \ntake retribution into account.  It is debatable which reading \nis better, and in any event, as the opinion stated twice, the \nstatement was merely \u201cstatuto ry background.\u201d  564 U. S., \nat 323, 326. Moreover, Tapia \u201cdealt with a different sen-\ntencing law\u201d concerned with imposing imprisonment, notsupervised release, and the Court\u2019s drive-by analysis of \n\u00a73583(c) did nothing to reckon with Congress\u2019s lack of \u201cex-\nplicit directions\u201d as to the om itted sentencing factors.  88 \nF. 4th 1163, 1168 (CA6 2023).

After emphasizing that sen-\ntencing judges have generally exercised broad discretion re -\ngarding the facts considered in sentencing determinations, \nthe opinion noted that Congress has sometimes imposed re-\nstrictions; as an illustration, it simply cited the statement \nmade in Tapia . See 597 U. S., at 494. \nWhatever weight these dicta merit, they are surely insuf-\nficient to support today\u2019s decision. \nB \nThe Court attempts to justify its interpretation by draw -\ning a hard line between the Act\u2019s primary penalties\u2014\n\u201c[f]ines, probation, and imprisonment\u201d\u2014and supervised re-\nlease. Ante , at 9. In its view, the former are a court\u2019s main \n\u201ctools for ensuring that a criminal defendant receives just \ndeserts for the original offense.\u201d Ibid.  But \u201c[w]hen a de-\nfendant violates the conditions of his supervised release,\u201d the Court reasons, \u201cit makes sense that a court must con-\nsider the forward-looking  ends of sentencing (deterrence,\nincapacitation, and rehabilitation), but may not consider the backward-looking purpose of retribution.\u201d Ante , at 10. \nThis argument exaggerates the distinction between the \ntwo classes of penalties to whic h the Court refers.  Contrary\nto the Court\u2019s suggestion, a deci sion about the revocation of\nsupervised release may call for consideration of certainbackward-looking factors.  For example, under \u00a73583(e)(3),the limits of the discretion enjoyed by a court considering\nthe revocation of supervised release depend on the class (A, \nB, C, or D) of the \u201cstatute for the offense that resulted in\n[the] term of supervised release.\u201d  Section 3583(e) also man-\ndates consideration of \u00a73553(a)(6), which, in turn, requiresconsideration of \u201cthe need to  avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar records whohave been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d  In assessing \nthat factor, a sentencing court must necessarily look back \nto the defendant\u2019s offense conduct and also consider the \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n 16 ESTERAS v. UNITED STATES \nALITO, J., dissenting \npast offense conduct of similarly situated defendants.\nA defendant\u2019s original offense may also be important\nwhen a judge is considering whether a violation of a condi-tion of supervised release is serious enough to justify send-\ning the violator back to prison for a particular length of \ntime. Consider a defendant co nvicted for the possession of \nchild pornography who later violates a special condition ofhis release restricting his viewing of any sexually explicit materials, including material that depicts teenagers who\nare not actually under the age of 18.  In such a case, the \nserious nature of the original crime may be thought to have a bearing on the implications of the later violation and the \nneed for reimprisonment to de ter the defendant from future\nbacksliding, to protect society from the consequences ofchild pornography, or to provide the opportunity for further\nrehabilitation efforts in prison. \nIt is revealing that the Court only half-heartedly buys its\nforward-looking/backward-looking distinction. In a foot-note, the Court refuses to take a position on the question\nwhether a sentencing court ma y revoke supervised release \nin retribution \u201cfor the violation of the conditions of the su-\npervised release.\u201d Ante , at 8, n. 5 (emphasis deleted). \nIV \nIn addition to all these faults, the Court\u2019s interpretation,\nas I emphasized at the outset of this opinion, defies common sense. \nThe Court\u2019s interpretation of which sentencing factors a \ncourt may consider in altering a term of supervised release \nmust also apply when a court is  initially imposing a term of \nsupervised release. The relevant wording in \u00a73583(c),which governs the imposition of supervised release, and \u00a73583(e), which governs the alteration of supervised re-\nlease, cannot be meaningfully distinguished.  But applying \nthe Court\u2019s interpretation to the original imposition of su-\npervised released creates a huge practical problem.

In imposing a prison term, a \ncourt must consider all of the 10 sentencing factors, but un-\nder today\u2019s reading of the Sentencing Reform Act, the court\nis prohibited from considering 2 of those factors when it\nturns to the issue of supervised release.  How this will work \nin practice is anyone\u2019s guess.  Must sentencing courts \u201cad -\njourn the hearing after imposing\u201d imprisonment and then\n\u201cstart over with a new unblemished inquiry\u201d and without \ngiving any thought to the omitted \u00a73553(a) factors?  88 \nF. 4th, at 1168. The Sixth Circuit feared that might be re-\nquired. Many district judges may soon face this problem because \u201c[t]he vast majority ( 95.1%)\u201d of offenders convicted \nof a felony or Class A misdemeanor are also \u201csentenced to \nterms of supervised release.\u201d United States Sentencing\nCommission, Federal Offenders Sentenced to Supervised \nRelease 50 (2010).  Indeed, in 2024, supervised release wasimposed in 50,865 cases.  See United States Sentencing Commission, 2024 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Sta-\ntistics 41. \nOther daunting practical problems will arise when judges\nare deciding whether to alter a defendant\u2019s term of super-\nvised release.  When sending a violator of supervised re-lease back to prison, a court must carefully control every \nword that is uttered to explain the decision.  Avoiding the \nlanguage of \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the of -\nfense,\u201d \u201crespect for the law,\u201d and \u201cjust punishment for the \noffense\u201d\u2014is obviously essential. But what about synonymsand other arguably related words and phrases?

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the predictive factors in this case has been further refined. While no new external facts about the case have emerged, the latest observation synthesizes the existing evidence into a clearer analytical framework, sharpening the central uncertainty that will determine the outcome of the certiorari petition.\n\n*   **Core Conflict (Stable):** The central legal dispute remains a clash between the petitioner's textualist and constitutional avoidance interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) and the government's more pragmatic, interconnected reading of the sentencing statutes. The petitioner has successfully framed this as Textualism & Constitutional Avoidance vs. Pragmatism & Statutory Interconnectedness.\n\n*   **Argument Strength Assessment (Stable):** My assessment of the certiorari-stage briefing is unchanged. The petitioner's reply brief was highly effective in demonstrating the practical, outcome-determinative nature of the circuit split and elevating the constitutional stakes by invoking *Haymond*, *Baldwin*, and *Gamble*. The government's failure to address Justice Breyer's controlling concurrence in *Haymond* remains a notable weakness in its opposition.\n\n*   **Key Certiorari Signals (Synthesized & Refined):** The latest reasoning has organized the known facts into a clear set of competing signals for and against a grant of certiorari:\n    *   **Pro-Grant Signal (Strong):** A clear, acknowledged, and recurring circuit split on a fundamental question of federal sentencing law.\n    *   **Pro-Grant Signal (Moderate):** The petitioner's framing of the issue through a textualist lens, coupled with a plausible constitutional avoidance argument rooted in *United States v. Haymond*, which may appeal to the current Court's jurisprudential leanings.\n    *   **Anti-Grant Signal (Strong):** The complete absence of *amicus curiae* briefs. This is a powerful negative signal, suggesting a lack of perceived national importance from key legal stakeholders like the ACLU, NACDL, or legal academics.\n\n*   **Information Gaps & Primary Uncertainty (Updated & Refined):**\n    *   **Closed Gap:** The factual gap concerning the existence of *amicus curiae* briefs is closed. None were filed.\n    *   **New Primary Uncertainty (Analytical):** The primary uncertainty is no longer factual but analytical. It has been precisely defined as: **How does the Supreme Court weigh a strong positive signal (a clean circuit split on a recurring statutory issue) against a strong negative signal (a total lack of amicus support)?** The prediction now hinges less on discovering new facts about this case and more on understanding the Court's general certiorari calculus when these specific factors are in conflict.\n\n*   **Confidence & Prediction Posture (Stable & Reinforced):** My confidence that the Court will grant certiorari remains **tempered**. The synthesis of pro- and anti-grant signals reinforces this cautious, watchful stance. The case presents a \"clean\" legal question, which the Court values, but the lack of external validation from amicus filers suggests it may not meet the Court's threshold for importance, making it a plausible but by no means certain candidate for a grant. The outcome depends on which of these competing signals the Justices find more compelling in their internal deliberations.",

The previous uncertainty regarding the grant of certiorari and the ultimate merits decision has been completely resolved.\n\n*   **Certiorari Granted (Resolved Uncertainty):** My previous primary uncertainty\u2014how the Court would weigh a clean circuit split against a lack of amicus support\u2014has been answered. The Court **granted certiorari on October 21, 2024**, consolidating this case with *Jaimez v. United States* and *Leaks v. United States*. This confirms that the existence of a \"deep and pervasive\" circuit split on a fundamental question of federal sentencing was a sufficiently strong signal to warrant the Court's review, overcoming the negative signal from the absence of amicus briefs.\n\n*   **Final Holding (New Factual Knowledge):** The Supreme Court **vacated the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and ruled in favor of the petitioner, Esteras.** In a decision issued on June 20, 2025, the Court held that a district court, when revoking a term of supervised release, **may not** consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014namely, \"the seriousness of the offense,\" \"promot[ing] respect for the law,\" and providing \"just punishment for the offense.\"\n\n*   **Majority Reasoning (New Legal Precedent):** The majority opinion, authored by Justice Barrett, is grounded in a textualist interpretation of the sentencing statutes. The core of the reasoning is the canon of statutory interpretation *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other).\n    *   **Statutory Omission:** The Court found that Congress's decision to list most of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in the supervised release revocation statute (\u00a7 3583(e)) while conspicuously omitting \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) was a deliberate choice that must be given effect.\n    *   **Statutory Structure:** This negative inference is reinforced by the fact that other sentencing provisions (e.g., for probation, fines) *do* incorporate the full list of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, making the omission for supervised release a \"distinction with a difference.\"\n    *   **Purpose of Supervised Release:** The Court's reading aligns with the established purpose of supervised release, which \"fulfills rehabilitative ends\" and is not meant as additional punishment for the original underlying \"offense.\" The factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) are retributive and backward-looking, tied to the original crime, whereas revocation decisions should be based on the forward-looking goals of deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\n    *   **Precedent:** The decision explicitly builds upon the reasoning in *Tapia v. United States* and *Concepcion v. United States*, which had previously interpreted the same statutory omission in the context of *imposing* supervised release.\n\n*   **Vote Breakdown (New Factual Knowledge):** The decision was **7-2**.\n    *   **Majority:** Justice Barrett wrote the opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Kagan, and Kavanaugh.\n    *   **Concurring in Part:** Justices Sotomayor and Jackson joined most of the opinion but not all parts. They also filed separate concurrences.\n    *   **Dissent:** Justice Alito filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Gorsuch.\n\n*   **Confirmation of Prior Analysis (Stable):** My prior assessment that the petitioner successfully framed the case as a contest between textualism and pragmatism proved correct. The textualist argument, centered on the clear omission in the statute, was the foundation of the Court's majority opinion. The prediction task is now complete, as the final ruling and its legal basis are known.",
