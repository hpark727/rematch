      "Does a Texas death-row inmate have standing to sue the state over its refusal to grant access to DNA testing under a law that allows such testing only when the person can demonstrate that exculpatory results would have prevented their conviction?"

      "Yes"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "In 1998, Ruben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for his involvement in the robbery and killing of Escolastica Harrison. After multiple appeals and habeas corpus petitions, Gutierrez sought DNA testing of evidence from the crime scene under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 64. Texas courts repeatedly denied his requests, in part because Chapter 64 does not authorize testing when exculpatory results might only affect punishment or sentencing.\n\nIn 2019, Gutierrez filed a federal lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Cameron County District Attorney Luis V. Saenz and others challenging the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez argued that Chapter 64 improperly limited the rights granted in another Texas statute (Article 11.071) governing successive habeas applications for death row inmates. The district court agreed, ruling that the interaction between these laws violated procedural due process by making the right to bring a successive habeas application to claim innocence of the death penalty \u201cillusory.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that Gutierrez had no standing to make this claim and vacated the district court\u2019s judgment.",

This action directly targets that identified information gap. \n\nTask EIG is 0.9 because obtaining the petitioner's brief is the single most important next step. It will move the analysis from a general theoretical framework of standing to the concrete legal arguments the Court will evaluate. My posterior belief about the outcome is highly sensitive to the specific way the petitioner frames their injury and the chain of causation for redressability. This information is essential for mapping the case onto the known jurisprudence of the individual justices. \n\nDesign EIG is 0.7 because this action strongly reinforces a core strategic principle: after identifying the key legal doctrine, the primary source briefs are the next critical data point. It provides a powerful example of how to sequence information gathering, prioritizing the petitioner's brief to frame the central arguments in a procedural case.

Respondent Luis Saenz, in his official \ncapacity as the District Attorney of Cameron County, \nTexas, was a defendant in the district court, along \nwith Felix Sauceda, Jr., in his official capacity as \nChief of the Brownsville Police Department. Both Mr. \nSaenz and Mr. Sauceda were named as defendants \nbecause they are custodians of the biological evidence \nof which Petitioner seeks DNA testing. Both were \nlisted as appellants in the court of appeals, and both \nare respondents before this Court.  \n \n \nBryan Collier, Executive Director of Texas \nDepartment of Criminal Justice; Lorie Davis, Director \nof Texas Department of Criminal Justice; and Billy \nLewis, Warden, Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice, were additional defendants in the district \ncourt because of their connection to Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim regarding allowing a spiritual advisor in the \nexecution chamber. They are not parties to the appeal \nof the declaratory judgment at issue in this case. \n \n \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n \nQUESTION PRESENTED .......................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING ........................... ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTION .......................................................... 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED ......................................... 2 \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 4 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 8 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 23 \nARGUMENT ............................................................. 27 \nI.

The court \nof appeals denied a petition for rehearing and \nrehearing en banc on May 29, 2024. Petitioner filed a \ntimely petition for writ of certiorari on June 25, 2024, \nwhich was granted on October 4, 2024. The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1).  \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of \nlaw . . . .  \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, \nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of \nany State or Territory or the District of \nColumbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, \nany citizen of the United States or other \nperson within the jurisdiction thereof to the \ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and \nlaws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper \nproceeding for redress . . . .  \n \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA \ntesting under this chapter only if the \nconvicted \nperson \nestablishes \nby \na \npreponderance of the evidence that the person \nwould not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA \ntesting . . . .  \n\n3 \n \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of \nhabeas corpus is filed after filing an initial \napplication, a court may not consider the \nmerits of or grant relief based on the \nsubsequent \napplication \nunless \nthat \napplication contains sufficient specific facts \nestablishing that by clear and convincing \nevidence, but for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would \nhave answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to \nthe jury in the applicant\u2019s trial . . . . \n \nArticle 37.071 \u00a7 2(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal \nProcedure provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nOn conclusion of the presentation of the \nevidence, the court shall submit the following \nissues to the jury: \n \n(2) in cases in which the jury charge at the \nguilt or innocence stage permitted the jury to \nfind the defendant guilty as a party under \nSections 7.01 and 7.02, Penal Code, whether \nthe defendant actually caused the death of the \ndeceased or did not actually cause the death \nof the deceased but intended to kill the \ndeceased or another or anticipated that a \nhuman life would be taken. \n \n\n4 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nIn Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this \nCourt held that Rodney Reed had standing to pursue \na declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s statute violates due \nprocess, it is \u201c\u2018substantially likely\u2019 that the state \nprosecutor would abide by such a court order\u201d (quoting \nUtah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nIn this case, Ruben Gutierrez, like Reed, sought a \ndeclaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute is unconstitutional. For over ten years, \nGutierrez, a death-sentenced prisoner, has sought \nDNA testing to prove that his limited culpability in \nthe underlying offense renders him ineligible for the \ndeath penalty, both under Texas law and under this \nCourt\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. Gutierrez \nalleged that Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute\u2014Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) \n\u2014violates due process by permitting DNA testing only \nwhere favorable results would go to the defendant\u2019s \nactual innocence, rather than his ineligibility for the \ndeath penalty, even though Texas law provides an \navenue for state habeas relief on a death-ineligibility \nclaim. The district court granted declaratory relief on \nthat basis.  \n \nBut on appeal, a divided panel of the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that \nGutierrez lacked standing to bring his claim. The \n\n5 \n \nmajority formulated its own novel test, under which a \nplaintiff\u2019s injury is not redressable unless the court \nmakes a record-scouring, predictive determination \nthat the defendants in a particular case will actually \ncomply with a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. \nThis test goes far beyond the analysis this Court \nconducted in Reed, and it allows state actors to defeat \nArticle III standing simply by refusing to comply with \na federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning rested heavily on a \nstatement from an earlier Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals (CCA) decision. In that 2011 decision, the \nCCA stated that the \u201crecord facts\u201d from trial \nestablished that Gutierrez would still be death \neligible even if he obtained favorable DNA results. \nBased on that statement, Respondents contended that \nthey would not agree to DNA testing, notwithstanding \na declaratory judgment against them. And the Fifth \nCircuit majority held that Respondents\u2019 steadfast \nrefusal to comply on those grounds meant that \nGutierrez lacked standing to pursue relief under \n\u00a7 1983. \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis badly misapprehends \nthe law of standing. Gutierrez seeks \u00a7 1983 relief \nagainst Respondents, namely, a declaration that \nTexas\u2019s statutory restrictions on DNA testing, on \nwhich Respondents rely, violate due process by \nforeclosing a death-eligibility claim that Texas law \notherwise authorizes. The CCA\u2019s decision does not \nprevent Respondents from providing access to the \nevidence. Respondents are not constrained by the \nCCA\u2019s prior rulings and can grant access to the \n\n6 \n \nrequested evidence at any time. In this very case, \nRespondents have previously been unopposed to DNA \ntesting notwithstanding what the CCA said about \nGutierrez\u2019s death eligibility. And, more recently, \nRespondents \ncharacterized \nthe \nfederal \ncourt\u2019s \ndeclaratory judgment as \u201cbinding.\u201d \n \nGutierrez\u2019s injury is redressable by a declaration \nstating that the statutory basis for Respondents\u2019 \nrefusal of access offends due process, just as in Reed. \nRespondents are free to argue in a later proceeding in \nstate court that the DNA evidence does not entitle \nGutierrez to relief on a state habeas claim, but \nwhatever may happen in a future state case does not \ndeprive Gutierrez of standing in this current federal \none. \n \nThat conclusion is buttressed by the many decades \nof precedent from this Court holding that a litigant \ndoes not need to establish that he would obtain \nsubstantive relief if a procedural violation were \nremedied in order to have standing to bring that \nprocedural challenge. See Peralta v. Heights Med. \nCtr., 485 U.S. 80, 86\u201387 (1988); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 \nU.S. 67, 87 (1972); Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, 237 \nU.S. 413, 424 (1915). As the Court recently put it in \nrecounting the law governing procedural injuries, \u201cthe \nfact that the defendant might well come to the same \ndecision after abiding by the contested procedural \nrequirement does not deprive a plaintiff of standing.\u201d \nDepartment of Education v. Brown, 600 U.S. 551, 561\u2013\n62 (2023). Brown involved the more typical scenario \nwhere the government actor alleged to have violated \nsome procedural requirement is the same government \n\n7 \n \nactor charged with deciding the merits of the \nunderlying substantive claim. Even then, the federal \nplaintiff need not establish success on the substance \nof the claim to have standing to challenge a procedural \nviolation. Gutierrez\u2019s standing to seek relief for his \nprocedural due process injury\u2014Respondents\u2019 failure \nto permit DNA testing to allow him to challenge his \nsentence\u2014is even clearer because Respondents will \nnot decide his ultimate claim for relief. Gutierrez has \nstanding to seek relief from Respondents for his due \nprocess injury even if the CCA might ultimately deny \nrelief. \n \nMore fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s record-\ncombing method invites all manner of errors because \nit premises the purely federal question of standing on \nsubtleties of state law. Thus, without the benefit of \nformal briefing on either its new test or Reed itself, \nthe Fifth Circuit erroneously presumed that the \nCCA\u2019s opinions in the Chapter 64 proceedings \ninevitably doom any post-DNA claim of death \nineligibility. They do not. While the CCA has stated \nthat DNA evidence alone, considered against the \n\u201crecord facts\u201d of trial, would not alter Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility, Gutierrez would be presenting DNA \nevidence alongside other evidence that the CCA has \nnever \nconsidered. \nThat \nincludes \nevidence \ndemonstrating \nthat \nan \nalternate \nsuspect \nmasterminded \nthe \nplot \nas \nwell \nas \nevidence \nundermining eyewitness identifications of Gutierrez \nnear the scene of the offense.   \n \nThe CCA has never considered the import of this \nevidence in connection with favorable DNA results, \n\n8 \n \nand this Court need not and should not predict the \noutcome of that state proceeding to decide this one. \nThis case presents the narrow threshold question of \nwhether Gutierrez has standing to challenge Texas\u2019s \nDNA testing statute. Because a favorable decision on \nthat issue would improve his legal position vis-\u00e0-vis \nRespondents\u2014as well as improve his position in his \nultimate state court challenge\u2014this Court should \nreverse the Fifth Circuit and hold that Gutierrez has \nstanding to seek relief under \u00a7 1983 regardless of \nRespondents\u2019 intention not to comply with the \ndeclaration.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder \nand related offenses in the 1998 robbery and murder \nof Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death. \nThe prosecution\u2019s theory at trial was that Gutierrez \nand two others planned to lure Ms. Harrison out of her \nmobile home, where she kept large amounts of cash, \nand then steal the cash from her empty dwelling. The \nevidence showed that, contrary to that plan, two men \nentered the mobile home and Ms. Harrison was \nstabbed to death with two screwdrivers. The \nprosecution argued that Gutierrez was one of the two \nkillers. \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who \nmaintains that he neither entered Ms. Harrison\u2019s \nhouse nor knew anyone would be home, much less \nharmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing under \nChapter 64 of items recovered from the crime scene, \nincluding a blood-stained shirt belonging to Ms. \nHarrison\u2019s nephew and housemate, scrapings from \n\n9 \n \nunderneath Ms. Harrison\u2019s fingernails, a loose hair \nwrapped around one of her fingers, and various blood \nsamples from within the mobile home. These items \nwere collected from the crime scene by detectives and \ncontinue to be preserved because they contain \nbiological material that can reveal who was in Ms. \nHarrison\u2019s home during the crime. Yet this critical \nevidence has never been tested. \nGutierrez was prosecuted and convicted under \nTexas\u2019s expansive law of parties. Under Texas law, \neven those who do not actually kill, intend to kill, or \nanticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of \ncapital murder as a result of their participation in the \nunderlying felony. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 7.01. Those \nconvicted of capital murder are subject to either life \nimprisonment or the death penalty. Tex. Penal Code \n\u00a7 12.31. But not all who are guilty of capital murder \nunder the law of parties are eligible for the death \npenalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder \nscheme does not allow an individual to be put to death \nfor merely being a party to a murder.\u201d).  \nIn order to sentence a defendant to death, Texas \njurors are required to answer \u201cwhether the defendant \nactually caused the death of the deceased or did not \nactually cause the death of the deceased but intended \nto kill the deceased or another or anticipated that a \nhuman life would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. \n37.071; see also 24 RR 129.1 Moreover, the Eighth \nAmendment prohibits the death penalty for a \n \n1 Trial testimony is cited as volume number, followed by RR \n(Reporter\u2019s Record), followed by the page number.  \n\n10 \n \nparticipant in a felony murder unless his participation \nin the underlying felony was \u201cmajor\u201d and he acted \nwith at least reckless indifference to human life. See \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 158 (1987); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982). Gutierrez has fought for \nover a decade to test the biological evidence collected \nat the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be \nkilled, and that he did not act as a major participant \nin the underlying felony.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern \nDNA testing can provide powerful new evidence \nunlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office \nv. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 62 (2009). Since the time of \nGutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its DNA testing \nprotocol to require mandatory testing of all items with \nbiological material in capital cases where the State \npursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. \nart. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA \ntesting of these items already would have happened.  \nTrial evidence \nGutierrez was one of several men who frequently \nvisited and drank with Ms. Harrison\u2019s nephew, Avel \nCuellar, who lived with Ms. Harrison at a mobile \nhome park. 18 RR 17\u201318. Ms. Harrison was found in \nher home beaten and stabbed to death with two \nscrewdrivers. 19 RR 224\u201342. She kept a large amount \nof cash in her home; police estimated that \napproximately $600,000 had been stolen. 18 RR 109\u2013\n10. The police recovered a substantial amount of \nphysical evidence from the crime scene and during the \n\n11 \n \nautopsy, but the State did not subject any of the \nevidence to DNA testing.  \nPolice arrested Gutierrez\u2019s codefendants Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia. Both codefendants gave \nstatements implicating themselves and Gutierrez in \nthe offense, but neither of their statements was \nintroduced at trial. Both Garcia and Gracia were \ncharged with killing Ms. Harrison. Gracia was \nreleased on bond and absconded; his whereabouts \nremain unknown today. Garcia pled guilty and was \nsentenced to life imprisonment. \nPolice arrested Gutierrez, and he gave three \nstatements. The first and second statements indicated \nGutierrez \u201cplanned the whole rip off,\u201d but that his \nplan was that they steal from Ms. Harrison\u2019s empty \nhome and in no way contemplated that she would be \ninjured or killed. 18 RR 165\u201378. The third statement \nput Gutierrez inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s house at the time \nof the murder, but he denied assaulting her and \npointed to Cuellar as the mastermind of the crime. 19 \nRR 66\u201373. Gutierrez has maintained since before his \ntrial that his third statement was false and was \nobtained by coercion. \nThe primary evidence at trial was Gutierrez\u2019s third \nstatement. Additionally, while Gutierrez was known \nto frequent the mobile home park to visit friends who \nlived there, the lead detective, Gilbert Garcia, \ntestified that several witnesses saw Gutierrez and \nanother man near Ms. Harrison\u2019s home \u201caround the \ntime that the pathologist estimated the time of death \nwas.\u201d 19 RR 40. \n\n12 \n \nThe State\u2019s theory of the case at trial was that \nGutierrez personally murdered Ms. Harrison to \nprevent her from identifying him as one of the robbers. \n17 RR 33; 20 RR 72. Under the State\u2019s theory, the two \nmen present at the scene of the offense were Garcia \n(who pled guilty) and Gutierrez. Gracia (who \nabsconded) was the getaway driver. Cuellar\u2014the \nvictim\u2019s nephew who resided with her and purportedly \ndiscovered her body\u2014was not, according to the State, \ninvolved in the crime.  \nCuellar relied on Ms. Harrison for money. 17 RR \n76\u201377, 144. He was the initial suspect in her murder \nand frequently spoke about how much money Ms. \nHarrison kept in her home. 18 RR 46, 111. One \nneighbor told police that Ms. Harrison was afraid of \nCuellar \u201cbecause of violence.\u201d 18 RR 21. Another said \nMs. Harrison would get mad when Cuellar would ask \nher for money. 17 RR 262. A friend of Ms. Harrison\u2019s \nreported to police that Cuellar was acting strangely \nthe night of the murder. 18 RR 250. Cuellar\u2019s half-\nbrother told a detective that Ms. Harrison was afraid \nof Cuellar, and that he suspected Cuellar killed her. \n17 RR 56\u201357.  \nCuellar testified at trial that he spent most of the \nafternoon and evening of the day Ms. Harrison was \nkilled drinking at a VFW hall. 17 RR 111\u201312, 137, 154. \nAfter an absence from the VFW hall, he gave a \nwaitress a $100 bill as a tip. 19 RR 96. Cuellar\u2019s salary \nat the time was $150 per week. 17 RR 282\u201383. He \nreturned home at about 1:00 AM the next morning \nand claimed to have discovered his aunt\u2019s body in her \nbedroom, where she had been assaulted and killed. 17 \nRR 113\u201317. \n\n13 \n \nGutierrez \nmaintained \nthroughout \nthe \ntrial \nproceedings that although he was aware of a burglary, \nhe was not present at the scene\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n5: 20241203152150911_23-780920Affidavit20of20Service.json (score: 0.440)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-7809 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nLUIS SAENZ, ET AL., \nRespondents. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK  \n) \n  \n                   \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK \n) \n \nI, Julie Connor, being duly sworn according to law and being over the \nage of 18, upon my oath depose and say that: \n \nI am retained by Counsel of Record for Petitioner. \n \nThat on the 3rd day of December, 2024, I served the within Brief for \nPetitioner in the above-captioned matter upon: \n \nWilliam Francis Cole  \nOffice of the Attorney General of Texas \nP.O.

The court \nof appeals denied a petition for rehearing and \nrehearing en banc on May 29, 2024. Petitioner filed a \ntimely petition for writ of certiorari on June 25, 2024, \nwhich was granted on October 4, 2024. The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1).  \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of \nlaw . . . .  \n \nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, \nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of \nany State or Territory or the District of \nColumbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, \nany citizen of the United States or other \nperson within the jurisdiction thereof to the \ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and \nlaws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper \nproceeding for redress . . . .  \n \nArticle 64.03(a)(2)(A) of the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nA convicting court may order forensic DNA \ntesting under this chapter only if the \nconvicted \nperson \nestablishes \nby \na \npreponderance of the evidence that the person \nwould not have been convicted if exculpatory \nresults had been obtained through DNA \ntesting . . . .  \n\n3 \n \n \nArticle 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) of the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nIf a subsequent application for a writ of \nhabeas corpus is filed after filing an initial \napplication, a court may not consider the \nmerits of or grant relief based on the \nsubsequent \napplication \nunless \nthat \napplication contains sufficient specific facts \nestablishing that by clear and convincing \nevidence, but for a violation of the United \nStates Constitution no rational juror would \nhave answered in the state\u2019s favor one or more \nof the special issues that were submitted to \nthe jury in the applicant\u2019s trial . . . . \n \nArticle 37.071 \u00a7 2(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal \nProcedure provides, in pertinent part:  \n \nOn conclusion of the presentation of the \nevidence, the court shall submit the following \nissues to the jury: \n \n(2) in cases in which the jury charge at the \nguilt or innocence stage permitted the jury to \nfind the defendant guilty as a party under \nSections 7.01 and 7.02, Penal Code, whether \nthe defendant actually caused the death of the \ndeceased or did not actually cause the death \nof the deceased but intended to kill the \ndeceased or another or anticipated that a \nhuman life would be taken. \n \n\n4 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nIn Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this \nCourt held that Rodney Reed had standing to pursue \na declaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute was unconstitutional because \u201cReed \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact,\u201d the named \ndefendant \u201ccaused Reed\u2019s injury,\u201d and if a federal \ncourt concludes that Texas\u2019s statute violates due \nprocess, it is \u201c\u2018substantially likely\u2019 that the state \nprosecutor would abide by such a court order\u201d (quoting \nUtah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002)).  \n \nIn this case, Ruben Gutierrez, like Reed, sought a \ndeclaratory judgment that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute is unconstitutional. For over ten years, \nGutierrez, a death-sentenced prisoner, has sought \nDNA testing to prove that his limited culpability in \nthe underlying offense renders him ineligible for the \ndeath penalty, both under Texas law and under this \nCourt\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. Gutierrez \nalleged that Texas\u2019s DNA testing statute\u2014Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (\u201cChapter 64\u201d) \n\u2014violates due process by permitting DNA testing only \nwhere favorable results would go to the defendant\u2019s \nactual innocence, rather than his ineligibility for the \ndeath penalty, even though Texas law provides an \navenue for state habeas relief on a death-ineligibility \nclaim. The district court granted declaratory relief on \nthat basis.  \n \nBut on appeal, a divided panel of the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that \nGutierrez lacked standing to bring his claim. The \n\n5 \n \nmajority formulated its own novel test, under which a \nplaintiff\u2019s injury is not redressable unless the court \nmakes a record-scouring, predictive determination \nthat the defendants in a particular case will actually \ncomply with a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. \nThis test goes far beyond the analysis this Court \nconducted in Reed, and it allows state actors to defeat \nArticle III standing simply by refusing to comply with \na federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning rested heavily on a \nstatement from an earlier Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals (CCA) decision. In that 2011 decision, the \nCCA stated that the \u201crecord facts\u201d from trial \nestablished that Gutierrez would still be death \neligible even if he obtained favorable DNA results. \nBased on that statement, Respondents contended that \nthey would not agree to DNA testing, notwithstanding \na declaratory judgment against them. And the Fifth \nCircuit majority held that Respondents\u2019 steadfast \nrefusal to comply on those grounds meant that \nGutierrez lacked standing to pursue relief under \n\u00a7 1983. \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis badly misapprehends \nthe law of standing. Gutierrez seeks \u00a7 1983 relief \nagainst Respondents, namely, a declaration that \nTexas\u2019s statutory restrictions on DNA testing, on \nwhich Respondents rely, violate due process by \nforeclosing a death-eligibility claim that Texas law \notherwise authorizes. The CCA\u2019s decision does not \nprevent Respondents from providing access to the \nevidence. Respondents are not constrained by the \nCCA\u2019s prior rulings and can grant access to the \n\n6 \n \nrequested evidence at any time. In this very case, \nRespondents have previously been unopposed to DNA \ntesting notwithstanding what the CCA said about \nGutierrez\u2019s death eligibility. And, more recently, \nRespondents \ncharacterized \nthe \nfederal \ncourt\u2019s \ndeclaratory judgment as \u201cbinding.\u201d \n \nGutierrez\u2019s injury is redressable by a declaration \nstating that the statutory basis for Respondents\u2019 \nrefusal of access offends due process, just as in Reed. \nRespondents are free to argue in a later proceeding in \nstate court that the DNA evidence does not entitle \nGutierrez to relief on a state habeas claim, but \nwhatever may happen in a future state case does not \ndeprive Gutierrez of standing in this current federal \none. \n \nThat conclusion is buttressed by the many decades \nof precedent from this Court holding that a litigant \ndoes not need to establish that he would obtain \nsubstantive relief if a procedural violation were \nremedied in order to have standing to bring that \nprocedural challenge. See Peralta v. Heights Med. \nCtr., 485 U.S. 80, 86\u201387 (1988); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 \nU.S. 67, 87 (1972); Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, 237 \nU.S. 413, 424 (1915). As the Court recently put it in \nrecounting the law governing procedural injuries, \u201cthe \nfact that the defendant might well come to the same \ndecision after abiding by the contested procedural \nrequirement does not deprive a plaintiff of standing.\u201d \nDepartment of Education v. Brown, 600 U.S. 551, 561\u2013\n62 (2023). Brown involved the more typical scenario \nwhere the government actor alleged to have violated \nsome procedural requirement is the same government \n\n7 \n \nactor charged with deciding the merits of the \nunderlying substantive claim. Even then, the federal \nplaintiff need not establish success on the substance \nof the claim to have standing to challenge a procedural \nviolation. Gutierrez\u2019s standing to seek relief for his \nprocedural due process injury\u2014Respondents\u2019 failure \nto permit DNA testing to allow him to challenge his \nsentence\u2014is even clearer because Respondents will \nnot decide his ultimate claim for relief. Gutierrez has \nstanding to seek relief from Respondents for his due \nprocess injury even if the CCA might ultimately deny \nrelief. \n \nMore fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s record-\ncombing method invites all manner of errors because \nit premises the purely federal question of standing on \nsubtleties of state law. Thus, without the benefit of \nformal briefing on either its new test or Reed itself, \nthe Fifth Circuit erroneously presumed that the \nCCA\u2019s opinions in the Chapter 64 proceedings \ninevitably doom any post-DNA claim of death \nineligibility. They do not. While the CCA has stated \nthat DNA evidence alone, considered against the \n\u201crecord facts\u201d of trial, would not alter Gutierrez\u2019s \ndeath eligibility, Gutierrez would be presenting DNA \nevidence alongside other evidence that the CCA has \nnever \nconsidered. \nThat \nincludes \nevidence \ndemonstrating \nthat \nan \nalternate \nsuspect \nmasterminded \nthe \nplot \nas \nwell \nas \nevidence \nundermining eyewitness identifications of Gutierrez \nnear the scene of the offense.   \n \nThe CCA has never considered the import of this \nevidence in connection with favorable DNA results, \n\n8 \n \nand this Court need not and should not predict the \noutcome of that state proceeding to decide this one. \nThis case presents the narrow threshold question of \nwhether Gutierrez has standing to challenge Texas\u2019s \nDNA testing statute. Because a favorable decision on \nthat issue would improve his legal position vis-\u00e0-vis \nRespondents\u2014as well as improve his position in his \nultimate state court challenge\u2014this Court should \nreverse the Fifth Circuit and hold that Gutierrez has \nstanding to seek relief under \u00a7 1983 regardless of \nRespondents\u2019 intention not to comply with the \ndeclaration.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nRuben Gutierrez was convicted of capital murder \nand related offenses in the 1998 robbery and murder \nof Escolastica Harrison and was sentenced to death. \nThe prosecution\u2019s theory at trial was that Gutierrez \nand two others planned to lure Ms. Harrison out of her \nmobile home, where she kept large amounts of cash, \nand then steal the cash from her empty dwelling. The \nevidence showed that, contrary to that plan, two men \nentered the mobile home and Ms. Harrison was \nstabbed to death with two screwdrivers. The \nprosecution argued that Gutierrez was one of the two \nkillers. \nFor the last thirteen years, Gutierrez\u2014who \nmaintains that he neither entered Ms. Harrison\u2019s \nhouse nor knew anyone would be home, much less \nharmed\u2014has been seeking DNA testing under \nChapter 64 of items recovered from the crime scene, \nincluding a blood-stained shirt belonging to Ms. \nHarrison\u2019s nephew and housemate, scrapings from \n\n9 \n \nunderneath Ms. Harrison\u2019s fingernails, a loose hair \nwrapped around one of her fingers, and various blood \nsamples from within the mobile home. These items \nwere collected from the crime scene by detectives and \ncontinue to be preserved because they contain \nbiological material that can reveal who was in Ms. \nHarrison\u2019s home during the crime. Yet this critical \nevidence has never been tested. \nGutierrez was prosecuted and convicted under \nTexas\u2019s expansive law of parties. Under Texas law, \neven those who do not actually kill, intend to kill, or \nanticipate someone would be killed can be guilty of \ncapital murder as a result of their participation in the \nunderlying felony. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 7.01. Those \nconvicted of capital murder are subject to either life \nimprisonment or the death penalty. Tex. Penal Code \n\u00a7 12.31. But not all who are guilty of capital murder \nunder the law of parties are eligible for the death \npenalty. See Johnson v. State, 853 S.W.2d 527, 535 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (\u201cThe Texas capital murder \nscheme does not allow an individual to be put to death \nfor merely being a party to a murder.\u201d).  \nIn order to sentence a defendant to death, Texas \njurors are required to answer \u201cwhether the defendant \nactually caused the death of the deceased or did not \nactually cause the death of the deceased but intended \nto kill the deceased or another or anticipated that a \nhuman life would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. \n37.071; see also 24 RR 129.1 Moreover, the Eighth \nAmendment prohibits the death penalty for a \n \n1 Trial testimony is cited as volume number, followed by RR \n(Reporter\u2019s Record), followed by the page number.  \n\n10 \n \nparticipant in a felony murder unless his participation \nin the underlying felony was \u201cmajor\u201d and he acted \nwith at least reckless indifference to human life. See \nTison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 158 (1987); Enmund v. \nFlorida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982). Gutierrez has fought for \nover a decade to test the biological evidence collected \nat the crime scene to establish that he did not actually \nkill, intend to kill, or anticipate someone would be \nkilled, and that he did not act as a major participant \nin the underlying felony.  \nTexas statutes embrace the fact that \u201c[m]odern \nDNA testing can provide powerful new evidence \nunlike anything known before.\u201d Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office \nv. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 62 (2009). Since the time of \nGutierrez\u2019s trial, Texas has changed its DNA testing \nprotocol to require mandatory testing of all items with \nbiological material in capital cases where the State \npursues the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. \nart. 38.43. If this crime were committed today, DNA \ntesting of these items already would have happened.  \nTrial evidence \nGutierrez was one of several men who frequently \nvisited and drank with Ms. Harrison\u2019s nephew, Avel \nCuellar, who lived with Ms. Harrison at a mobile \nhome park. 18 RR 17\u201318. Ms. Harrison was found in \nher home beaten and stabbed to death with two \nscrewdrivers. 19 RR 224\u201342. She kept a large amount \nof cash in her home; police estimated that \napproximately $600,000 had been stolen. 18 RR 109\u2013\n10. The police recovered a substantial amount of \nphysical evidence from the crime scene and during the \n\n11 \n \nautopsy, but the State did not subject any of the \nevidence to DNA testing.  \nPolice arrested Gutierrez\u2019s codefendants Rene \nGarcia and Pedro Gracia. Both codefendants gave \nstatements implicating themselves and Gutierrez in \nthe offense, but neither of their statements was \nintroduced at trial. Both Garcia and Gracia were \ncharged with killing Ms. Harrison. Gracia was \nreleased on bond and absconded; his whereabouts \nremain unknown today. Garcia pled guilty and was \nsentenced to life imprisonment. \nPolice arrested Gutierrez, and he gave three \nstatements. The first and second statements indicated \nGutierrez \u201cplanned the whole rip off,\u201d but that his \nplan was that they steal from Ms. Harrison\u2019s empty \nhome and in no way contemplated that she would be \ninjured or killed. 18 RR 165\u201378. The third statement \nput Gutierrez inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s house at the time \nof the murder, but he denied assaulting her and \npointed to Cuellar as the mastermind of the crime. 19 \nRR 66\u201373. Gutierrez has maintained since before his \ntrial that his third statement was false and was \nobtained by coercion. \nThe primary evidence at trial was Gutierrez\u2019s third \nstatement. Additionally, while Gutierrez was known \nto frequent the mobile home park to visit friends who \nlived there, the lead detective, Gilbert Garcia, \ntestified that several witnesses saw Gutierrez and \nanother man near Ms. Harrison\u2019s home \u201caround the \ntime that the pathologist estimated the time of death \nwas.\u201d 19 RR 40. \n\n12 \n \nThe State\u2019s theory of the case at trial was that \nGutierrez personally murdered Ms. Harrison to \nprevent her from identifying him as one of the robbers. \n17 RR 33; 20 RR 72. Under the State\u2019s theory, the two \nmen present at the scene of the offense were Garcia \n(who pled guilty) and Gutierrez. Gracia (who \nabsconded) was the getaway driver. Cuellar\u2014the \nvictim\u2019s nephew who resided with her and purportedly \ndiscovered her body\u2014was not, according to the State, \ninvolved in the crime.  \nCuellar relied on Ms. Harrison for money. 17 RR \n76\u201377, 144. He was the initial suspect in her murder \nand frequently spoke about how much money Ms. \nHarrison kept in her home. 18 RR 46, 111. One \nneighbor told police that Ms. Harrison was afraid of \nCuellar \u201cbecause of violence.\u201d 18 RR 21. Another said \nMs. Harrison would get mad when Cuellar would ask \nher for money. 17 RR 262. A friend of Ms. Harrison\u2019s \nreported to police that Cuellar was acting strangely \nthe night of the murder. 18 RR 250. Cuellar\u2019s half-\nbrother told a detective that Ms. Harrison was afraid \nof Cuellar, and that he suspected Cuellar killed her. \n17 RR 56\u201357.  \nCuellar testified at trial that he spent most of the \nafternoon and evening of the day Ms. Harrison was \nkilled drinking at a VFW hall. 17 RR 111\u201312, 137, 154. \nAfter an absence from the VFW hall, he gave a \nwaitress a $100 bill as a tip. 19 RR 96. Cuellar\u2019s salary \nat the time was $150 per week. 17 RR 282\u201383. He \nreturned home at about 1:00 AM the next morning \nand claimed to have discovered his aunt\u2019s body in her \nbedroom, where she had been assaulted and killed. 17 \nRR 113\u201317. \n\n13 \n \nGutierrez \nmaintained \nthroughout \nthe \ntrial \nproceedings that although he was aware of a burglary, \nhe was not present at the scene of the offense, did not \nenter the victim\u2019s home, did not plan the victim\u2019s \nmurder, did not participate in the victim\u2019s murder, did \nnot know that his co-defendants intended to commit \nmurder, and could not have reasonably anticipated \nthat his co-defendants intended to commit murder.  \nThe jury returned a general verdict finding \nGutierrez guilty of capital murder. At the sentencing \nphase, the jury was required to answer whether the \nState had proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that \nRuben Gutierrez, the defendant himself, actually \ncaused the death of Escolastica Harrison, . . . or, if he \ndid not actually cause the deceased\u2019s death, that he \nintended to kill the deceased or that he anticipated \nthat a human life would be taken.\u201d 24 RR 129. The \njury answered yes, and Gutierrez was sentenced to \ndeath.  \nGutierrez\u2019s appellate, state post-conviction, and \nfederal habeas challenges were denied. See Gutierrez \nv. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 373\u201375 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nInitial requests for DNA testing \nGutierrez\u2019s first attempt to get DNA testing of the \nbiological material collected in his case was denied by \nthe trial court and the CCA in 2011. JA 567a\u2013604a. \nThe CCA held that Gutierrez was \u201cat fault\u201d for not \nseeking DNA testing earlier, under a provision of \nChapter 64, since repealed, that prohibited DNA \ntesting to prisoners who failed to seek such testing at \nthe time of trial. Based on representations by the \nState, the CCA also ruled that one of the pieces of \n\n14 \n \nevidence he sought to test\u2014the hair around the \nvictim\u2019s finger\u2014was not in State custody and could \nnot be tested. JA 594a\u2013596a.  \nThe CCA also relied heavily on the law of parties. \nThe court acknowledged that testing results showing \nPedro Gracia\u2019s (the alleged getaway driver\u2019s) DNA in \nthe \nvictim\u2019s \nfingernail \nscrapings \nwould \nbe \n\u201cconceivabl[y] \u2018exculpatory,\u201d but nevertheless held \nthat even if Gutierrez proved that he did not \nparticipate in the assault on Ms. Harrison, there were \nno reasonable grounds for testing under Chapter 64 \nbecause, as one of the parties to the underlying \nburglary, he was still guilty of capital murder. JA \n601a\u2013602a. The court specifically explained why each \npiece of evidence Gutierrez sought to have tested \ncould not show he was not involved in planning the \nburglary and therefore could not exculpate him from \nhis capital murder conviction. See, e.g., JA 602a \n(\u201c[E]xculpatory nail scrapings would not make it less \nprobable that appellant \u2018planned the ripoff\u2019 and was a \nparty to Mrs. Harrison\u2019s murder.\u201d). \nFinally, the court ruled that testing is not \navailable under Chapter 64 to show that a death-\nsentenced prisoner is ineligible for the death penalty, \nand commented that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to \nevidence that might affect the punishment stage as \nwell as conviction, appellant still would not be entitled \nto testing.\u201d JA 602a\u2013603a. The court concluded that \neven with favorable DNA results, \u201cAppellant would \nstill have been death-eligible,\u201d but made clear that it \nbased this conclusion only on the facts in the trial \nrecord. JA 603a (\u201c[T]he record facts satisfy the \nEnmund/Tison culpability requirements.\u201d (emphasis \n\n15 \n \nadded)). The court provided no analysis for this \ncursory conclusion.  \nIn 2015, Gutierrez filed a motion for miscellaneous \nrelief in the trial court, seeking independent DNA \ntesting of potentially exculpatory material under \nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). JA 735a\u2013749a. \nGutierrez explained in detail how exculpatory DNA \nresults would impact his eligibility for the death \npenalty. Specifically, he explained, because the State\u2019s \ntrial theory was that the two men who attacked and \nkilled Ms. Harrison were Rene Garcia and Ruben \nGutierrez, while Pedro Gracia acted as the getaway \ndriver, DNA evidence placing Gracia, but not \nGutierrez, inside the victim\u2019s home would lend critical \nsupport to Gutierrez\u2019s argument \u201cthat he did not plan, \ndid not intend or participate, was not present for, and \ndid not personally participate in the victim\u2019s murder.\u201d \nJA 744a.  \nNotwithstanding the CCA\u2019s prior ruling, the State \ninitially did not oppose the request. The State \nexplained that \u201c[b]ecause of the nature of the \npunishment assessed against the Defendant, and \nfurther because of the nature of the allegations in \nDefendant\u2019s Motion[], the State now will not oppose \nthe request for testing, but neither does the State \nagree to said relief.\u201d JA 732a.  \nIn 2018, however, after the trial court failed to rule \non the motion for over two years, the State moved the \ntrial court to set an execution date for Gutierrez. The \ntrial court granted the State\u2019s request for an execution \ndate and denied Gutierrez\u2019s motion for DNA testing \nthe same day.  \n\n16 \n \nThe 2019 request for DNA testing \nFollowing additional proceedings, newly appointed \ncounsel in 2019 obtained access to files at the \nCameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Counsel \nfiled a new motion for DNA testing. Several factors \ndistinguished this motion from previous efforts: (1) \nTexas had repealed the \u201cno fault\u201d provision of Chapter \n64, eliminating that as a basis for denying testing; (2) \nhabeas counsel located the hair recovered from the \nvictim\u2019s hand, previously thought lost, in a sealed \nenvelope in the District Attorney\u2019s files; and (3) \nadvances in DNA testing now made it possible to \nobtain DNA from degraded samples and \u201ctouch\u201d DNA \nfrom items with which a perpetrator has merely come \ninto contact. JA 662a, 679a, 684a.  \nThe 2019 motion also described additional \nevidence that, considered alongside the anticipated \nDNA results, would cast doubt on Gutierrez\u2019s role as \na principal in the crime and thus his eligibility for the \ndeath penalty. For instance, Gutierrez demonstrated \nthat the lead detective, Det. Garcia, testified falsely in \nseveral important respects. Det. Garcia claimed that \nthe \neyewitnesses \nplaced \nGutierrez \nnear \nMs. \nHarrison\u2019s home \u201caround the time that the pathologist \nestimated the time of death was.\u201d 19 RR 40. In fact, \nthe pathologist did not estimate a time of death at all. \nAnd although the eyewitnesses saw Gutierrez in the \nvicinity of Ms. Harrison\u2019s trailer around 6:00 PM at \nthe latest, the paramedics who responded to the scene \nestimated her time of death as somewhere between \n7:30 and 9:30 PM. Det. Garcia also failed to mention \nthat another witness reported his wife had spoken on \n\n17 \n \nthe phone with Ms. Harrison at about 6:30 PM. JA \n692a\u2013694a. \nDet. Garcia also testified that he showed \neyewitness Veronica Lopez a photo array with \nGutierrez\u2019s photo but she \u201cwas unable to identify \nRuben as having been at the mobile home.\u201d 19 RR 46. \nIn fact, Lopez identified a different person in the photo \narray as the man she saw at the crime scene that day, \nwhich Det. Garcia concealed from the jury. JA 695a. \nThat was not all that Det. Garcia concealed. \nAlthough he had falsely written in his police report \nthat Ms. Harrison\u2019s nephew, Avel Cuellar, had passed \na polygraph exam, the polygraph report in fact \nrevealed \n\u201csignificant \ncriteria\u201d \nthat \n\u201cindicate[d] \ndeception at questions pertaining to the knowledge \nand/or participation in this offense.\u201d JA 704a\u2013706a. \nGutierrez also adduced evidence that, the summer \nbefore the crime, Cuellar approached his own nephew \n(Fermin Cuellar) about stealing \u201ca lot\u201d of money from \nMs. Harrison and that, at some point after she was \nkilled, Cuellar told Fermin that he had money buried \nin the trailer park\u2014and almost $500,000 of Ms. \nHarrison\u2019s money remains unaccounted for. JA 701a. \nThe motion also explained that it was Cuellar, while \n\u201cvisibly shaking\u201d during his interview with the police, \nwho first suggested Gutierrez as a suspect. JA 703a\u2013\n704a. \nThe motion urged that DNA testing could \nimplicate Cuellar in the homicide, thus undermining \nthe State\u2019s theory that Gutierrez and Garcia were in \nthe house. Testing could also show that it was Gracia, \nthe alleged getaway driver, who was in the house with \n\n18 \n \nGarcia, again undermining the State\u2019s theory and \nsupporting the defense that Gutierrez played no role \nin and had no knowledge of the killing. JA 709a\u2013715a. \nNotwithstanding the denials of Gutierrez\u2019s prior \nDNA motions, the trial court initially granted the \n2019 motion. JA 659a. After the State filed an \nobjection, however, the trial court reversed course and \nsigned the State\u2019s proposed order denying DNA \ntesting. JA 655a\u2013658a. The CCA affirmed the denial \nof relief. JA 542a\u2013566a. The court declined to consider \nGutierrez\u2019s additional evidence casting doubt on his \nrole as a principal, holding that the law of parties \nprevented Gutierrez from showing that he would have \nbeen acquitted if exculpatory DNA results had been \nobtained: \n[Gutierrez] conceded that this Court found in \nits opinion on his prior DNA appeal that \nidentity was not an issue in this case. \nHowever, he argued that new evidence \nrequires the Court to re-evaluate this holding. \n. . . [W]e need not determine whether identity \nis an issue in this case because appellant has \nfailed to establish that he would not have \nbeen convicted if exculpatory results had been \nobtained through DNA testing. \nJA 557a. The court again analyzed why each piece of \nevidence would not affect Gutierrez\u2019s party liability. \nSee, e.g., JA 561a (exculpatory fingernail scrapings \n\u201cwould not relieve him of liability as a party in the \ncase\u201d); JA 563a (\u201cAn exculpatory result\u201d as to the hair \n\u201cwould not release appellant from party liability for \nthe offense.\u201d); id. (as to blood samples collected from \n\n19 \n \nthe scene, \u201c[r]egardless of whose DNA . . . is found in \nthese samples, no result would release appellant from \nparty liability for the offense\u201d). \nThe court then reiterated that testing is not \navailable under Chapter 64 to show ineligibility for \nthe death penalty and quoted its prior opinion \nverbatim that, \u201ceven if Chapter 64 did apply to \nevidence that might affect the punishment stage,\u201d \nGutierrez \u201cwould still have been death-eligible \nbecause the record facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison \nculpability requirements.\u201d JA 564a\u2013565a (emphasis \nadded). The court did not address what effect the \nadditional evidence would have on any future attack \non Gutierrez\u2019s death eligibility.  \nSection 1983 proceedings \nOn April 22, 2020, Gutierrez filed an amended \ncomplaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the district court. \nThe complaint challenged the constitutionality of \nTexas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedures, as \nwell as the constitutionality of Texas\u2019s execution \nprotocol, which at the time did not allow a spiritual \nadvisor to be in the execution chamber. JA 427a\u2013466a.  \nFollowing a stay of execution and a remand from \nthis Court on the spiritual advisor claim, see Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. 1260, 1261 (2021), the district \ncourt issued a partial declaratory judgment in \nGutierrez\u2019s favor on the DNA challenge. JA 23a\u201362a. \nAlthough the district court rejected many of \nGutierrez\u2019s claims, it concluded that Chapter 64 \nviolated Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights in one \nsignificant respect. The district court observed that \nChapter 64 has been construed as allowing DNA \n\n20 \n \ntesting only to establish innocence of a crime, not \nineligibility for the death penalty. JA 56a. At the same \ntime, however, Article 11.071, Section 5(a)(3), of the \nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure grants death-\nsentenced prisoners the substantive right to file a \nsuccessive post-conviction petition challenging their \neligibility for the death penalty. JA 56a\u201357a. \nSpecifically, section 5(a)(3) provides an avenue for \nsubsequent \nhabeas \nrelief \nwhere \nan \napplicant \ndemonstrates \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, but \nfor a violation of the United States Constitution no \nrational juror would have answered in the state\u2019s \nfavor one or more of the special issues that were \nsubmitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s trial.\u201d To \nobtain merits review of a claim under section 5(a)(3), \nan applicant need make only \u201ca threshold showing\u201d of \nevidence sufficient to support the ultimate conclusion \nthat the applicant is ineligible for the death penalty. \nEx Parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 163 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2007). \nThe district court cited this Court\u2019s recognition \nthat \u201c[a] process which amounts to a \u2018meaningless \nritual\u2019 is historically and contemporarily disproved of \nby the courts.\u201d JA 59a (citing Douglas v. People of \nState of Cal., 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963); Burns v. \nUnited States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991); Griffin v. \nIllinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956)). Granting the right to \na successive habeas petition to show ineligibility for \nthe death penalty while denying access to the \nevidence that could vindicate that right was found to \nbe such an empty ritual. Accordingly, the district \ncourt held that Chapter 64, as construed by the CCA, \n\n21 \n \nviolated due process, JA 60a, and granted declaratory \nrelief, JA 61a.  \nThe 2021 request for DNA testing \nFollowing the district court\u2019s ruling and based on \nthe declaratory judgment, Gutierrez again filed a \nmotion pursuant to Chapter 64 in state court seeking \nDNA testing to establish his ineligibility for the death \npenalty. In response, the State asked the state court \nto dismiss Gutierrez\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction. \nJA 607a\u2013615a. The State took the position that \n\u201c[b]ecause the federal district court declared Article \n64.03 to be unconstitutional, . . . there was no longer \nany legitimate statutory authority for DNA testing at \nall.\u201d JA 485a. The State further contended that the \nfederal court\u2019s judgment declaring Chapter 64 \nunconstitutional was \u201cthe law of the case and . . . \nbinding on all other courts,\u201d and that the court \ntherefore lacked jurisdiction to consider Gutierrez\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion. JA 613a\u2013614a (emphasis in \noriginal). The trial court granted the State\u2019s plea to \njurisdiction and denied the motion. JA 606a. \nOn appeal, the CCA reversed the lower court\u2019s \nfinding of no jurisdiction and remanded, concluding \nthat the federal district court\u2019s ruling did not \u201cdivest[] \nthe convicting court in this case of its statutory \njurisdiction to determine whether Appellant is \nentitled to the DNA testing he seeks.\u201d JA 487a. On \nremand, the trial court ruled that the motion was \ncollaterally estopped and barred by the doctrines of \nres judicata and law of the case. JA 605a. The CCA \naffirmed on appeal, quoting verbatim its 2011 opinion \nthat \u201cAppellant would still have been death-eligible \n\n22 \n \nbecause the record facts satisfy the Enmund/Tison \nculpability requirements.\u201d JA 478a (emphasis added). \nThe State\u2019s appeal of the district court \njudgment \nIn the \u00a7 1983 litigation, the federal district court \ngranted the State\u2019s motion for partial final judgment \non the DNA claims. JA 63a\u201371a. The State appealed, \nand this Court issued its opinion in Reed while the \nappeal was pending.  \nOn appeal, the State raised for the first time the \nredressability argument at issue here. Specifically, \nthe State argued that a federal court declaratory \njudgment in Gutierrez\u2019s favor would not likely cause \nthe prosecutor in this case to agree to DNA testing, in \nlight of the CCA\u2019s prior conclusion that Gutierrez \ncould not establish his ineligibility for the death \npenalty even with favorable DNA results. JA 12a.  \nA divided panel of the Fifth Circuit accepted the \nState\u2019s argument, reversing the district court\u2019s \njudgment and holding that Gutierrez lacks standing. \nJA 3a\u201322a. The panel majority grafted onto Reed an \nadditional layer of standing analysis, scouring the \nstate court record and speculating that Gutierrez\u2019s \ninjury could not be redressed because the CCA \u201chas \nalready found that Gutierrez would have no right to \nDNA testing even if the statutory bar to testing for \nevidence \nabout \nsentencing \nwere \nheld \nto \nbe \nunconstitutional.\u201d JA 18a.  \nThe panel majority recognized that it went well \nbeyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt \ngives us some pause that the Supreme Court in Reed \ndid not mention examining the state court\u2019s decision \n\n23 \n \nfor whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely \nactions . . . .\u201d JA 16a\u201317a n.3. The majority justified \nits departure from Reed based on the principle that \n\u201c[q]uestions which merely lurk in the record, neither \nbrought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, \nare not to be considered as having been so decided.\u201d \nId. (quoting Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 419 \nn.3 (5th Cir. 2019)).  \nJudge Higginson dissented, observing that Reed \ndictates that Gutierrez has standing:  \nInstead of conducting a fact-specific inquiry \nand delving into what District Attorney \nGoertz \nhimself \nwould \ndo, \nthe \nCourt \ndetermined that a declaratory judgment \ninvalidating Texas\u2019s DNA testing procedure \nwould significantly increase the likelihood \nthat the state prosecutor would grant access \nto the requested DNA testing. Because the \nstanding analysis of Reed applies here, \nGutierrez, also facing execution, has standing \nto bring suit. \nJA 21a\u201322a. After the Fifth Circuit denied rehearing, \nGutierrez sought a stay of execution pending review \nin this Court. This Court granted a stay and \nsubsequently granted certiorari. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn Reed, this Court determined that a prisoner has \nArticle III standing to bring a constitutional challenge \nto state DNA statutes that limit access to potentially \nexculpatory evidence. In its decision, the Court stated \nthe elements that were sufficient to establish Reed\u2019s \nstanding: \n\n24 \n \nReed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: \ndenial of access to the evidence. The state \nprosecutor, who is the named defendant, \ndenied access to the evidence and thereby \ncaused Reed\u2019s injury. And if a federal court \nconcludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA \ntesting procedures violate due process, that \ncourt order would eliminate the state \nprosecutor\u2019s justification for denying DNA \ntesting. It is \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that the \nstate prosecutor would abide by such a court \norder. \nId. at 234 (quoting Evans, 536 U.S. at 464).  \nPetitioner Ruben Gutierrez sought such a \ndeclaratory judgment in the same manner as Rodney \nReed had. Like Reed, Gutierrez is a death-sentenced \nprisoner, and he sought and was denied access to \nconduct DNA testing on the prosecution\u2019s evidence. \nBoth men sued the custodians of the evidence under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, arguing that Texas\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute violated due process.  \nReed should have controlled the question of \nstanding. But the majority below instead concluded \nthat Gutierrez lacked standing because it was not \n\u201clikely\u201d that Respondents would permit DNA testing \neven if a federal court declared unconstitutional the \nstatutory basis of Respondents\u2019 refusal. JA 19a \n(emphasis in original). The panel majority premised \nthat prediction on an earlier CCA decision stating \nthat even favorable DNA test results would not prove \nGutierrez ineligible for the death penalty in light of \nother evidence in the trial record. JA 14a\u201320a. \n\n25 \n \nTherefore, the majority concluded, Gutierrez could not \nmeet the redressability prong of Article III standing. \nJA 19a\u201320a.  \nThe ruling below is wrong because the CCA \ndecision does not deprive Gutierrez of standing to \npursue his claim in federal court.   \nI.A.  The Fifth Circuit was wrong when it premised \nstanding on a prediction about what the state \nRespondents would do in the event that a declaration \nwere entered against them. What matters is that \nRespondents are capable of providing relief in \naccordance with the declaration. To be sure, \nRespondents might well argue in a subsequent state \nproceeding that even favorable DNA evidence would \nnot entitle Gutierrez to state habeas relief, but \nRespondents would not be compelled to make that \nargument.  Respondents are wholly capable of \nredressing Gutierrez\u2019s procedural injury by providing \nhim access to the evidence he seeks. That is enough to \nestablish standing. And to the extent the majority \nbelow held that Gutierrez lacked standing simply \nbecause Respondents would not permit DNA testing, \nthat wrongly allows standing to be determined by a \ndefendant\u2019s recalcitrance. Because Respondents are \ncapable of redressing Gutierrez\u2019s due process injury \nand are more likely to do so in the face of a declaratory \njudgment, it was error for the court below to hold that \nhis injury was not redressable. \n \nI.B.  As this Court has explained many times, a \nlitigant bringing a due process claim does not need to \nestablish that he will prevail on the merits of his \nsubstantive claim in order to have standing to pursue \n\n26 \n \nthe procedural claim. All that is required\u2014at most\u2014\nis that the litigant have some chance of prevailing on \nthe substantive claim, which is to say that the claim \nwould be \u201copen to some dispute,\u201d Fuentes, 407 U.S. at \n87 n.17, or that \u201cthere remains at least the possibility\u201d \nof relief, Center for Biological Diversity v. EPA, 861 \nF.3d 174, 185 (D.C. Cir. 2017), even if the court \u201cmight \nwell come\u201d to an adverse decision, Brown, 600 U.S. at \n561\u201362. Reed itself illustrates this principle well. Reed \ndid not inquire into the merits of Reed\u2019s state habeas \nclaim to determine if he had standing to seek a \ndeclaratory judgment. Because the defendant state \nactors were capable of providing access to the DNA, a \ndeclaration would \u201corder[] a change in a legal status\u201d \nbetween the parties. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. \nII.  The panel\u2019s decision is also wrong in \nconcluding that Gutierrez lacked standing because \nthe CCA already stated that favorable DNA evidence \nwould not be sufficient to undermine his death \neligibility. \nThe \nCCA \nmade \nthat \nhypothetical \nassessment by comparing potential DNA evidence \nagainst the trial record. But Gutierrez would present \nto the CCA any favorable DNA evidence in \nconjunction with other exculpatory evidence proffered \nafter the trial, including evidence that the lead \ndetective on the case gave false testimony and that \nAvel Cuellar masterminded the underlying felony. No \ncourt, including the CCA, has ever assessed whether \nthat evidence, in conjunction with favorable DNA \nevidence, would support a death-ineligibility claim on \na successive state habeas petition. This Court need \nnot and should not assess whether this evidence \nwould entitle Gutierrez to relief under state law. It is \n\n27 \n \nsufficient for Gutierrez\u2019s standing in his \u00a7 1983 action \nthat he could prevail with the benefit of the DNA \nevidence. This Court should reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nspeculative approach to standing, which ignores \nRespondents\u2019 ability to unilaterally agree to testing \nand rests on a predictive judgment of what a state \ncourt would do in a hypothetical future proceeding.  \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONER \nHAS \nSTANDING \nUNDER \nREED. \nReed did not scour the state court proceedings to \npredict what District Attorney Goertz might do \nfollowing a declaratory judgment in Reed\u2019s favor. Nor \ndid it examine the state court opinions to determine \nhow DNA evidence might or might not ultimately \naffect the outcome of future proceedings. In premising \nits standing analysis on such predictions, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s opinion cannot be reconciled with Reed.  \nA. \nGutierrez Has Standing to Bring His \n\u00a7 1983 Claim Under the Standard This \nCourt Applied in Reed.  \nThe requirement of standing serves to limit federal \njurisdiction to \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies\u201d under \nArticle III. Association of Data Processing Service \nOrgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 151 (1970). To establish \nstanding, a plaintiff must show that (i) he has suffered \nan injury in fact, (ii) the injury likely was caused by \nthe defendant, and (iii) the injury likely would be \nredressed by the requested judicial relief. See Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). \nThe \nredressability \nrequirement, \nin \nparticular, \nenforces Article III\u2019s prohibition against \u201cadvisory \n\n28 \n \nopinion[s] without the possibility of any judicial \nrelief.\u201d California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 673 (2021) \n(quoting City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 129 \n(1983) (Marshall, J., dissenting)). \nJust last year, this Court held in Reed that a \ncapital defendant had standing to bring a \u00a7 1983 claim \nalleging that Texas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing \nprocedures violated due process. 598 U.S. at 234. As \nthis Court explained, Reed \u201csufficiently alleged an \ninjury in fact: denial of access to the requested \nevidence\u201d and properly brought the suit against the \nstate prosecutor who \u201cdenied access to the evidence \nand thereby caused Reed\u2019s injury.\u201d Id. As this Court \nfurther explained, a court \u201cconclud[ing] that Texas\u2019s \npost-conviction DNA testing procedures violate due \nprocess\u201d would lead to a \u201c\u2018significant increase in the \nlikelihood\u2019 that the state prosecutor would grant \naccess to the requested evidence and that Reed \ntherefore \u2018would obtain relief that directly redresses \nthe injury suffered.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Evans, 536 U.S. at \n464).  \nSo too in this case.  \nFirst, as was true in Reed, the basis of Gutierrez\u2019s \n\u00a7 1983 claim is that he suffered an injury in fact: \n\u201cdenial of access to the requested [DNA] evidence.\u201d Id. \nSecond, like Reed, Gutierrez filed suit against the \nappropriate local prosecutor. Third, as in Reed, the \ndeclaratory judgment that Gutierrez seeks would \n\u201corder[] a change in a legal status\u201d of the parties and \nthus \u201camount to a significant increase in the \nlikelihood that the state local prosecutor would grant \naccess to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. (quoting Evans, \n\n29 \n \n536 U.S. at 464); cf. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293 (2023) (declaratory judgment has no such \neffect on non-parties and is \u201clittle more than an \nadvisory opinion\u201d). \nReed is entirely consistent with this Court\u2019s \nprecedents concerning redressability in the context of \ndeclaratory judgments. Just as the federal courts have \n\u201cwithout deviation\u201d refused to issue advisory opinions \nthroughout our history, see Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n83, 96, 96 n.14 (1968) (noting Chief Justice Jay\u2019s \ncorrespondence \nwith \nPresident \nWashington), \na \ndeclaratory judgment must \u201csettl[e] . . . some dispute \nwhich affects the behavior of the defendant towards the \nplaintiff.\u201d Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761 (1987) \n(emphasis in original). A declaratory judgment can \nredress an injury notwithstanding that \u201cit is a much \nmilder form of relief than an injunction.\u201d Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 471 (1974) (quotation \nomitted). It has \u201cthe force and effect of a final \njudgment\u201d even though its force \u201cmay be persuasive\u201d \nrather than \u201cultimately coercive,\u201d and even though a \nparty\u2019s noncompliance \u201cmay be inappropriate, but is \nnot contempt.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). \nA \ncourt \nmay \ngrant \ndeclaratory \nrelief, \nso \nunderstood, against a government official, even when \ndamages and an injunction are unavailable. In \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992), the \nCourt found it \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that the \nPresident and various officials \u201cwould abide by an \nauthoritative interpretation of the census statute and \nconstitutional provision by the District Court, even \nthough they would not be directly bound by such a \ndetermination.\u201d Id. at 803 (plurality opinion). The \n\n30 \n \nCourt adopted the same reasoning in Evans, \nconcluding \nthat \nthe \ndefendant-officials \nwere \n\u201csubstantially likely\u201d to comply with a declaratory \njudgment \nwhen \nconducting \nthe \ncensus \nand \napportioning congressional seats, such that a \ndeclaratory judgment \u201cwould amount to a significant \nincrease in the likelihood that the plaintiff would \nobtain relief that directly redresses the injury \nsuffered.\u201d 536 U.S. at 463\u201364. Reed relied on the \nparallel \nassumption \nthat \nstate \nofficials \nwere \n\u201csubstantially likely\u201d to comply with federal law as \ndeclared by a federal court. 598 U.S. at 234 (quoting \nEvans, 536 U.S. at 464). That assumption is sound, \nbecause state prosecutors\u2019 decisions are accorded the \nsame \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d that extends to \nthose of federal officials. Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S. \n391, 400 (2019). \nThe ruling below departs from these settled \nprinciples. The Fifth Circuit majority held that \nGutierrez does not have standing because a \ndeclaratory judgment in his favor was not \u201clikely\u201d to \n\u201ccause the prosecutor to order DNA testing.\u201d JA 19a\u2013\n20a (emphasis in original). Texas made precisely the \nsame argument in Reed, and this Court rejected it out \nof hand. Resp\u2019t Br. at 38\u201339, Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230 (2023) (stating that \u201cthe relief Reed seeks would \nnot require any change in conduct from district \nattorney Goertz, nor is it likely to bring about such \nchange\u201d). Standing does not turn on whether the \ndefendant represents that he will comply with a court \norder\u2014that \nwould \nallow \nobstinacy \nto \ndefeat \nstanding\u2014but on whether a favorable result would \n\u201corder[] a change in [the] legal status\u201d between the \n\n31 \n \nparties. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. In \u201cterms of . . . \n\u2018standing\u2019 precedent,\u201d \u201cthe practical consequence of \nthat change would amount to a significant increase in \nthe likelihood that the state prosecutor would grant \naccess to the requested evidence.\u201d Id. (some internal \nquotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit majority\u2019s \ntest would allow a state actor to foreclose declaratory \nrelief, and defeat standing, simply by pledging non-\ncompliance. That view of standing is no more correct \nhere than it was in Reed. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority \nconcluded \nthat \nGutierrez lacked standing because the CCA \u201chas \nalready found that [he] would have no right to DNA \ntesting even if the statutory bar to testing for evidence \nabout sentencing were held to be unconstitutional.\u201d \nJA 18a. According to the Fifth Circuit, \u201cReed is \nproperly distinguished\u201d because in Gutierrez\u2019s case, if \n\u201cthe limitation on DNA testing for evidence relevant \nonly to conviction [were held] invalid, the facts in the \ntrial record would prevent [him] from receiving the \nDNA testing because such evidence could not change \nthe fact that he was death-eligible.\u201d Id. This \nconclusion is irreconcilable with Reed, which did not \ncondition redressability on the ultimate success or \nfailure of the prisoner\u2019s future litigation.  \nB. \nReed\u2019s Holding Is Consistent with \nThis \nCourt\u2019s \nTreatment \nof \nDue \nProcess \nand \nProcedural \nRights \nClaims, Which Applies Equally Here.  \nIf followed in other remedial contexts, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nspeculative \ncompliance-prediction \nrequirement would call into question broad categories \n\n32 \n \nof this Court\u2019s precedents. Reed was consistent with \nthose precedents. The ruling below is not. \n1. \nA \ndue \nprocess \nviolation \nis \nredressed by observance of the \nrequired procedure, regardless \nof whether the cured procedure \nwill yield a different substantive \nresult. \nAside from its misreading of Reed, the ruling below \nmisapprehends the due process violation at issue, \nwhich protects the right to develop and assert a \nstatutory claim rather than to prevail on it. \u201cThe \nfundamental requisite of due process of law is the \nopportunity to be heard.\u201d Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. \n385, 394 (1914). As the district court explained in its \ndeclaratory judgment order, Chapter 64 violates due \nprocess because it forecloses a post-conviction \nproceeding that the State otherwise purports to \nprovide. JA 58a\u201359a. On the one hand, Texas law \nallows a death-sentenced prisoner to bring a \nsuccessive habeas corpus claim that he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty. JA 59a\u201360a. On the other, Chapter \n64 \u201cbarricades the primary avenue for him to make \nuse of that right.\u201d Id. Chapter 64 makes the post-\nconviction remedy \u201cillusory\u201d by extinguishing a claim \nbefore Gutierrez and those similarly situated can even \nbring it. JA 59a.  \nIn ruling that a declaratory judgment does not \ncure the infirmity, the Fifth Circuit relied on the \n\u201cearlier Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific \nviolation.\u201d JA 15a\u201316a. Gutierrez has not been \n\n33 \n \ninjured, the Fifth Circuit explained, because the CCA \nhas already found him unable to obtain DNA testing \nunder a hypothetically amended version of Chapter 64 \nthat would allow testing to challenge the prisoner\u2019s \ndeath eligibility. But those determinations by the \nCCA do not embrace the sentencing claim that \nGutierrez seeks to develop and present, see Argument \nII, infra, and that the district court held was \n\u201cbarricaded\u201d by the limitations of Chapter 64. The \nCCA opined that DNA results alone would not \nundermine the \u201crecord facts\u201d from trial that allowed \nthe jury to find him death eligible. JA 564a\u2013565a. It \nexpressly declined to consider additional non-DNA \nevidence calling into question the underlying \u201crecord \nfacts,\u201d and thus, the state courts have not reviewed \nthe broader and eventual death-eligibility claim that \nRespondents continue to stifle. JA 557a. \nMore fundamentally, the violation here is to \nGutierrez\u2019s right to be heard, that is, his right to \ndevelop and assert his death-eligibility claim, \nregardless of the probability that a state court will \nultimately sustain that claim. Because Gutierrez\u2019s \nconstitutional injury does not depend on the eventual \nmerits of his eventual claim, Respondents would cure \nthat injury, and allow Gutierrez to be heard, by \ngranting him access to the evidence needed to make a \nsuccessive claim against his sentence. \u201c[A] plaintiff \nsatisfies the redressability requirement when he \nshows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete \ninjury to himself.\u201d Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, \n243 n.15 (1982). \u201cHe need not show that a favorable \ndecision will relieve his every injury.\u201d Id. \n\n34 \n \nThis Court\u2019s precedents illustrate that a claim of \nconstitutionally defective process does not require \nproof of factually winning substance. An owner of \nchattels is entitled to a hearing before a sheriff seizes \nthe property by replevin. Fuentes, 407 U.S. at 83\u201384. \nIt is \u201cimmaterial\u201d whether the owner is behind on \ninstallment payments and has \u201cno other valid \ndefenses\u201d to the creditors\u2019 claims, at least when \u201cthe \nright to continued possession of the goods was open to \nsome dispute at a hearing.\u201d Id. at 87, 87 n.17. \nSimilarly, a default judgment entered without notice \nand a hearing must be set aside, regardless of whether \nthe defendant had a meritorious defense. Peralta, 485 \nU.S. at 86\u201387.  \nThe violation at issue here undermines Gutierrez\u2019s \nright to pursue a state remedy rather than to win \nresentencing under that remedy. Respondents can \nredress the violation by allowing access to the \nevidence that they continue to \u201cbarricade\u201d under color \nof state law. JA 59a\u201360a. It does not matter whether \nRespondents share the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view on \nGutierrez\u2019s prospects for relief. \n2. \nA procedural rights violation is \nredressed \nby \nobservance \nof \nrequired procedures, regardless \nof whether the substantive result \nwill be altered. \nThe Court\u2019s logic in procedural due process cases \nmirrors its approach in cases involving other \nprocedural rights, including those litigated under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551\u2013559. \nIn this context too, \u201c\u2018procedural rights\u2019 are special: \n\n35 \n \nThe person who has been accorded a procedural right \nto protect his concrete interests can assert that right \nwithout meeting all the normal standards for \nredressability and immediacy.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 \nn.7. By way of example, Justice Scalia explained, a \nperson living adjacent to a proposed site for a federally \nlicensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing \nagency\u2019s failure to prepare an environmental impact \nstatement \u201ceven though he cannot establish with any \ncertainty that the statement will cause the license to \nbe withheld or altered, and even though the dam will \nnot be completed for many years.\u201d Id.  \nIn other words, a litigant who has suffered a \nprocedural injury has standing \u201ceven though the \nagency (like a new jury after a mistrial) might later, \nin the exercise of its lawful discretion, reach the same \nresult for a different reason.\u201d FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. \n11, 25 (1998); see also, e.g., Clark Cnty., Nev. v. F.A.A., \n522 F.3d 437, 440 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(argument against plaintiff-county\u2019s standing was \n\u201cmeritless\u201d because the FAA on remand \u201ccould issue \nhazard \ndeterminations \nthat \nwould \nprevent \nconstruction\u201d of wind turbines near the county\u2019s \nplanned \nairport) \n(emphasis \nadded); \nBiological \nDiversity, 861 F.3d at 185 (holding that the EPA could \nreach a different conclusion \u201cnotwithstanding the \nEPA\u2019s assertion that a \u2018serious possibility\u2019 exists that \nthe . . . order would remain unchanged\u201d). \nThe \u201cprocedural injury\u201d framework illuminates \nGutierrez\u2019s standing in this case. Here, Article 11.071 \n\u00a7 5(a)(3) provides prisoners a procedural right to \nprotect their concrete interest in seeking relief from \ntheir death sentences, but Chapter 64 \u201cbarricades\u201d \n\n36 \n \nGutierrez from obtaining access to the very evidence \nneeded to seek such relief. JA 59a\u201360a. The question \nis not whether Gutierrez will be ultimately successful \nin obtaining DNA testing, or, one step further, \nwhether he will be successful in vacating his death \nsentence based on the testing. The more apt question \nis whether a favorable judgment may cause \nRespondents to \u201crevisit[]\u201d their decision, and thus \nwhether \u201cthere remains at least the possibility that \n[they] could reach a different conclusion.\u201d Biological \nDiversity, 861 F.3d at 185. \nMore generally, \u201c[a] plaintiff who alleges a \ndeprivation of a procedural protection to which he is \nentitled never has to prove that if he had received the \nprocedure the substantive result would have been \naltered.\u201d Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Fla. v. \nVeneman, 289 F.3d 89, 94 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \u201cAll that is \nnecessary is to show that the procedural step was \nconnected to the substantive result.\u201d Id. at 94\u201395. \nGutierrez meets that threshold. Chapter 64\u2019s \nrestrictive procedures are directly connected to \nGutierrez\u2019s inability to procure DNA evidence upon \nwhich to pursue post-conviction relief. Gutierrez has \nstanding to seek a declaratory judgment redressing \nthat defect. \n\n37 \n \nII. THE \nFIFTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nATTEMPT \nTO \nDISTINGUISH REED MISREADS THE CCA\u2019S \nDECISIONS AS STRICTLY PRECLUDING \nDNA TESTING AS WELL AS ANY FUTURE \nDEATH-ELIGIBILITY CLAIM BASED ON \nSUCH TESTING. \nAside from being inconsistent with Reed\u2019s \nstraightforward \nanalysis, \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nconclusion about the preclusive effect of the CCA\u2019s \nprior opinions erroneously conditions federal standing \non issues of state law\u2014issues that the Fifth Circuit \ngot fundamentally wrong here. The history of this case \nevinces ample evidence that Respondents could agree \nto testing in light of a declaratory judgment. \nMoreover, the CCA opinions simply do not create the \nbarriers that the Fifth Circuit ascribed to them.  \nThe operative actors here are Respondents, not the \nCCA, and the CCA\u2019s prior opinions do not preclude \nRespondents from granting access to the evidence \nGutierrez seeks. For instance, in Skinner v. State, No. \nAP\u201376,675, 2012 WL 2343616, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. \nJune 20, 2012), the State of Texas agreed to DNA \ntesting on Skinner\u2019s third Chapter 64 motion even \nafter the CCA had denied his first two motions.  \nEven in this case, the CCA\u2019s prior rulings have not \ndictated Respondents\u2019 position on DNA testing. In \nresponse to Gutierrez\u2019s 2015 Motion for Miscellaneous \nRelief, Respondent Saenz did not oppose Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequest for DNA testing to establish ineligibility for \nthe death penalty, notwithstanding the CCA\u2019s prior \nopinion that Chapter 64 does not permit testing for \nthat purpose and that, even if it did, Gutierrez would \n\n38 \n \nnot be able to make such a showing. See JA 731a\u2013\n732a. Respondent Saenz explained that, \u201c[b]ecause of \nthe nature of the punishment assessed against the \nDefendant, and further because of the nature of the \nallegations in Defendant\u2019s Motion[], the State now \nwill not oppose the request for testing.\u201d Id.  \nSimilarly, the state trial court initially granted \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion for DNA testing despite the \nCCA\u2019s prior opinion, only to reverse course when \nRespondent Saenz stated his opposition. JA 655a\u2013\n659a. And as for the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Respondent Saenz previously took the \nposition that it was \u201cthe law of the case\u201d and \n\u201cbinding.\u201d JA 613a\u2013614a (emphasis in original). Thus, \neven if it were appropriate for courts to consider what \nan individual state actor might do in response to a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, the history of \nthis case establishes that what the CCA has \npreviously said does not preclude Respondents from \ngranting access to the requested evidence, or even \nmake it all that unlikely. \nRegardless, the CCA\u2019s opinions on Gutierrez\u2019s \nprior Chapter 64 motions are not preclusive as to \nwhether, armed with exculpatory DNA testing \nresults, he could raise a colorable claim of death \nineligibility in a successive habeas application under \nArticle 11.071, section 5(a)(3). That statute provides \nan avenue for subsequent habeas relief where an \napplicant demonstrates \u201cby clear and convincing \nevidence, but for a violation of the United States \nConstitution no rational juror would have answered \nin the state\u2019s favor one or more of the special issues \nthat were submitted to the jury in the applicant\u2019s \n\n39 \n \ntrial.\u201d Moreover, to have a subsequent claim of \ninnocence of the death penalty considered on the \nmerits under section 5(a)(3), an applicant need make \nonly \u201ca threshold showing\u201d of evidence sufficient to \nsupport the ultimate conclusion that the applicant is \nineligible for the death penalty. Ex Parte Blue, 230 \nS.W.3d at 163 (emphasis in original).  \nFavorable DNA results, combined with additional \nevidence no court has ever considered, would allow \nGutierrez to make this threshold showing that he did \nnot \u201cintend[] to kill the deceased or . . . anticipate[] \nthat a human life would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. \nProc. Ann. art. 37.071 \u00a7 2(b)(2). In support of his 2019 \nChapter 64 motion, Gutierrez adduced additional \nfacts that significantly undermined the State\u2019s trial \ntheory that he acted as a principal in Ms. Harrison\u2019s \nmurder. Gutierrez presented evidence that the lead \ndetective had lied about the decedent\u2019s time of death \nto place Gutierrez at the scene at the time of her \nmurder. The detective also lied when he said that Avel \nCuellar\u2014the State\u2019s primary witness and potential \nsuspect in the killing\u2014passed a lie detector test that \nhe actually failed. The same detective hid evidence \nfrom the jury that an eyewitness had actually \nidentified another man as the suspect. Gutierrez also \nadduced evidence that Cuellar had approached his \nnephew about stealing \u201ca lot\u201d of money from his aunt \nshortly before she was killed and had told the same \nnephew after she died that he had money buried in \nthe trailer park. JA 692a\u2013706a. \nThe CCA made clear that it did not consider any of \nthis additional evidence in reaching its conclusion \nthat Gutierrez could not establish death ineligibility \n\n40 \n \nunder Enmund/Tison with exculpatory DNA results. \nSee JA 557a. Indeed, its opinions upholding denial of \nthe 2019 and 2021 DNA motions merely quoted its \n2011 opinion, which long preceded Gutierrez\u2019s proffer \nof the additional evidence. See JA 477a\u2013479a; JA \n564a\u2013565a; JA 602a\u2013603a. Each time the CCA \naddressed \nthe \nissue, \nit \nexpressly \nconsidered \nGutierrez\u2019s death eligibility only in light of \u201cthe record \nfacts.\u201d JA 478a, 565a, 603a (Gutierrez \u201cwould still \nhave been death-eligible because the record facts \nsatisfy the Enmund/Tison culpability requirements\u201d \n(emphasis added)). The CCA similarly explained that \nit \u201cneed not\u201d consider the additional evidence with \nrespect to Gutierrez\u2019s conviction because it would not \nundermine his liability as a party. JA 557a. The Fifth \nCircuit thus acknowledged that the CCA\u2019s opinions \naddressed only \u201cthe facts in the trial record.\u201d JA 19a.  \nUnlike the CCA\u2019s assessment of \u201cthe facts in the \ntrial record\u201d under Chapter 64, a viable claim of \nineligibility for the death penalty in a successive \nhabeas application under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. \nart. 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3) would not be limited to the \nevidence presented at trial. Quite the opposite, section \n5(a) is expressly designed to permit judicial \nconsideration of new facts. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. \nAnn. art. 11.071 \u00a7 5(a). In combination with \nexculpatory DNA results, Gutierrez\u2019s additional \nevidence would present a viable claim of ineligibility \nfor the death penalty. \nThat is because, under both Texas and federal law, \nparty liability is not sufficient for death eligibility, \nwhich requires personal culpability. Johnson, 853 \nS.W.2d at 535; see also Tison, 481 U.S. at 158. Here, \n\n41 \n \nDNA evidence could establish that the two assailants \nwere Garcia and Gracia, or that the assailants were \nCuellar and either Garcia or Gracia. Such DNA \nresults, in tandem with the additional evidence that \nthe CCA has never considered, would alter the picture \nof Gutierrez\u2019s death eligibility. For instance, if DNA \nunder the decedent\u2019s fingernails came from Cuellar, \nthis evidence\u2014combined with evidence that Cuellar \npropositioned his nephew to rob Ms. Harrison shortly \nbefore she was robbed and killed and then later lied to \npolice when denying his involvement during a \npolygraph examination\u2014would severely undercut the \ntrial prosecution\u2019s theory that Gutierrez was present \nduring the murder and masterminded the plot. Such \nevidence would also be considered alongside the \nfalsity of Det. Garcia\u2019s trial testimony placing \nGutierrez at the scene \u201caround . . . the time of death.\u201d \n19 RR 40. As for DNA testing results identifying \ncodefendant Pedro Gracia\u2019s hair wrapped around Ms. \nHarrison\u2019s finger or his biological material under her \nfingernails, the CCA itself acknowledged such \nevidence would be \u201cexculpatory\u201d but merely found \nthat this scenario was \u201cimplausible.\u201d JA 601a\u2013602a.  \nThe totality of DNA and non-DNA evidence would \nchallenge not only whether Gutierrez \u201cintended to kill \nthe deceased or that he anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken,\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 37.071 \n\u00a7 2(b)(2), but also whether his conduct amounted to \n\u201cmajor participation in the felony committed.\u201d Tison, \n481 U.S. at 158. Evidence that Cuellar had proposed \nthe burglary to his own nephew and buried the money \nstolen in the crime, and that testimony placing \nGutierrez at the scene near the time of the murder \n\n42 \n \nwas fabricated, indicates that Gutierrez was not a \n\u201cmajor\u201d participant as required for Tison culpability. \nThe CCA has never considered the impact that the \ntotality of exculpatory DNA evidence, alongside \nadditional evidence undermining the prosecution\u2019s \ntheory, would have on Gutierrez\u2019s death eligibility. \nCertainly such evidence would present an entirely \ndifferent evidentiary landscape from the \u201crecord facts\u201d \nthat the CCA considered in disposing of his Chapter \n64 appeals. The Fifth Circuit treated the CCA\u2019s \nremark as preclusive as to whether Gutierrez would \never be able to obtain any relief, but an appellate \ndetermination of a defendant\u2019s death eligibility is not \nfixed for all time irrespective of changed evidence. \nWere the Fifth Circuit correct, section 5(a)(3) would be \nmeaningless. But in Ex parte Milam, No. WR-79,322-\n04, 2021 WL 197088, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 15, \n2021), for instance, the CCA found Milam had \nsatisfied section 5(a)(3c)\u2019s gateway to merits review of \nhis intellectual disability claim despite having \npreviously denied a claim that he was intellectually \ndisabled. \nThe Fifth Circuit thus placed undue reliance on \nthe CCA\u2019s rulings. This error may have been due in \npart to the absence of formal briefing in the Fifth \nCircuit addressing either Reed or the circuit\u2019s new \nstanding inquiry. But any court applying the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s test in the future would be encumbered by \nsimilarly nuanced questions of state law. That \napproach would both invite similar errors as a matter \nof course and distract from the principles of federal \nlaw upon which Article III standing should rightly \ndepend, see Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. \n\n43 \n \n797, 804 (1985), and under which Gutierrez has \nstanding to bring the declaratory judgment claim that \nthe district court sustained. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below and \nremand for further proceedings. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted,  \n \nLISA EVANS LEWIS \n   Chief Federal Defender  \nANNE ELIZABETH FISHER \n  Counsel of Record \nJOSEPH W.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of no specific knowledge about the legal facts, precedents, or arguments in *Gutierrez v. Saenz*. I knew only the basic case summary and the legal question presented.\n\nBased on the new observation, my understanding has been refined and structured. I now recognize that the central, dispositive issue before the Supreme Court is the procedural doctrine of **Article III standing**. My prediction will hinge on how the Court resolves this threshold question, rather than the underlying merits of Gutierrez's due process claim.\n\nMy analysis will focus on two key components of standing that are at the heart of this dispute:\n1.  **Injury-in-Fact:** I must determine how the petitioner, Gutierrez, defines his injury. Is the injury the denial of access to DNA evidence itself? Or is it the foreclosure of a potential state habeas claim (under Article 11.071) for which the DNA evidence is a necessary predicate? The petitioner must demonstrate a \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent\" injury.\n2.  **Redressability:** I need to understand if a favorable federal court decision\u2014striking down the limitation in Texas's DNA testing statute (Chapter 64)\u2014would actually remedy the alleged injury. The respondent (Texas) will likely argue that even with a favorable ruling, a chain of future events (e.g., the DNA test results being inconclusive, state courts still denying the habeas petition) is too speculative to establish redressability.\n\nThis framework clarifies that the case is not a direct ruling on a constitutional right to post-conviction DNA testing. Instead, it is about whether a federal court is the proper forum for this specific inmate to challenge this specific state law. The interaction between the state statutes (Chapter 64 and Article 11.071) and the federal cause of action (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) is the critical legal nexus. My predictive model must now focus on how the current Supreme Court justices have previously ruled on standing, particularly in cases involving speculative chains of causation and challenges to state criminal procedures. The next crucial piece of information will be the specific arguments presented in the petitioner's brief to substantiate his injury and its redressability.",

This action directly targets that uncertainty. The respondent's brief will reveal whether they have a plausible argument for distinguishing this case from *Reed*, a weak argument that confirms my current belief, or a novel argument I haven't considered. Any of these outcomes will cause a substantial update to my predictive model, making the Task EIG extremely high. For Design EIG, this action provides a perfect case study in argument-counterargument dynamics, specifically how a party attempts to litigate around a very recent, on-point, and seemingly adverse precedent. Observing this strategy will provide generalizable insights into how the Court evaluates such distinctions, improving my overall predictive methodology for future cases.",

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution.

Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D.

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigat\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n0: 20240709134310169_Proof20of20Service.json (score: 0.414)\nNos. 23-7809, 23A1160 \n \n \nIN THE  \nSupreme Court of the United States \n____________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nLUIS V.

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel). He also unsuccessfully \nsought state habeas relief; his subsequent application dismissed as abusive. \nOrder, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Aug. 24, 2011). \n\n6 \n \n \nAfter the state litigation ended, the district court reopened the federal \nhabeas proceeding and denied Gutierrez relief and a certificate of appealability \n(COA). Mem. Op. & Order, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nOct. 3, 2013), ECF No. 44. Gutierrez then sought a COA from the Fifth Circuit, \nbut his request was denied. Gutierrez v. Stephens, 590 F. App\u2019x 371, 384 (5th \nCir. 2014). This Court later denied him certiorari review. Gutierrez v. Stephens, \n577 U.S. 829 (2015). \n \nThe state trial court then set a date for Gutierrez\u2019s execution. Order \nSetting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Apr. 11, 2018). About a month and a half before this \nexecution date, Gutierrez\u2019s federally appointed counsel moved to withdraw \nfrom the case. Mot. Withdraw & Appoint Substitute Counsel, Gutierrez v. \nDavis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018), ECF No. 56. New counsel were \nappointed and a stay of execution entered to allow them time to gain \nfamiliarity with the case. Order, Gutierrez v. Davis, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. \nAug. 22, 2018), ECF No. 79. The Fifth Circuit refused to vacate the stay. Order, \nGutierrez v. Davis, No. 18-70028 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2018). \n \nAfter the federal stay expired, the state trial court again set an execution \ndate. Order Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt., Cameron Cnty., Tex. June 28, 2019). The TCCA stayed this execution date \non state law matters concerning the warrant of execution. In re Gutierrez, No. \n\n7 \n \nWR-59,552-03, 2019 WL 5418389, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2019); see \nalso In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-03, 2020 WL 915300, at *1 (Tex. Crim. \nApp. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nAbout a month after the second execution date was initially set,2 \nGutierrez filed his second motion for postconviction DNA testing. Mot. Post-\nConviction DNA Testing, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. June 14, 2019). The trial court denied his motion and the \nTCCA affirmed. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,089, 2020 WL 918669, at *9 (Tex. \nCrim. App. Feb. 26, 2020). \n \nOnce more, the state trial court set an execution date for Gutierrez. \nOrder Setting Execution, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., \nCameron Cnty., Tex. Feb. 28, 2020). About two weeks before that execution \ndate, Gutierrez moved to recall the execution order on state law grounds, but \nthe request was denied. Order Deny Convict Gutierrez\u2019s Mot., State v. \nGutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 28, \n2020). Gutierrez moved the TCCA for leave to file a petition for a writ of \nmandamus to recall the execution order and a stay of execution. Pet. Writ \nMandamus, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 2, 2020); \n \n2  \nThe trial court initially set an execution date with an order signed May 1, 2019, \nbut that execution date was later withdrawn. See Order Setting Execution Date, State \nv. Gutierrez, No. 98-CV-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 1, 2019). \n\n8 \n \nMot. Stay Execution, In re Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June \n2, 2020). Gutierrez also moved the TCCA for a stay of execution in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The motions were denied. Notice, In re Gutierrez, No. \nWR-59,552-04 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nAbout a week before the 2020 execution date, Gutierrez filed yet another \nsubsequent state habeas application. Subsequent Appl. Post-conviction Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. Ct., Cameron \nCnty., Tex. June 8, 2020). He also moved the TCCA to stay his execution based \non this application. Mot. Stay Execution Pending Disposition of Subsequent \nAppl. Post-conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus, Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-\n59,552-05 (Tex. Crim. App. June 8, 2020). The TCCA found Gutierrez failed to \n\u201csatisfy the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 or Article 11.073 [of the Texas \nCode of Criminal Procedure],\u201d so it \u201cdismiss[ed] the application as an abuse of \nthe writ without reviewing the merits of the claims raised\u201d and denied his \nmotion for a stay. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-05, 2020 WL 3118514, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 12, 2020). \nGutierrez also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit challenging as \nunconstitutional, among other things, the absence in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing.3 Amended Compl., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., \n \n3  \nGutierrez\u2019s complaint also challenged the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice\u2019s (TDCJ) then-existing policy excluding from the execution room outside \n\n9 \n \nNo. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020), ECF No. 45. The Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint, which the district court granted as to many \nof Gutierrez\u2019s claims but denied as to the claims that raised cognizable \nchallenges to the constitutionality of Chapter 64. Mem. & Order, Gutierrez v. \nSaenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020), ECF No. 48. The district court \nlater granted Gutierrez a stay of execution. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 57. The Fifth Circuit vacated the \nstay. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 818 F. App\u2019x 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2020). This Court \ngranted Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari (which raised only spiritual-\nadvisor claims), vacated the Fifth Circuit\u2019s order, and remanded for \nconsideration of the spiritual-advisor claims.4 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 141 S. Ct. \n1260, 1260\u201361 (2021).  \nOn remand, the district court rejected Gutierrez\u2019s primary challenge to \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard, but it granted a declaratory judgment as to \n \nspiritual advisors. Those claims were ultimately dismissed as moot after the policy \nwas changed. Order of Dismissal, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. \nTex. Mar. 10, 2023), ECF No. 213. \n \n4  \nGutierrez was set to be executed in October 2021, but the execution date was \nwithdrawn due to litigation in another case raising spiritual-advisor claims similar \nto Gutierrez\u2019s. Order Vacating Order, State v. Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391 (107th Dist. \nCt. Cameron Cnty., Sept. 21, 2015); see Ramirez v. Collier, No. 21-5592, 2021 WL \n4129220, at *1 (Sept. 10, 2021). \n\n10 \n \nthe absence in Chapter 64 of a provision for punishment-related DNA testing.5 \nMem. & Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, \n2021), ECF No. 141. The district court later entered a partial final judgment \nas to Gutierrez\u2019s DNA claims, which dismissed or denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s \nchallenges to Chapter 64 other than the one as to which the court granted a \ndeclaratory judgment. Order 4, Gutierrez v. Saenz, No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. \nDec. 8, 2021), ECF No. 188. Respondents appealed the district court\u2019s \ndeclaratory judgment.  \nOn appeal, the Fifth Circuit held Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the \ndeclaratory judgment the district court granted. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 \nF.4th at 275. The Fifth Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s judgment and \nremanded the case for the complaint to be dismissed. Id. The Fifth Circuit \ndenied Gutierrez\u2019s petition for rehearing and his motion to stay issuance of \nmandate.6 Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al, No. 21-70009 (5th Cir. June 7, \n2024), ECF No. 148-2; On Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 21-70009 (5th Cir. May 29, 2024), ECF No. 138-\n \n5  \nRespondents appealed the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, but the appeal \nwas dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 21-70002 \n(5th Cir. June 24, 2021). \n \n6  \nThe district court has since dismissed Gutierrez\u2019s complaint. Order, Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 18, 2024). \n\n11 \n \n1. Gutierrez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an application for \na stay of execution. The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133. He obtained a stay of his \nfederal habeas proceedings while he litigated his first request for postconviction DNA \ntesting and a subsequent state habeas application. Order, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009). He requested the federal habeas court to \ngrant \u201cdiscovery\u201d by way of DNA testing. Pet. 92\u201395, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019. See Mot. to Withdraw and for Appointment \nof Sub. Counsel 4, Gutierrez v. Stephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. July 24, 2018); \nComplaint, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 26, 2019). And \nhe repeatedly sought to delay the district court\u2019s resolution of his civil rights lawsuit. \nOrder, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 7, 2020) (order \nstaying proceedings pending TCCA\u2019s resolution of Gutierrez\u2019s second Chapter 64 \nappeal); Order, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex.

Apr. 6, 2021); Pl.\u2019s Br. in Opp. \nto Defs.\u2019 Mot. for Entry of Partial Final J., Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 \n(S.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2021). \n\n17 \n \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 11.071 \u00a7 5(a)(3), \nillusory, and it accordingly granted Gutierrez a declaratory judgment. Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.

This appeal involves one of a multitude of challenges Gutierrez \nhas raised following his capital murder conviction and death sentence. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 269\u201371 (5th Cir. 2024) (summarizing the \n\u201cdecades-long postconviction proceedings\u201d).  \nIn one of the most recent iterations of Gutierrez\u2019s serial challenges to his \nlong-final state court conviction, the Fifth Circuit vacated a declaratory \njudgment entered by the district court, holding Gutierrez did not have standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of a provision of Texas\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64 (Chapter 64), that \npermits testing affecting an inmate\u2019s conviction but not his punishment. Id. at \n275. In another, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) denied \nGutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction DNA testing, reiterating what the \ncourt had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing \neven if Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s \n\n2 \n \npunishment. Gutierrez v. State, No. AP-77,108, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4 (Tex. \nCrim. App. June 27, 2024). \nGutierrez is scheduled to be executed after 6:00 p.m. (Central Time) July \n16, 2024. He now seeks review of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and yet another \nstay of execution. But Gutierrez\u2019s petition and application for a stay of \nexecution are based on nothing more than his disagreement with the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s straightforward application of this Court\u2019s holding in Reed v. Goertz, \n598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023). His overwrought interpretation of that \nstraightforward application presents nothing worthy of this Court\u2019s attention. \nThis Court should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari and application for \na stay of execution. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nFacts Concerning Gutierrez\u2019s Murder of Escolastica Harrison \n \nThe evidence shows that the [eighty-five]-year-old victim \nkept approximately $600,000 in cash in her home which also \nserved as an office for a mobile home park she owned and \nmanaged. The victim had befriended [Gutierrez] and [Gutierrez] \nknew the victim kept a lot of cash in her home office. \n \n[Gutierrez] developed a plan to steal the victim\u2019s money. On \nSeptember 5, 1998, the [twenty-one]-year-old [Gutierrez] and an \naccomplice, whom the victim did not know, went into the victim\u2019s \nhome/office to carry out the plan. When [Gutierrez] and the \naccomplice left with the victim\u2019s money, the victim was dead. She \nhad been beaten and stabbed numerous times. \n \n[Gutierrez] claimed in his third statement to the police that \n\u201cwe\u201d (he and the accomplice) had two different types of \n\n3 \n \nscrewdrivers when they entered the victim\u2019s home/office to steal \nher money. [Gutierrez] also claimed that the initial plan was for \nthe accomplice to lure the victim out of her home/office through the \nfront by some innocent means at which time [Gutierrez] would go \nin through the back and take the victim\u2019s money without the victim \nseeing him. This plan was frustrated when the victim saw \n[Gutierrez] enter through the front door while the accomplice was \nstill inside with her. [Gutierrez] claims that soon after this, the \naccomplice began to beat, kick, and stab the victim with a \nscrewdriver while [Gutierrez] got her money. [Gutierrez] did \nnothing to prevent the accomplice from attacking the victim. \n \nThe medical examiner testified that the victim suffered \nvarious defensive wounds indicating that she struggled for her life \nand tried to \u201cward off blows or attacks of some sort.\u201d The medical \nexaminer also testified that the victim suffered approximately \nthirteen stab wounds, caused by two different instruments\u2014one \n\u201calmost certainly\u201d a flat head screwdriver and the other possibly a \nPhillips head screwdriver. The victim died from \u201cmassive blows to \nthe left side of the face.\u201d \n \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 2\u20133 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 16, \n2002). \nII. \nFacts Relevant to Punishment and the Sentencing Phase of Trial  \nA. \nThe State\u2019s evidence \n \n \nAt punishment, the prosecution presented evidence of \n[Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement with the criminal justice system since he \nwas [fourteen]-years old. As a juvenile, [Gutierrez] committed \nseveral burglaries, he assaulted a police officer, and he threatened \nto kill a teacher and a security officer. Attempts to rehabilitate \n[Gutierrez] \nin \nvarious \njuvenile \ndetention \nfacilities \nwere \nunsuccessful. [Gutierrez] was a disciplinary problem in these \nfacilities and he often escaped from them. \n \n \nAs an adult, [Gutierrez] committed various misdemeanor \noffenses. He also was convicted of forgery. While doing time in \nCameron County Jail on this state jail conviction, [Gutierrez] \n\n4 \n \ninstigated an \u201calmost riot\u201d because county jail employees would \nnot give him any Kool-Aid. Shortly thereafter [Gutierrez] \ncomplained about cold coffee and threw it at a guard. \n \n \nWhile awaiting trial for this offense, [Gutierrez] was \nassigned to the \u201chigh risk\u201d area of the Cameron County Jail from \nwhere [Gutierrez], the accomplice, and another individual \nattempted an escape during which [Gutierrez] told a guard not to \ninterfere or he would be \u201cshanked.\u201d Immediately following the \njury\u2019s guilt/innocence verdict in the instant case, [Gutierrez] said \nthat he might kill an assistant district attorney. \n \nId. at 6. \nB. \nGutierrez\u2019s evidence \n \nDr. Jonathan Sorenson, an expert on future dangerousness, testified \nregarding the actuarial method of assessing an inmate\u2019s potential for future \ndanger. 24 RR 4\u201315.1 He stated data indicates that murderers make the best \ninmates and inmates incarcerated for homicide had a very low likelihood of \ncommitting another one. 24 RR 17, 19\u201322. Moreover, Dr. Sorenson testified \nthat an inmate\u2019s age was the best predictor of future dangerousness and a \ntwenty-one-year-old inmate with a prior criminal record was not more than \nlikely to commit violent acts in the future. 24 RR 27. \n \nThe defense also presented the testimony of Gutierrez\u2019s aunt, Hilda \nGarcia who testified that Gutierrez was easy-going and a responsible husband \nand father. 24 RR 49\u201356. She also testified that Gutierrez was lovable, caring, \n \n1  \n\u201cRR\u201d refers to the Reporter\u2019s Record of transcribed trial proceedings, preceded \nby the volume number and followed by the cited page number(s). \n\n5 \n \nand helpful to people who needed assistance. 24 RR 57. After considering this \nevidence, and \u201cbased on the jury\u2019s findings at the punishment phase, the trial \njudge sentenced [Gutierrez] to death.\u201d Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d 883, 888 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \nIII. \nCourse of State and Federal Proceedings \n \n \nGutierrez\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the TCCA. \nGutierrez v. State, No. AP-73,462, slip op. at 21. The TCCA thereafter denied \nGutierrez state habeas relief. Ex parte Gutierrez, No. WR-59,552-01, 2008 WL \n2059277, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. May 14, 2008).  \n \nGutierrez then filed a federal habeas petition. Pet., Gutierrez v. Stephens, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 1. Instead of ruling on \nGutierrez\u2019s petition, the district court stayed the proceeding to allow Gutierrez \nto return to state court and pursue additional claims. Order, Gutierrez v. \nStephens, No. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 28, 2009), ECF No. 12.  \n \nWhile \nback \nin \nstate \ncourt, \nGutierrez \nunsuccessfully \nsought \npostconviction DNA testing. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901\u201302; \nGutierrez v. State, 307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (dismissing \nappeal of denial of request for appointment of counsel).

June 18, 2024). \n\n11 \n \n1. Gutierrez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an application for \na stay of execution. The instant brief in opposition follows. \nDuring the pendency of his civil-rights lawsuit, Gutierrez filed a third \nmotion for postconviction DNA testing. The trial court initially dismissed it for \nlack of jurisdiction, Order Granting State\u2019s Plea to the J., In re Gutierrez, No. \n98-CR-1391-A (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., July 8, 2021), but the TCCA \nvacated that order. Gutierrez v. State, 663 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Tex. Crim. App. \n2022). The trial court then denied Gutierrez\u2019s third motion for postconviction \nDNA testing on the merits. Order Denying, In re Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A \n(107th Dist. Ct., Cameron Cnty., Tex. May 26, 2022). The TCCA affirmed the \ndenial of Gutierrez\u2019s motion. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *5. \nREASONS FOR DENYING CERTIORARI AND A STAY \nGutierrez has sought DNA testing three times over the course of fifteen \nyears. Each time his request has been rejected because, among other things, \nChapter 64 does not provide for postconviction DNA testing to show innocence \nof the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it. \nGutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. Stated another way, even assuming \na constitutional infirmity existed in Chapter 64 by virtue of the absence of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing, and assuming that infirmity was \ncured, the TCCA has held Gutierrez would not be entitled to an order requiring \nRespondents to release evidence for DNA testing. Id. \n\n12 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit held that because the state court has already spoken \non the very defect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment, Gutierrez lacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374. In reaching that conclusion, the \nFifth Circuit straightforwardly applied the test this Court articulated in Reed. \nId. In arguing the Fifth Circuit erred in holding he lacked standing, Gutierrez \nrelies solely on the fact that the state court rejected his request for DNA \ntesting. And he asks this Court to make the standing analysis a rote exercise \nand a foregone conclusion in every case involving a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing procedures. Gutierrez \ndoesn\u2019t identify any other area of law in which the standing inquiry is so \npreordained. Indeed, Gutierrez\u2019s argument is contrary to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. The Court should decline Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to drastically expand \nits standing jurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and \napplication for a stay of execution should be denied.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nGutierrez Provides No Compelling Reason for Further Review. \nThe Court requires those seeking a writ of certiorari to provide \u201c[a] direct \nand concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the \nwrit.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(h) (emphasis added). Gutierrez argues the Court should \ngrant review to resolve a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth \n\n13 \n \nCircuit and because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding conflicts with Reed. Pet. 11\u201319. \nBut as discussed below, Gutierrez\u2019s true complaint is that the court below \nmisapplied a properly stated rule of law, a plainly insufficient reason to grant \nreview. Sup. Ct. R. 10. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit correctly identified the holding \nof Reed and straightforwardly applied it to the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case. \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (\u201cThe Reed question here is would \na Texas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d). Gutierrez\u2019s bare disagreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s answer \ndoes not justify this Court\u2019s attention. \nGutierrez \u201camplifies\u201d his request for review, pointing to the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s application last year of Reed\u2019s holding in one case.7 Pet. 10\u201312 (citing \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023)). Indeed, Gutierrez admits \n\u201cJohnson is the only other federal appellate opinion to apply Reed in the \ncontext of a prisoner challenging a state post-conviction DNA statute as \nunconstitutional[.]\u201d Pet. 12. But \u201c[t]his Court mostly does not even grant \n \n7  \nGutierrez also points to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Redd v. Guerrero, 84 \nF.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023), a case that did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute. Instead, the case involved a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nchallenge to the state\u2019s failure to appoint him counsel to litigate his habeas case. Id. \nat 881. \n\n14 \n \ncertiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because . . . a bit of \ndisagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215, 392\u201393 (2022) (Breyer, J., \ndissenting); see Calvert v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 1605, 1606 (2021) (Statement of \nSotomayor, J., respecting the denial of certiorari) (\u201cThe legal question Calvert \npresents is complex and would benefit from further percolation in the lower \ncourts prior to this Court granting review.\u201d). On its face, then, the petition \nidentifies no compelling reason warranting this Court\u2019s attention. \nMoreover, as discussed below, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in this case does \nnot conflict with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding in Johnson. The Fifth Circuit \nsimply applied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed to a different set of facts, and its \nstraightforward application of that holding in a factually distinct context does \nnot call for this Court\u2019s intervention. Underneath Gutierrez\u2019s hyperbole about \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is nothing but his bare disagreement with the \noutcome in his case. This Court should not grant certiorari to resolve a \nnonexistent circuit split.  \nII. \nThe Lower Court\u2019s Straightforward Application of Reed Does \nNot Warrant this Court\u2019s Review. \n \nGutierrez assails the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that he lacked standing to \nbring suit, arguing the court misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Reed and \ncalling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \u201cwrong and pernicious.\u201d Pet. 11. He also \n\n15 \n \nargues the holding conflicts with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson. Pet \n12\u201313. In effect, Gutierrez argues that, since this Court found the plaintiff in \nReed had standing, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to find he had standing too.8 \nBut the Reed holding does not render the standing analysis a foregone \nconclusion in every civil rights challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA \ntesting statute.  \nA. \nBackground \nGutierrez first sought postconviction DNA testing under Chapter 64 \nmore than fifteen years ago. See Ex parte Gutierrez, No. 98-CR-1391-A, 2009 \nWL 8537247 (107th Dist. Ct. Cameron Cnty., May 18, 2009) (order denying \nappointment of counsel under Chapter 64). The TCCA rejected the request \nbecause identity was not an issue in Gutierrez\u2019s case and exculpatory results \nwould not demonstrate his innocence. Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 899\u2013\n902.  The TCCA also found Gutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his \ntrial in 1999. Id. at 896\u201397. Gutierrez has now leveraged that strategic decision \n \n8  \nThe dissent in the court below refused to consider the facts of Gutierrez\u2019s case \nand instead said, \u201c[b]ecause the standing analysis of Reed applies here, Gutierrez, \nalso facing execution, has standing to bring suit.\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 276 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). In addition to failing to engage \nwith the specifics of Gutierrez\u2019s case, the dissent relied on the fact that both Reed and \nGutierrez are \u201cfacing execution,\u201d a fact that is entirely irrelevant to the standing \nanalysis. \n \n\n16 \n \nfor decades.9 Moreover, the TCCA held\u2014more than thirteen years ago\u2014that \nChapter 64 does not \u201cauthorize testing when exculpatory testing results might \naffect only the punishment or sentence that he received.\u201d Id. at 901. The TCCA \nhas twice reiterated to Gutierrez that plain holding. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 \nWL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nGutierrez\u2019s civil-rights lawsuit alleged Chapter 64 is unconstitutional in \nseveral ways. Amended Compl. 19\u201330, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-\n185 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2020). The district court rejected all the challenges \nexcept for Gutierrez\u2019s claim that the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated DNA testing was unconstitutional because it rendered a portion of \n \n9  \nGutierrez has now filed three unsuccessful motions for postconviction DNA \ntesting. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.

Quarterman, \nNo. 1:09-CV-22 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009). He requested the federal habeas court to \ngrant \u201cdiscovery\u201d by way of DNA testing. Pet. 92\u201395, Gutierrez v. Quarterman, 1:09-\nCV-22 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2012). He obtained new counsel and a stay of his first \nscheduled execution date in 2018 to file a civil rights lawsuit regarding the denial of \nDNA testing\u2014then failed to file such a lawsuit for more than a year until he was \nscheduled to be executed in October 2019.

Order, \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2021). The problem \nfor Gutierrez, however, was that the TCCA had already spoken on that issue, \nholding that Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing even if such a \nprovision existed. See Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL 3220514, at *2\u20133.  \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent. \nIn District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial District v. Osborne, this \nCourt held there is no substantive due process right to DNA testing. 557 U.S. \n52, 72\u201373 (2009). Rather, an inmate can only demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation by showing a \u201cState\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2018offends \nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people \nas to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 or \u2018transgresses any recognized principle of \nfundamental fairness in operation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 69 (quoting Medina v. California, \n505 U.S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)). The Court otherwise left the task of \u201chow to \nharness DNA\u2019s power to prove innocence\u201d to the legislatures. Id. at 62.  \nThis Court later held in Skinner v. Switzer that a procedural due process \nchallenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute may be pursued \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 562 U.S. 521, 525 (2011). But the Court recognized \nOsborne \u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law \n\n18 \n \ndenies him procedural due process.\u201d Id. The Court assured that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Id. at 534\u201335.  \nAs to standing, this Court requires a plaintiff to adequately allege (1) an \ninjury, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (3) would \nlikely be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these \nelements, which are \u201cindispensable\u201d parts of a lawsuit and must be proven \nrather than merely pled. Id. at 561.  \nIn Reed, this Court held the plaintiff had standing to sue a district \nattorney to seek a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter \n64 because the plaintiff suffered an injury (denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting), and the district attorney denied him that access. 598 U.S. at 234. The \nCourt found an order declaring the challenged statutory procedures violated \ndue process would \u201celiminate\u201d the district attorney\u2019s justification for denying \nDNA testing, i.e., it was substantially likely the district attorney \u201cwould abide \nby such a court order.\u201d Id. However, this Court has also held that an action \nseeking a declaratory judgment \u201cmust be real and substantial and admit of \nspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from \nan opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 672 (2021) (cleaned up). And \u201ca declaration \nthat the statutory provision [the plaintiffs] attack is unconstitutional . . . is the \n\n19 \n \nvery kind of relief that cannot alone supply jurisdiction otherwise absent.\u201d10 \nId. at 673.  \nIn Utah v. Evans, Utah alleged the Census Bureau\u2019s method of counting \nthe population violated federal statute and the Constitution. 536 U.S. 452, 459 \n(2002). The state sought an injunction compelling a change in the census \nresults. Id. The Court, relying on its prior holding in a materially \nindistinguishable case, held Utah had standing to seek such an injunction \nbecause a court could order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate its \nnumbers and recertify the census result. Id. at 459\u201364 (discussing Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 807 (1992)). In doing so, the Court conducted a \ndetailed assessment of the facts and applicable federal statutes and found an \ninjunction requiring issuance of a new census report \u201cwould bring about\u201d the \nrelief Utah sought, i.e., new congressional apportionment. Id. \nRecently, this Court emphasized standing\u2019s limits. See FDA v. Alliance \nfor Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 380\u201381 (2024). In holding the plaintiffs \n \n10  \nAs the district court explained, it had jurisdiction only to grant a declaratory \njudgment as to the constitutionality of Chapter 64, not to compel state officials to \nrelease evidence for DNA testing. Order 11\u201312, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-\nCV-185 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2020); see Moye v. Clerk, Dekalb Cnty. Superior Court, 474 \nF.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Gutierrez did not complain on appeal in the court \nbelow, nor does he maintain in his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, that the district \ncourt\u2019s holding in that regard was error. Any such argument would, therefore, be \nwaived. See Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 234 (1976) (\u201cOrdinarily, this Court does \nnot decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court.\u201d); California, 593 U.S. \nat 674 (declining to consider argument not presented to the circuit court and not \nraised at the certiorari stage). \n\n20 \n \nin Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lacked standing, the Court explained that \nsome legal questions are left \u201cto the political and democratic processes.\u201d 602 \nU.S. at 396. The Court also emphasized that it has long rejected an \u201cif not us, \nwho?\u201d argument for standing. Id. Moreover, the Court explained that standing \ncan be absent based on the redressability element, alone, where a plaintiff \nsuffers an injury caused by the government that is not \u201cof the kind \n\u2018traditionally redressable in federal court.\u2019\u201d Id. at 381 n.1. And while causation \nand redressability are often flip sides of the same coin, the causation element \ncannot be proven by speculation. Id. at 381, 384. Indeed, \u201cthe causation inquiry \ncan be heavily fact-dependent and a \u2018question of degree[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 383. Critically \nhere, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (June 26, 2024) (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)). Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim and for each form of relief he seeks. Id. \nC. \nThe lower court properly applied this Court\u2019s precedent. \nAs discussed above, in Reed, the plaintiff sought and was denied in state \ncourt access to evidence for DNA testing, in part because he failed to satisfy \nChapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. 598 U.S. at 233. He later filed a \ncivil rights action against the local prosecutor, alleging Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-\ncustody requirement was unconstitutional. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed on \nlimitations grounds. Id. at 233\u201334. This Court reversed, first holding the \n\n21 \n \nplaintiff had standing to bring suit. Id. at 234. The Court held the plaintiff \nsufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to evidence for DNA \ntesting. Id. The Court also found a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s \nconduct and the injury: the defendant denied the plaintiff access to the \nevidence. Id. And the Court found the injury was redressable through the civil \nrights action because a federal court judgment that Chapter 64\u2019s procedures \nwere unconstitutional \u201cwould eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s justification for \ndenying DNA testing,\u201d would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \nevidence for testing. Id. (emphasis added).  \nIn doing so, the Court articulated a test for determining whether a \nplaintiff in such an action has standing\u2014it did not hold that every unsuccessful \nstate court litigant will have standing to seek a judgment declaring his state\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing procedures unconstitutional. See id. This \nnecessarily raises the question of which litigants lack standing. See Murthy, \n2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11. \nHere, Gutierrez twice sought DNA testing via Chapter 64 before filing \nhis civil rights lawsuit. See Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 269\u201370. Gutierrez\u2019s \nrequests were based, in part, on his assertion that the results of DNA testing \nwould show he was innocent of the death penalty. See id. On both occasions, \nthe TCCA held Gutierrez was not entitled to testing because Chapter 64 did \n\n22 \n \nnot contain a provision for testing when the results would affect only the \ninmate\u2019s punishment. See id. at 269\u201370. But, critically, the TCCA also found \nGutierrez would not have been entitled to the testing he sought even if Chapter \n64 contained such a provision. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL 918669, at *8.  \nGutierrez then turned to federal court where his civil rights action \nalleged, among other things, that the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for \npunishment-related DNA testing violated his right to due process. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 270\u201371. The district court agreed and entered \na declaratory judgment to that effect.11 See id. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit held \nGutierrez\u2019s civil rights action should have been dismissed because he lacked \nstanding to challenge the absence of a provision in Chapter 64 for punishment-\nrelated testing where the TCCA \u201calready held\u201d what the effect of such a \ndeclaratory judgment would be. Id. at 275.  \nIn reaching its conclusion, the Fifth Circuit simply applied the test from \nReed. As explained above, this Court found the plaintiff in Reed had standing \nbecause a favorable judgment would eliminate the defendant\u2019s justification for \nrefusing access to evidence, would result in a change in legal status, and would \nsignificantly increase the likelihood the defendant would grant access to the \n \n11  \nAs discussed above, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s other challenges \nto Chapter 64. Order 14, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Aug. \n19, 2021). \n\n23 \n \nevidence. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Fifth Circuit appropriately summarized \nthe relevant question from Reed as applied to the facts of this case: \u201cwould a \nTexas prosecutor, having in hand a federal court\u2019s opinion that a DNA testing \nrequirement violated federal law and also an earlier [TCCA] opinion that this \nparticular prisoner was not injured by that specific violation, likely order the \nDNA testing?\u201d Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 273\u201374 (emphasis in original). \nThe court\u2019s answer to the question was appropriately no. Id. The district \ncourt\u2019s declaratory judgment in this case did not eliminate Respondents\u2019 \njustification for refusing access to the evidence. Id. The TCCA\u2019s finding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing because it \nwould not help him show he is innocent of the death penalty remains \nuntouched by the declaratory judgment, and the finding provides an ongoing, \nindependent justification for Respondents not to agree to testing despite the \nalleged constitutional infirmity in Chapter 64. Indeed, Respondents declined \nto release evidence for DNA testing and the TCCA reiterated its holding a third \ntime after the district court entered its declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. \nState, 2024 WL 3220514, at *4. The declaratory judgment effected no change \nin legal status, and it plainly did not increase the likelihood Respondents would \ngrant Gutierrez access to the evidence for testing. In this respect, the lack of \nstanding in this case does not merely come down to a \u201cquestion of degree.\u201d \n\n24 \n \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. Redressability has been \ndisproven here.  \nAs noted above, this Court did not hold or suggest in Reed that every \ninmate has standing to challenge a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute \nsimply because he was unsuccessful in state court. Reed, 598 U.S. at 234; see \nMurthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *9 (standing is not dispensed in gross); cf. \nSchlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227 (1974) \n(\u201cThe assumption that if [plaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have \nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d). And if this Court\u2019s articulation in \nReed of the test for standing is to be taken at face value, then the lower court \nproperly found some litigants will fail to meet it. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11 (holding an injunction was unlikely to provide plaintiffs \nredress). \nImportantly, the Fifth Circuit properly understood this Court\u2019s \nprecedent to require a fact- and claim-specific assessment of whether a \nfavorable judgment would likely affect the defendant. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 \nF.4th at 274 (citing Utah, 536 U.S. at 460\u201361); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. \nat 431. This was consistent not only with this Court\u2019s opinion in Reed, 598 U.S. \nat 234, but also with the Court\u2019s long line of standing jurisprudence, see, e.g., \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561\u201362 (the plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing\u2014\nan indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014which must be supported in the \n\n25 \n \nsame way as any other matter the plaintiff must prove). Indeed, the Court has \nlong held that it must not be merely speculative that an injury will be redressed \nby a favorable decision by the federal court. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. As \ndiscussed above, the Court has also held a declaratory judgment cannot alone \nconfer standing. California, 593 U.S. at 673. And if, depending on the facts of \nthe case, it may be \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that a defendant would change course \nin light of a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment, it stands to reason there will \nbe cases where it is unlikely a defendant would do so. See Murthy, 2024 WL \n3165801, at *16 n.11; Reed, 598 U.S. at 234. Considering that the TCCA has \nalready spoken on the issue here three times, effectively redressing the alleged \nconstitutional defect in Chapter 64 and providing Respondents an independent \njustification for declining to agree to DNA testing, Gutierrez\u2019s case clearly fell \nin the latter category. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding was plainly in keeping with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. \nContrary to Gutierrez\u2019s argument, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion does not \nrequire a parsing analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s arguments in state court or a \u201cpre-\njurisdictional mini-trial.\u201d Pet. 11. Instead, the Fifth Circuit recognized a rather \nobvious distinction between Gutierrez\u2019s facts and Reed\u2019s\u2014the TCCA had \nalready spoken as to whether, if an alleged constitutional infirmity was cured, \nGutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing and found he would not. Gutierrez \nv. Saenz, 93 F.4th at 275. And the only \u201cscour[ing]\u201d the Fifth Circuit did of the \n\n26 \n \nstate court record was to read the parties\u2019 state court briefs and the TCCA\u2019s \nopinion in Reed\u2019s case, a rather simple task.12 Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th at \n275 n.4. And recognition of this distinction does not mean the court grafted \nonto the Reed test any onerous requirements. As discussed above, standing \nmust be maintained as to each claim. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis is quite simple and straightforward, particularly \nin the context of a challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. As \nthe court put it, \u201ca state prosecutor is quite likely to follow what his state\u2019s \nhighest criminal court has already held should be the effect\u201d of a decision that \na particular procedure violated federal law. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th \nat 274. That\u2019s all. \nBy way of example, Gutierrez raised in his civil rights complaint several \nadditional grounds alleging constitutional infirmities in Chapter 64. See \nGutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. 1:19-CV-185, 2020 WL 12771965, at *2 (S.D. Tex. \nJune 2, 2020) (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s claims). One of those claims was that \nChapter 64\u2019s materiality standard is too burdensome. Id. Gutierrez argued in \nstate court that his Chapter 64 motion satisfied the materiality standard, but \nthe TCCA did not opine on whether Gutierrez would be entitled to DNA testing \n \n12  \nTo the extent the Fifth Circuit went \u201cbeyond\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Reed, Pet. \n15, it was merely to confirm whether the distinction it drew was consistent with the \nfacts of Reed. This does not show \u201cpernicious\u201d disregard for this Court, Pet. 11, but \nrather attentiveness.  \n\n27 \n \neven if the materiality standard was lower. Gutierrez v. State, 2020 WL \n918669, at *6\u20139; Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 900\u201302. Under Reed, then, \nGutierrez would likely have standing to raise a procedural due process \nchallenge to Chapter 64\u2019s materiality standard because a federal court \njudgment that the standard violated federal law would severely undermine, if \nnot eliminate, the justification for refusing access to evidence for testing on \nthat basis.13 Reed, 598 U.S. at 234.  \nAgain, the TCCA\u2019s repeated holding that Gutierrez would not be entitled \nto punishment-related DNA testing even if Chapter 64 provided for it is a \nmeaningful distinction, one that prevents Gutierrez from showing a \ndeclaratory judgment would have any effect on the likelihood Respondents \nwould agree to DNA testing. Far from a \u201cpernicious\u201d holding that requires \nscouring the record, Pet. 11, 15, the Fifth Circuit simply recognized there can \nbe no redress in federal court where the state court has already provided it as \nto the very claim the plaintiff raises. Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F.4th at 274; \nsee Murthy, 2024 WL 3165801, at *16 n.11 (explaining the Court did not apply \nan elevated standard for redressability that required a \u201ccertainty\u201d of redress \nbut rather simply concluded \u201can injunction against the Government \n \n13  \nThe district court denied Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s \u201cpreponderance \nof the evidence\u201d materiality standard. Order 21\u201322, Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., No. \n1:19-CV-185 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2021). Gutierrez did not appeal that decision. \n\n28 \n \ndefendants [was] unlikely to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs\u2019 \nspeech\u201d). \nGutierrez argues this distinction between his case and Reed\u2019s is wrong. \nPet. 19. He argues the prosecutor in Reed could still have relied on the TCCA\u2019s \nholding that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed bringing his Chapter 64 motion \nas a reason to refuse access to evidence, but this Court nonetheless found he \nhad standing to challenge Chapter 64\u2019s chain-of-custody requirement. Pet. 19. \nGutierrez\u2019s argument elides that standing operates claim-by-claim and is often \n\u201ca question of degree.\u201d Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384; see \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431.  \nIn Reed, the TCCA did not provide alternative holdings as to the \nchallenged provisions by assuming an infirmity existed in Chapter 64 but \nfinding he would still not be entitled to testing if that infirmity was cured. Reed \nv. State, 541 S.W.3d 759, 769\u201372, 777\u201380; see Gutierrez v. Saenz, et al., 93 F. \n4th at 274 n.4. Moreover, in addition to alleging the chain-of-custody \nrequirement violated procedural due process, the plaintiff in Reed also raised \nin federal court a constitutional challenge to Chapter 64\u2019s unreasonable delay \nprovision. See Reed v. Goertz, No. A-19-CV-794, 2019 WL 12073901, at *6 n.6 \n(W.D. Tex. Nov. 15, 2019). If Reed succeeds on appeal in showing both the \nchain-of-custody requirement and the unreasonable delay provisions are \nunconstitutional, the defendant would have nothing to fall back on, i.e., \n\n29 \n \nalternative holdings by the state court that Reed would not be entitled to \ntesting even if the infirmities in those provisions were cured. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234 (\u201c[I]f a federal court concludes that Texas\u2019s post-conviction procedures \nviolate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor\u2019s \njustification for denying DNA testing.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \nAgain, the district court denied all of Gutierrez\u2019s challenges to Chapter \n64 other than his challenge to the absence of a provision for punishment-\nrelated testing. Gutierrez has abandoned the rejected challenges by failing to \nappeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court\u2019s declaratory \njudgment as to Gutierrez\u2019s singular remaining claim provides no redress \nbecause the TCCA has already spoken on the issue, and Gutierrez cannot \neliminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the evidence. See \nTransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (\u201cPlaintiffs must maintain their personal \ninterest in the dispute at all stages of litigation.\u201d). \nThe distinction the Fifth Circuit drew between this case and Reed \nhighlights the sense in requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate standing for each \nstatutory challenge. Where, as here, the state court has already effectively \nprovided a remedy for a particular claim by construing the challenged \nstatutory provision in the very way the plaintiff asserts it must be to comply \nwith procedural due process, the plaintiff cannot show a prosecutor would be \nmoved in any way to agree to release evidence for testing. Gutierrez v. Saenz, \n\n30 \n \net al., 93 F.4th at 274. Indeed, a federal court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be \nentirely superfluous in such a case, as the district court\u2019s judgment here was, \nand the only conceivable \u201cremedy\u201d would be a political one, i.e., a naked appeal \nto a prosecutor as a political officer to agree to testing. But even such \u201ccrucial \ndecisions\u201d are appropriately left \u201cto the political processes.\u201d Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 380. \nRelatedly, Gutierrez bemoans that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \n\u201cindividualize[s]\u201d the standing inquiry. Pet. 13, 18. But standing is \nindividualized, and it must be adequately alleged and then proven. See Utah, \n536 U.S. at 459\u201364; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; id. at 562\u201371 (extensively \nconducting a detailed standing analysis). Gutierrez\u2019s complaint about the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s holding, at bottom, is merely his preference that he have no burden \nto demonstrate standing other than to show he lost in state court. This Court\u2019s \nprecedent does not countenance such a generalized and low bar to invoking \nfederal court jurisdiction. See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 431 (standing is \nnot dispensed in gross); Skinner, 562 U.S. at 535 (assuring that fears of a vast \nexpansion of federal jurisdiction were unwarranted). \nFor the same reasons, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Johnson does not \nreflect a circuit split this Court must now resolve. Indeed, nothing in the \nJohnson opinion indicates that its facts resemble those here. The plaintiff in \nJohnson was denied testing in state court because the DNA testing he \n\n31 \n \nrequested would not advance his claim of innocence, i.e., his request did not \nsatisfy the state law\u2019s requirement that he show the new testing results would \nbe material. 69 F.4th at 509; Johnson v. Rutledge, No. 4:21-CV-373, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2022); Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 270\u2013\n72 (Ark. 2019). The plaintiff alleged in federal court that Arkansas\u2019s \npostconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively construed, violated his \nconstitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality standard. \nJohnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th at 509, 509 n.6; Johnson v. Rutledge, 2022 WL \n990277, at *8 (describing the plaintiff\u2019s procedural due process claim). But in \nrejecting the request for testing, the state court did not assume the materiality \nstandard was too high and find, applying a lower materiality standard, the \nplaintiff would still have not been entitled to testing. Johnson v. State, 591 \nS.W.3d at 270\u201372. Therefore, a favorable judgment in federal court would have, \nin fact, eliminated the defendant\u2019s justification for refusing access to evidence \nfor testing based on the challenged provision of state law. See id. at 272 (\u201cWe \nneed not consider the remaining claims given Johnson\u2019s failure to make this \npredicate showing.\u201d). Stated another way, the state court had not already \neffectively provided a remedy, as the TCCA did here, and find the plaintiff \nwould not be entitled to testing even if the alleged constitutional infirmity in \nthe statute was cured. \n\n32 \n \nAs discussed above, the TCCA\u2019s finding that Gutierrez would be \ndisentitled to testing even if Chapter 64 provided for the type of testing he \nrequested means Respondents still have an independent reason\u2014one that does \nnot rely on another allegedly unconstitutional provision in the statute\u2014to \nrefuse Gutierrez access to evidence for testing. Indeed, the TCCA\u2019s holding that \nGutierrez would not be entitled to punishment-related DNA testing even if \nChapter 64 provided for it acts breaks the causation chain here because it \neffectively provided a remedy by interpreting Chapter 64 in a way to cure what \nGutierrez alleged was a constitutional infirmity. This entirely distinguishes \nGutierrez\u2019s case from Johnson. \nGutierrez also argues the lower court\u2019s holding conflicts with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s holding in Redd. Pet. 13\u201314. As discussed above, Redd did not involve \na challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute. Nonetheless, it \ndoes not help Gutierrez. Nothing in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion indicates it \nresembles the facts here, i.e., where a state court has already opined on the \nalleged constitutional infirmity and found the plaintiff would not be entitled to \nrelief even if that infirmity were cured. Redd is simply inapposite. And to the \nextent Gutierrez argues the Fifth Circuit undertook an \u201cindividualized \nstanding analysis\u201d unlike the Ninth Circuit, he fails to show the Fifth Circuit \nerred when Reed quite literally requires such an analysis. Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. \n\n33 \n \nIn effect, Gutierrez seeks to jettison any requirement for an unsuccessful \nstate court litigant to satisfy the elements of standing when raising a \nprocedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction DNA testing \nscheme. He fails to justify such a drastic departure from this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. This Court\u2019s precedent required Gutierrez to adequately allege \na declaratory judgment would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood \nRespondents would agree to DNA testing for the purpose of permitting \nGutierrez to show his innocence of the death penalty. See Reed, 598 U.S. at \n234. Given that Respondents still have an independent and adequate reason \nnot to agree to the testing, Gutierrez simply could not maintain standing to \nbring this particular claim in federal court. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in that \nregard is entirely consistent with Reed and this Court\u2019s standing \njurisprudence. Gutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nIII. \nGutierrez Does Not Deserve Another Stay of Execution. \nA. \nThe stay standard  \n \nA stay of execution \u201cis not available as a matter of right, and equity must \nbe sensitive to the State\u2019s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments \nwithout undue interference from the federal courts.\u201d Hill v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 573, 583\u201384 (2006) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649\u201350 \n(2004)). Gutierrez must satisfy all the requirements for a stay, including a \nshowing of a significant possibility of success on the merits. Id. (citing Barefoot \n\n34 \n \nv. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895\u201396 (1983)). When a stay of execution is requested, \na court must consider: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 \nU.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \u201cThe first two factors of the traditional standard are the \nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be \u2018better \nthan negligible.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted) The first factor is met in this context by \nshowing \u201ca reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue \nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari\u201d and \u201ca fair prospect that a majority \nof the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, \n558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam). \nA federal court must also consider \u201cthe State\u2019s strong interest in \nproceeding with its judgment\u201d and \u201cattempt[s] at manipulation,\u201d as well as \u201cthe \nextent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.\u201d \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 649\u201350. Indeed, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against the \ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to \nallow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\u201d Id. at 650. \n\u201cBoth the State and the victims of crimes have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence,\u201d and courts \u201cmust be sensitive to the State\u2019s \n\n35 \n \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference \nfrom the federal courts.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584.  \nB. \nGutierrez fails to show likely success on the merits. \nAs explained above, Gutierrez cannot show he is likely to succeed in \nobtaining review and reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment. Additionally, \nGutierrez\u2019s procedural due process claim is time barred and meritless.  \nAs to the time bar, this Court held in Reed that the two-year limitations \nperiod to raise a procedural due process challenge to a state\u2019s postconviction \nDNA testing statute accrues \u201cwhen the state litigation ended and deprived [the \nplaintiff] of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d 598 U.S. at 236. The \nlitigation in this case ended when the TCCA said in 2011 that Chapter 64 does \nnot provide for postconviction DNA testing for the purpose of affecting \npunishment. See Ex parte Gutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 901. Gutierrez\u2019s procedural \ndue process claim was complete at that time,14 and he should have raised the \nclaim at the latest by May 2013. He did not file his civil rights complaint until \n2019. Therefore, even if Gutierrez had standing to seek the declaratory \njudgment he obtained, he did so many years too late. Gutierrez\u2019s assertion in \nthe court below that his serial filing of Chapter 64 motions reinitiates his \n \n14  \nGutierrez did not file a motion for rehearing or a petition for a writ of certiorari \nfollowing the TCCA\u2019s 2011 opinion. \n\n36 \n \nlimitations period finds no support in this Court\u2019s precedent.15 Indeed, \nGutierrez cannot create new accruals simply by asking the TCCA to tell him \nagain that he is not entitled to DNA testing to show he is innocent of the death \npenalty. Therefore, the Court should decline to stay Gutierrez\u2019s execution \nwhere his claim is plainly time barred. \nLastly, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the absence in Chapter 64 of a \nprovision for punishment-related testing is simply meritless. \u201c[E]very court of \nappeals to have applied the Osborne test to a state\u2019s procedure for \npostconviction DNA testing has upheld the constitutionality of it.\u201d Cromartie \nv. Shealy, 941 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2019). And Gutierrez\u2019s facial \nchallenge to Chapter 64 is \u201cthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, \nsince [he] must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the \nAct would be valid.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution where he has failed to \ndemonstrate the merit of his claim.  \n \n15  \nGutierrez has also argued his claim is not time barred because an entirely \nseparate provision of Chapter 64\u2014the \u201cno fault\u201d provision\u2014was removed from the \nstatute in 2011. He failed entirely to show an irrelevant amendment to a statute \nresurrected the accrual date for challenges to all other provisions of the statute. See \nWhitaker v. Collier, 862 F.3d 490, 495 (5th Cir. 2017). Similarly, Gutierrez\u2019s request \nfor equitable tolling failed for many reasons, most importantly his failure to file suit \nuntil eight years after the TCCA authoritatively construed Chapter 64 in the way he \nnow alleges violates procedural due process. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 \n(2007) (\u201cEquitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, \nnot a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\u201d). \n\n37 \n \nNotably, this Court recently vacated a stay of execution in Nasser v. \nMurphy, 144 S. Ct. 324 (2023), in which the plaintiff raised essentially the \nsame claim regarding Chapter 64 as Gutierrez, Murphy v. Nasser, 84 F.4th \n288, 290 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cMurphy challenges the limitation of testing to \nevidence affecting guilt.\u201d).16 As in that case, Gutierrez is not entitled to a stay \nof execution to litigate a meritless claim. See Murphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399 \n(Smith, J., dissenting) (explaining that the district court\u2019s order granting a stay \nof execution based on the declaratory judgment in this case was an abuse of \ndiscretion).  \nImportantly, there is no due process right to collateral proceedings at all. \nSee Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989). And as Judge Smith \nexplained in his dissent in Murphy, the absence of a provision for punishment \nrelated DNA testing does not render Texas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute illusory. \nMurphy, 84 F.4th at 298\u201399. Moreover, the TCCA has declined to interpret its \nabuse of the writ bar as fully incorporating this Court\u2019s \u201cinnocence-of-the-\ndeath-penalty\u201d doctrine. Id. at 299 (citing Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \nn.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). And inmates like Gutierrez can make use of \nTexas\u2019s abuse of the writ statute by means other than DNA testing. Id. at 300. \n \n16  \nThe district court granted a stay of execution, and the majority opinion in \nMurphy did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. Murphy, 84 F.4th \nat 291. \n\n38 \n \nAlthough Judge Smith stated the DNA evidence Gutierrez seeks is relevant to \nthe degree of his culpability as a principal or party for his crime of conviction, \nid. at 301, Gutierrez has never shown Texas\u2019s anti-parties special issue falls \nwithin the ambit of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. In any event, Gutierrez\u2019s claim confuses \nthe concepts of ineligibility for the death penalty and unsuitability for it, and \nDNA testing results that would only affect suitability does not show innocence \nof the death penalty. See Rocha v. Thaler, 626 F.3d 815, 825\u201326 (5th Cir. 2010). \nGutierrez is not entitled to a stay of execution to litigate his time barred \nand meritless claim. The Court should deny his application for a stay of \nexecution. \nC. \nGutierrez fails to prove irreparable injury.  \nGutierrez has litigated and re-litigated his challenges to his conviction \nand sentence for more than two decades. He has failed to identify any error. \nHis procedural due process claim failed to show he was denied any process, and \nhe has repeatedly failed to show he is entitled to postconviction DNA testing. \nThus, his punishment is just, and his execution will be constitutional. \nTherefore, Gutierrez fails to demonstrate any injury, let alone an irreparable \none. \nD. \nThe equities heavily favor Respondents. \n\u201c[T]he State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the \ntimely enforcement of a sentence.\u201d Hill, 547 U.S. at 584. As discussed above, \n\n39 \n \nGutierrez purposefully forewent DNA testing at his trial in 1999, Ex parte \nGutierrez, 337 S.W.3d at 896\u201397, and he has leveraged that strategic decision \nfor the last twenty years to delay enforcement of his sentence, supra note 9. \nRespondents\u2019 and Ms. Harrison\u2019s family\u2019s interest in seeing Gutierrez\u2019s \nsentence enforced far outweigh Gutierrez\u2019s interest in further capitalizing on \nhis decision to forego requesting DNA testing when he should have. \nGutierrez seems to appeal to equity by asserting he \u201cmaintains that he \nneither entered [Ms.] Harrison\u2019s home nor knew anyone would be harmed[.]\u201d \nPet. 5. But that is undermined by his own words. Gutierrez v. State, 2024 WL \n3220514, at *2 (summarizing Gutierrez\u2019s second statement to the police in \nwhich he admitted planning the \u201crip off\u201d of Ms. Harrison, and his third \nstatement in which he admitted to having lied to the police previously and \nexplained that he was inside Ms. Harrison\u2019s home when she was killed and \nthat he gathered Ms. Harrison\u2019s cash). \nLastly, Gutierrez waited eight years after losing in state court in 2011 \nbefore bringing suit in 2019 when he was scheduled to be executed. Gutierrez \nshould not be permitted to capitalize again on his decision not to request DNA \ntesting at his trial, and his dilatory tactics preclude him from showing that \nequity favors a stay of execution. See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Court for N. Dist. of \nCal., 503 U.S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThis claim could have been \n\n40 \n \nbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive \ndelay[.]\u201d). The Court should deny his application for a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n \nGutierrez\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and his application for a stay \nof execution should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nJOSH RENO \nDeputy Attorney General \nFor Criminal Justice \nEDWARD L.

          "task_beliefs": "My prior belief state correctly identified that the dispositive issue in *Gutierrez v. Saenz* is Article III standing, specifically the elements of injury-in-fact and redressability, rather than the merits of the underlying due process claim. I understood the case as a test of federal court jurisdiction over a challenge to state criminal procedures, hinging on the speculative nature of the relief sought.\n\nThe observation of the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits has substantially refined and strengthened this understanding. My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n1.  **The Controlling Precedent is *Reed v. Goertz***: The petitioner's entire legal strategy, as revealed in the brief, is to frame this case as a direct and straightforward application of the Court's very recent decision in *Reed v. Goertz*, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). This is the single most important piece of new information. *Reed* involved a nearly identical fact pattern: a Texas death-row inmate using 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to challenge the constitutionality of the same DNA testing statute (Chapter 64) and naming the prosecutor as the defendant. The Court in *Reed* found the inmate *did* have standing. My predictive model must now be overwhelmingly focused on whether the Justices will see a meaningful distinction between *Reed* and this case. The petitioner argues there is none.\n\n2.  **Clarification of the Injury-in-Fact**: The petitioner explicitly defines the injury as a **procedural due process injury**. The harm is the denial of access to a state-created procedure (DNA testing under Chapter 64) which serves as a gateway to a state-created remedy (a successive habeas petition under Article 11.071 to challenge death-penalty eligibility). The brief powerfully argues, citing a long line of precedent including *Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr.* and *Fuentes v. Shevin*, that for procedural rights, the denial of the procedure *is* the injury. The plaintiff does not need to prove they would ultimately succeed on the merits to have standing to challenge the faulty procedure. This reframes the issue away from the ultimate success of Gutierrez's innocence claim and toward his right to access the process.\n\n3.  **A Multi-Pronged Attack on the Redressability Argument**: My previous belief saw redressability as the petitioner's main hurdle. The brief reveals a sophisticated, multi-layered argument to overcome it:\n    *   **The *Reed* Standard**: The petitioner argues the Fifth Circuit invented a \"novel test\" for redressability that goes far beyond what *Reed* requires. Under *Reed*, a plaintiff need only show it is \"'substantially likely' that the state prosecutor would abide by\" a federal court order. The Fifth Circuit's demand for a \"predictive determination\" that the *specific* officials in *this* case will comply is an incorrect and heightened standard.\n    *   **The Injury is Redressed by the Declaration Itself**: The injury is the denial of access to evidence by the respondents (the DA and Police Chief). A declaratory judgment striking down the statutory basis for their refusal directly redresses that injury by removing the legal barrier. What a different court (the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, or CCA) might do later with the results is a separate matter that does not negate the redressability of the injury caused by *these specific defendants*.\n    *   **The Fifth Circuit Misread State Law**: The petitioner directly attacks the factual premise of the Fifth Circuit's decision. The Fifth Circuit believed a prior CCA ruling made any future claim by Gutierrez futile. The petitioner argues this is wrong because the CCA's prior ruling was based only on the trial record, and it has never considered the DNA evidence *in combination with other new evidence* Gutierrez possesses (e.g., evidence of an alternate suspect). Therefore, the claim is not doomed, and a federal ruling is not futile.\n\n4.  **Strategic Framing of the Legal Question**: The petitioner has framed the \"Question Presented\" to the Court very narrowly: \"Does Article III standing require a particularized determination of whether a specific state official will redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury by following a favorable declaratory judgment?\" This is a direct challenge to the Fifth Circuit's methodology and invites the Supreme Court to simply reaffirm the standard from *Reed* and reverse on that basis, without getting bogged down in the weeds of Texas criminal procedure.\n\nIn sum, my belief state has evolved from a general understanding of a standing problem to a highly specific analysis centered on the application of *Reed v. Goertz*. The petitioner is not asking the Court to break new ground, but to enforce its own recent, on-point precedent against a lower court that allegedly deviated from it. The burden now appears to shift to the respondents to articulate a compelling reason why *Reed* does not control the outcome. My prediction will now hinge on how the Court's majority in *Reed* (Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson, Gorsuch) views the Fifth Circuit's attempt to distinguish this case.",

The respondent, however, introduces a critical new fact: a June 27, 2024, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) ruling that allegedly makes any federal court order futile, thus breaking the chain of redressability. This TCCA ruling is the central pillar of the respondent's argument. To properly evaluate the strength of each side's position, I must now find out how the petitioner responds to this crucial argument. The document that would contain this response is the petitioner's reply to the respondent's brief in opposition.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be refined, moving from a general standing issue to a highly specific conflict over the interpretation of the Court's recent precedent in *Reed v. Goertz*. The observation of the Respondents' Brief in Opposition to Certiorari provides the crucial counter-narrative to the petitioner's arguments and introduces a significant new factual development.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Stable Core Issue**: The central legal question remains Article III standing, and the controlling precedent is undeniably *Reed v. Goertz*. Both parties agree on this; the entire dispute is about whether the Fifth Circuit's ruling was a \"straightforward application\" of *Reed* (Respondents' view) or a \"novel test\" that contradicts *Reed* (Petitioner's view).\n\n2.  **Respondents' Counter-Argument is Revealed**: The Respondents' strategy is not to challenge *Reed* but to distinguish it. Their core argument is that a favorable federal court ruling would be futile, and therefore Gutierrez's injury is not redressable. This argument is built on two pillars:\n    *   **Third-Party Action**: Redressability fails because the ultimate relief Gutierrez seeks (a new sentencing hearing) depends on the independent actions of a third party not before the court\u2014the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA). The Respondents are framing this as a classic standing failure under precedents like *Lujan* and *Franklin v. Massachusetts*.\n    *   **Alignment with Recent Precedent**: The Respondents are strategically citing the Court's most recent, and very restrictive, standing decisions like *TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez*, *FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine*, and *Murthy v. Missouri*. This is a clear signal that they believe the current Court is highly skeptical of claims that rely on speculative, multi-step chains of causation for redressability.\n\n3.  **A Critical New Factual Development**: The Respondents' brief introduces a crucial, time-sensitive piece of evidence: a Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) ruling from June 27, 2024. According to the brief, in this ruling, the TCCA \"reiterat[ed] what the court had held twice before\u2014Gutierrez would not be entitled to DNA testing *even if* Chapter 64 provided for testing for the purpose of affecting one\u2019s punishment.\"\n    *   **Impact on Redressability**: This new fact directly attacks the petitioner's redressability argument. My prior belief noted the petitioner's claim that the TCCA had never considered the DNA evidence in combination with other new evidence. The Respondents now claim the TCCA has effectively done so and has already determined that Gutierrez's claim is meritless under any standard. This transforms the redressability question from a hypothetical (\"what would the TCCA do?\") to a concrete one (\"has the TCCA already foreclosed relief?\").\n    *   **Strengthens the \"Futility\" Argument**: This TCCA ruling is the linchpin of the Respondents' argument that the Fifth Circuit was correct to find the federal lawsuit futile. It provides a concrete, state-law basis for why a federal declaratory judgment would have no practical effect.\n\n4.  **Shift in the Predictive Model**: My predictive model, previously focused on whether the *Reed* majority would see the Fifth Circuit's ruling as a deviation, must now incorporate this new variable. The question is no longer just about the federal standing standard in the abstract. It is now: **Does the Supreme Court believe the June 2024 TCCA ruling definitively breaks the chain of redressability, making this case factually distinct from *Reed*?**\n    *   The petitioner's argument\u2014that the injury is the denial of the *procedure* by the DA and is redressed by an order against the DA\u2014remains intact.\n    *   However, the Respondents' counter\u2014that such an order is meaningless if the ultimate state arbiter has already declared the effort futile\u2014is now backed by very recent state-court action.\n\n5.  **Strategic Framing and Procedural Posture**: I now recognize that the observed document is a \"Brief in Opposition\" to certiorari, not a merits brief. The Respondents' primary goal is to convince the Court not to hear the case at all. They do this by framing the issue as a \"straightforward application\" of existing law to a complex and lengthy case history (\"serial challenges\"), a classic argument against granting review. They also frame Gutierrez as a vexatious litigant to appeal to the Court's interest in finality, especially in capital cases.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved significantly. While the petitioner presented a strong case for a simple reversal under *Reed*, the respondents have introduced a powerful factual counterpoint with the recent TCCA ruling. This ruling sharpens the redressability issue and aligns the respondents' position with the Supreme Court's recent trend of strictly enforcing standing requirements. The case now appears to be a major test of *Reed*'s boundaries when confronted with an intervening and seemingly definitive state court decision. My prediction now hinges heavily on how the Justices weigh the procedural injury against the alleged futility of the ultimate remedy.",

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). BIO 12, \n13, 14, 22, 23. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own opinion belies this assertion. The majority \nopinion acknowledged that by premising Article III standing on the state court record, \nit went well beyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some \npause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining the state court\u2019s \ndecision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3.  \nAs the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, it grafted onto Reed an additional \nrequirement to parse the state court record to predict whether state defendants will \nin fact comply with a declaratory judgment. The ruling below is not a straightforward \napplication of Reed, and it is not the standing analysis performed by the Eighth or \nthe Ninth Circuits. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. \nGuerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nB. \nReed Does Not Require Federal Courts to Scour the State Court \nRecord to Predict Whether State Actors Will Comply with Fed-\neral Declaratory Judgments. \nPicking apart Gutierrez\u2019s state court record with an even finer-toothed comb \nthan the Fifth Circuit, Respondents argue that standing analyses are individualized, \nthat \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross,\u201d and that \u201cstanding must be maintained as \nto each claim.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.  \n\n2 \n \nGutierrez does not dispute that standing depends on the individual plaintiff \nand each of his claims. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis goes far beyond that inquiry \nby resting the redressability determination on the idiosyncratic inclinations of an \nindividual defendant state actor to assess whether that actor will comply with a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. If that were the proper analysis, identically \nsituated plaintiffs would have different standing outcomes depending on the \nidentities, personalities, and politics of Texas officials named as defendants. This \nCourt has never suggested such an inquiry is appropriate. Indeed, just the opposite. \nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (\u201c[W]e may assume it is \nsubstantially likely\u201d that executive officials \u201cwould abide by an authoritative \ninterpretation\u201d of federal law) (emphasis added). \nIt does not help Respondents to cite TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413 \n(2021), and Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801 (June 26, 2024), for \nthe proposition that \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 30. TransUnion \ninvolved a class of 8,185 plaintiffs; the Court held that only the 1,853 class members \nwho had suffered a concrete harm could establish standing, while the other 6,332 \ncould not obtain standing \u201cin gross.\u201d 594 U.S. at 417. Similarly, Murthy involved a \ngroup of plaintiffs\u2014two states and five individuals\u2014who sued \u201cdozens of Executive \nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 2024 WL 3165801, at *4. The Court held that in this \n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d the Fifth Circuit \u201cerred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and \nplatforms each as a unified whole,\u201d id. at *9, and ultimately concluded that plaintiffs \n\n3 \n \nhad not established redressability where the harm was not traceable to defendants \nin the first place, id. at *10\u201316.  \nAgain, Gutierrez does not contest that the standing inquiry must be \nindividually conducted as to him and his claims. But because this Court has already \nheld that an identically situated plaintiff has standing, so too does Gutierrez\u2014just \nlike the 1,853 similarly situated class members in TransUnion. In both Reed and \nGutierrez, the Texas courts denied the prisoner access to physical evidence for DNA \ntesting. In both cases, the physical evidence was retained by state officials who \nrefused to release it for testing. In both cases, the plaintiff sought a federal \ndeclaratory judgment that the Texas framework under which he had been denied \naccess to evidence violates due process. And in both cases the plaintiff has standing \nbecause it is reasonably likely that state officials will comply with a federal judgment \ninstead of violating it. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 513 (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Supreme Court did not say much [in Reed], what it did tell us resolves everything \nwe have to decide here.\u201d). \nC. \nEven under Respondents\u2019 Misguided Record-Scouring Ap-\nproach, the Present Case Is Not Distinguishable from This \nCourt\u2019s Opinion in Reed, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in John-\nson, or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in Redd. \nRespondents attempt to distinguish Reed by citing a footnote from the district \ncourt opinion to argue that, unlike Gutierrez, if Reed were to win a declaratory \njudgment, it would \u201celiminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the \nevidence.\u201d BIO 28\u201329. But Respondents\u2019 argument fails even under the exacting \nreview that its approach requires.  \n\n4 \n \nThe state court in Reed specifically held that unreasonable delay precluded \nReed\u2019s statutory claim for DNA testing\u2014an infirmity independent of his claimed due \nprocess violation concerning the chain of custody requirement. Cert Pet. 18\u201319. \nRespondents now argue that, because Reed also challenged the state court\u2019s delay \nfinding in federal court, a declaratory judgment in his favor would eliminate all the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s justifications for denying access to the evidence: \u201cIf Reed succeeds \non an appeal in showing both the chain-of-custody requirements and the \nunreasonable delay provisions are unconstitutional, the defendant [in Reed] would \nhave nothing to fall back on . . . .\u201d BIO 28. This does not distinguish Reed from \nGutierrez at all.  \nRespondents\u2019 own argument to the Fifth Circuit in Reed characterized his \nunreasonable delay challenge just as they now characterize Gutierrez\u2019s innocence-of-\nthe-death-penalty challenge:  \nThe CCA applied a case-specific review to determine whether Reed\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion was timely. The court specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014Reed\u2019s assertion that he could not have sought touch DNA \ntesting earlier than he did. Reed\u2019s disagreement with the CCA\u2019s \nconclusions belies any assertions that he is making a broad attack on \nthe constitutionality of Chapter 64\u2019s procedures. Instead, he merely \ndisagreed with the CCA\u2019s fact findings and conclusions founded upon \nthose facts.  \n \nAppellee\u2019s Br., Reed v. Goertz, No. 19-70022 (5th Cir.), Doc. 38-1 at 31 (Feb. 24, 2020) \n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted). This is the same argument that \nRespondents make here: \u201cthat because the state court has already spoken on the very \ndefect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, Gutierrez \nlacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment.\u201d BIO 12. In effect, Respondents \n\n5 \n \nargue that states can preclude redressability, and thereby defeat federal standing, by \ndenying relief under a statute alleged to be unconstitutional. Letting states \npredetermine such a purely federal question would turn Article III standing on its \nhead.     \n \nEqually unavailing is Respondents\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Johnson. Respondents argue that in Johnson, \u201c[t]he plaintiff alleged in \nfederal court that Arkansas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively \nconstrued, violated his constitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality \nstandard.\u201d BIO 31. They go on to argue that \u201ca favorable judgment in federal court \nwould have, in fact, eliminated the justification for refusing access to evidence for \ntesting based on the challenged provision of state law.\u201d Id. This analysis misstates \nthe circumstances of Johnson.  \nJohnson\u2019s claim was that the Arkansas statute violated due process by \nrequiring him to prove his innocence in order to obtain the very DNA evidence that \nwould prove his innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 510 (explaining that Johnson \n\u201calleges that Arkansas courts have arbitrarily denied him the very right to DNA \ntesting that [the statute] purports to create\u201d) (quotation omitted). The Arkansas \nSupreme Court in Johnson thus did virtually the same thing the CCA did in \nGutierrez\u2019s case. See Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 271\u201372 (Ark. 2019). The court \nconcluded: \u201c[N]one of the evidence that might result from the proposed testing could \nadvance Johnson\u2019s claim of actual innocence or raise a reasonable probability that he \ndid not murder Carol Heath.\u201d Id. In other words, even if the constitutional infirmity \n\n6 \n \nthat Johnson alleged were cured, and he got the testing he wanted, the Arkansas \ncourt said his request for relief would still fail because the results would not establish \na reasonable probability that he did not commit the murder. And the court said so \nwith considerably more reasoning than the conclusory opinion by the CCA here. See \nA79\u2013A80. \nNone of this was lost on the Eighth Circuit, which recited the Arkansas \nSupreme Court\u2019s holding that the evidence sought by Johnson would not tend to show \nhis innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 509. The Eighth Circuit nevertheless applied \nReed to hold that Johnson had standing because a declaratory judgment would \n\u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood that state officials would relinquish the \nevidence. Id. at 511\u201312. There is simply no way to reconcile the standing analysis in \nReed and Johnson with the analysis undertaken below. \nRespondents also fail in their attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Redd, urging that the case did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute. BIO 13 n.7, 32. This difference is irrelevant. Nothing in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standing test would limit it to DNA challenges. Private parties \nfrequently seek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are \nnot directly obligated to comply with their terms. Redd specifically referred to this \nCourt\u2019s standing analysis in Reed to determine that Redd had standing. See 84 F.4th \nat 884. The Ninth Circuit did not parse the record of state court proceedings to \nforecast how the specific defendants would respond to a declaratory judgment. The \ncourt instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was similarly situated \n\n7 \n \nto Reed. Id. A declaratory judgment would change the legal relationship between the \nparties, with the \u201cpractical consequence\u201d of a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d \nthat the defendants would afford plaintiff the relief he sought. Id. (quoting Reed, 598 \nU.S. at 238). Far from parsing every jot and tittle of the parties\u2019 legal history, the \nNinth Circuit followed this Court\u2019s guidance and \u201cassumed it is substantially likely\u201d \nthat state officials would comply with a federal court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative interpretation\u201d \nof federal constitutional law. Id. at 885 (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 808).  \nThe circuit split created by the Fifth Circuit is not confined to DNA cases, and \nwill undoubtedly grow if not addressed by this Court. Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly had to correct the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standing decisions in recent years. See \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659 (2021); FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. 367 (2024); Murthy, --- S.Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801. In this case, the Fifth \nCircuit has failed in its obligation to \u201calways hear the case of a litigant who asserts \nthe violation of a legal right.\u201d A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, 885 (1983). This Court \nshould grant certiorari and restore declaratory judgment standing to its \nstraightforward pre-Gutierrez status. \nII. \nTHE COURT SHOULD STAY GUTIERREZ\u2019S EXECUTION.  \nGutierrez satisfies all the requirements for a stay: he has shown likely success \non the merits, he did not bring his claim for purposes of delay, and he will suffer \nirreparable injury absent a stay. \n \n\n8 \n \nA. \nGutierrez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \nGutierrez is likely to prevail on the merits. This Court\u2019s decision in Reed, its \nother standing jurisprudence, and the weight of authority from the United States \nCourts of Appeals establish that Gutierrez\u2014just like other state prisoners \nchallenging the constitutionality of post-conviction relief statutes\u2014has standing to \nallege that Chapter 64 violates due process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling stands \nalone by adding a new barrier to federal standing, one that, perversely, invites state \nofficial defendants to preclude Article III standing merely by disclaiming \nredressability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel test is likely to be overturned on review.  \nMoreover, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 64 \nhas merit. The substantive rights respectively created by Article 11.071 and Chapter \n64 are protected by procedural due process. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third \nJudicial District v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 68 (2009) (holding that a criminal defendant \nhas a \u201cliberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state \nlaw\u201d). But, as the district court in this case observed, these two statutory provisions \nare irreconcilable: A person sentenced to death in Texas cannot meet the threshold \nshowing required to file a habeas petition under Article 11.071\u2014that is, he cannot \nshow he is ineligible for the death penalty\u2014because that person cannot obtain DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 to establish that he is ineligible for the death penalty. \nAlthough there is no freestanding substantive \u201cright to collateral proceedings \nat all,\u201d BIO 37, a state\u2019s DNA procedures nevertheless must comply with baseline \nconstitutional protections, Osborne, 557 U.S. at 52. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that Article 11.071 does not codify the Sawyer doctrine on \u201cactual \n\n9 \n \ninnocence\u201d of the death penalty, BIO 37, is erroneous. The CCA has stated explicitly \nthat \u201cSection 5(a)(3) of Article 11.071 represents the Legislature\u2019s attempt to codify \nsomething very much like this federal doctrine of \u2018actual innocence of the death \npenalty\u2019 for purposes of subsequent state writs.\u201d Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \nRespondents\u2019 argument about \u201cineligibility\u201d versus \u201cunsuitability\u201d for the \ndeath penalty is confusing at best and does not cast doubt on the merit of Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim. BIO 38. Gutierrez does not dispute that evidence demonstrating ineligibility \nfor the death penalty is different from additional mitigation evidence that might \nimpact a jury\u2019s discretion to impose death. This case involves the former type of \nevidence. Gutierrez seeks to obtain DNA evidence that would show he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty because he does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of \nArticle 37.071, which requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe \ndefendant actually caused the death of the decedent or did not actually cause the \ndeath of the deceased but intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human \nlife would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2); see \u00a7 37.071(c) (\u201cThe \nstate must prove each issue submitted under Subsection (b) of this article beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on each \nissue submitted under Subsection (b) of this Article.\u201d). DNA evidence that identifies \nperpetrators but excludes Gutierrez would establish that Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not participate in the murder. \nThis evidence thus would show that Gutierrez had not \u201cactually caused the death of \n\n10 \n \nthe decedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2). \nB. \nGutierrez Has Not Delayed in Bringing His Claim.  \nAs Respondents acknowledge, this Court held in Reed that the two-year statute \nof limitations on Reed\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim began to run \u201cwhen the state litigation ended \nand deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at \n236. Specifically, \u201cthe state litigation ended . . . when the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals denied Reed\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d Id. Here, Gutierrez\u2019s state litigation \nended when the CCA affirmed the denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing on \nFebruary 26, 2020. A62. Gutierrez timely filed his \u00a7 1983 claim in the district court \nwell before that date, on September 26, 2019. \nRespondents argue that the state litigation ended not in 2020, but instead in \n2011 when the CCA affirmed the denial of an earlier request for DNA testing. BIO \n35. That prior request, however, is not the operative request. The operative request \nis Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request for DNA testing because it was based on new legal and \nfactual grounds arising after Gutierrez\u2019s prior request was denied.  \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was based on an amended version of Chapter 64; \nunlike his earlier request, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request came after Chapter 64 was \namended to eliminate the \u201cat fault\u201d provision of the prior statute. That provision, \nwhich required a defendant to show that the absence of DNA testing at the time of \ntrial was \u201cthrough no fault of the convicted person,\u201d formed part of the basis for the \ntrial court\u2019s previous denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing. See A48, A53. The \n\u201cat fault\u201d provision was removed when the statute was amended, thereby removing \n\n11 \n \nthat rationale for denying Gutierrez\u2019s request. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. \n64.01(b)(1)(B) (West 2017). \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on new facts and evidence. Prior to \n2019, Respondents denied having custody of the hair found in the decedent\u2019s hand. \nAfter undersigned counsel\u2019s repeated requests to examine physical evidence in the \nState\u2019s possession, the State made the evidence available for review on May 21, 2019. \nUpon review of the evidence, counsel discovered that the hair was in fact preserved \nin a sealed envelope in the district attorney\u2019s files. Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion thus \nrequested testing of the newly discovered hair\u2014a critical piece of evidence in light of \nthe evidence at trial suggesting that the decedent had struggled with her assailant(s).  \nFurther, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on recent advances in DNA \ntesting that have increased the likelihood of obtaining DNA evidence from the items \nin question. These advances allow for obtaining DNA samples even from small, \ndamaged, or degraded samples. For instance, under earlier testing methods, the hair \nfound in the decedent\u2019s hand would need to contain a root in order to yield a DNA \nprofile, whereas a genetic profile can now be obtained using mitochondrial DNA \ntesting even without a root. New developments in DNA technology also make it \nreasonably likely that testing could yield touch DNA left on the decedent\u2019s nightgown \nby her assailant(s). Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion requested testing based on these recent \nadvances in DNA science.  \n \nBecause the 2019 request was based on both new legal and new factual \ndevelopments, it presented a separate and distinct request for testing. The CCA \n\n12 \n \nevidently viewed it that way, as it addressed and ruled on the merits of the new issues \nraised in the 2019 motion.1 See A70\u2013A80. The denial of the 2019 request thus \ninitiated a new accrual period. Gutierrez timely brought his claim within that new \naccrual period and has not delayed pursuit of this claim. This case comes before the \nCourt under the time constraints of an impending execution not because of any action \nby Gutierrez, but because the State sought an execution date while this matter was \nstill in active litigation. \nC. \nGutierrez Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay. \nThroughout his trial and in the proceedings since, Gutierrez has maintained \nthat he did not kill Escolastica Harrison, and that he had no knowledge that others \nwere going to assault or kill her. None of the items collected during the investigation \nof this case has ever been subjected to DNA testing. Absent a stay and grant of \ncertiorari, Gutierrez faces not only the denial of process that he has repeatedly and \nconsistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution. \n \n \n \n \n1 The trial court initially granted the 2019 request. One week later, however, the \ntrial court filed two orders: one order withdrawing the order granting DNA testing, \nand another order denying the 2019 request. A59\u2013A61. \n\n13 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should issue a writ of certiorari and \nstay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court\n\n35: 20240711155958615_24-07-11_CertReply.json (score: 0.502)\nOCTOBER TERM, 2023 \n \nNos. 23-7809, 23A1160 \n_______________________________ \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_______________________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLUIS V.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). BIO 12, \n13, 14, 22, 23. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own opinion belies this assertion. The majority \nopinion acknowledged that by premising Article III standing on the state court record, \nit went well beyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some \npause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining the state court\u2019s \ndecision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3.  \nAs the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, it grafted onto Reed an additional \nrequirement to parse the state court record to predict whether state defendants will \nin fact comply with a declaratory judgment. The ruling below is not a straightforward \napplication of Reed, and it is not the standing analysis performed by the Eighth or \nthe Ninth Circuits. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. \nGuerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nB. \nReed Does Not Require Federal Courts to Scour the State Court \nRecord to Predict Whether State Actors Will Comply with Fed-\neral Declaratory Judgments. \nPicking apart Gutierrez\u2019s state court record with an even finer-toothed comb \nthan the Fifth Circuit, Respondents argue that standing analyses are individualized, \nthat \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross,\u201d and that \u201cstanding must be maintained as \nto each claim.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.  \n\n2 \n \nGutierrez does not dispute that standing depends on the individual plaintiff \nand each of his claims. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis goes far beyond that inquiry \nby resting the redressability determination on the idiosyncratic inclinations of an \nindividual defendant state actor to assess whether that actor will comply with a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. If that were the proper analysis, identically \nsituated plaintiffs would have different standing outcomes depending on the \nidentities, personalities, and politics of Texas officials named as defendants. This \nCourt has never suggested such an inquiry is appropriate. Indeed, just the opposite. \nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (\u201c[W]e may assume it is \nsubstantially likely\u201d that executive officials \u201cwould abide by an authoritative \ninterpretation\u201d of federal law) (emphasis added). \nIt does not help Respondents to cite TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413 \n(2021), and Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801 (June 26, 2024), for \nthe proposition that \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 30. TransUnion \ninvolved a class of 8,185 plaintiffs; the Court held that only the 1,853 class members \nwho had suffered a concrete harm could establish standing, while the other 6,332 \ncould not obtain standing \u201cin gross.\u201d 594 U.S. at 417. Similarly, Murthy involved a \ngroup of plaintiffs\u2014two states and five individuals\u2014who sued \u201cdozens of Executive \nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 2024 WL 3165801, at *4. The Court held that in this \n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d the Fifth Circuit \u201cerred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and \nplatforms each as a unified whole,\u201d id. at *9, and ultimately concluded that plaintiffs \n\n3 \n \nhad not established redressability where the harm was not traceable to defendants \nin the first place, id. at *10\u201316.  \nAgain, Gutierrez does not contest that the standing inquiry must be \nindividually conducted as to him and his claims. But because this Court has already \nheld that an identically situated plaintiff has standing, so too does Gutierrez\u2014just \nlike the 1,853 similarly situated class members in TransUnion. In both Reed and \nGutierrez, the Texas courts denied the prisoner access to physical evidence for DNA \ntesting. In both cases, the physical evidence was retained by state officials who \nrefused to release it for testing. In both cases, the plaintiff sought a federal \ndeclaratory judgment that the Texas framework under which he had been denied \naccess to evidence violates due process. And in both cases the plaintiff has standing \nbecause it is reasonably likely that state officials will comply with a federal judgment \ninstead of violating it. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 513 (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Supreme Court did not say much [in Reed], what it did tell us resolves everything \nwe have to decide here.\u201d). \nC. \nEven under Respondents\u2019 Misguided Record-Scouring Ap-\nproach, the Present Case Is Not Distinguishable from This \nCourt\u2019s Opinion in Reed, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in John-\nson, or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in Redd. \nRespondents attempt to distinguish Reed by citing a footnote from the district \ncourt opinion to argue that, unlike Gutierrez, if Reed were to win a declaratory \njudgment, it would \u201celiminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the \nevidence.\u201d BIO 28\u201329. But Respondents\u2019 argument fails even under the exacting \nreview that its approach requires.  \n\n4 \n \nThe state court in Reed specifically held that unreasonable delay precluded \nReed\u2019s statutory claim for DNA testing\u2014an infirmity independent of his claimed due \nprocess violation concerning the chain of custody requirement. Cert Pet. 18\u201319. \nRespondents now argue that, because Reed also challenged the state court\u2019s delay \nfinding in federal court, a declaratory judgment in his favor would eliminate all the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s justifications for denying access to the evidence: \u201cIf Reed succeeds \non an appeal in showing both the chain-of-custody requirements and the \nunreasonable delay provisions are unconstitutional, the defendant [in Reed] would \nhave nothing to fall back on . . . .\u201d BIO 28. This does not distinguish Reed from \nGutierrez at all.  \nRespondents\u2019 own argument to the Fifth Circuit in Reed characterized his \nunreasonable delay challenge just as they now characterize Gutierrez\u2019s innocence-of-\nthe-death-penalty challenge:  \nThe CCA applied a case-specific review to determine whether Reed\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion was timely. The court specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014Reed\u2019s assertion that he could not have sought touch DNA \ntesting earlier than he did. Reed\u2019s disagreement with the CCA\u2019s \nconclusions belies any assertions that he is making a broad attack on \nthe constitutionality of Chapter 64\u2019s procedures. Instead, he merely \ndisagreed with the CCA\u2019s fact findings and conclusions founded upon \nthose facts.  \n \nAppellee\u2019s Br., Reed v. Goertz, No. 19-70022 (5th Cir.), Doc. 38-1 at 31 (Feb. 24, 2020) \n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted). This is the same argument that \nRespondents make here: \u201cthat because the state court has already spoken on the very \ndefect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, Gutierrez \nlacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment.\u201d BIO 12. In effect, Respondents \n\n5 \n \nargue that states can preclude redressability, and thereby defeat federal standing, by \ndenying relief under a statute alleged to be unconstitutional. Letting states \npredetermine such a purely federal question would turn Article III standing on its \nhead.     \n \nEqually unavailing is Respondents\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Johnson. Respondents argue that in Johnson, \u201c[t]he plaintiff alleged in \nfederal court that Arkansas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively \nconstrued, violated his constitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality \nstandard.\u201d BIO 31. They go on to argue that \u201ca favorable judgment in federal court \nwould have, in fact, eliminated the justification for refusing access to evidence for \ntesting based on the challenged provision of state law.\u201d Id. This analysis misstates \nthe circumstances of Johnson.  \nJohnson\u2019s claim was that the Arkansas statute violated due process by \nrequiring him to prove his innocence in order to obtain the very DNA evidence that \nwould prove his innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 510 (explaining that Johnson \n\u201calleges that Arkansas courts have arbitrarily denied him the very right to DNA \ntesting that [the statute] purports to create\u201d) (quotation omitted). The Arkansas \nSupreme Court in Johnson thus did virtually the same thing the CCA did in \nGutierrez\u2019s case. See Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 271\u201372 (Ark. 2019). The court \nconcluded: \u201c[N]one of the evidence that might result from the proposed testing could \nadvance Johnson\u2019s claim of actual innocence or raise a reasonable probability that he \ndid not murder Carol Heath.\u201d Id. In other words, even if the constitutional infirmity \n\n6 \n \nthat Johnson alleged were cured, and he got the testing he wanted, the Arkansas \ncourt said his request for relief would still fail because the results would not establish \na reasonable probability that he did not commit the murder. And the court said so \nwith considerably more reasoning than the conclusory opinion by the CCA here. See \nA79\u2013A80. \nNone of this was lost on the Eighth Circuit, which recited the Arkansas \nSupreme Court\u2019s holding that the evidence sought by Johnson would not tend to show \nhis innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 509. The Eighth Circuit nevertheless applied \nReed to hold that Johnson had standing because a declaratory judgment would \n\u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood that state officials would relinquish the \nevidence. Id. at 511\u201312. There is simply no way to reconcile the standing analysis in \nReed and Johnson with the analysis undertaken below. \nRespondents also fail in their attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Redd, urging that the case did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute. BIO 13 n.7, 32. This difference is irrelevant. Nothing in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standing test would limit it to DNA challenges. Private parties \nfrequently seek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are \nnot directly obligated to comply with their terms. Redd specifically referred to this \nCourt\u2019s standing analysis in Reed to determine that Redd had standing. See 84 F.4th \nat 884. The Ninth Circuit did not parse the record of state court proceedings to \nforecast how the specific defendants would respond to a declaratory judgment. The \ncourt instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was similarly situated \n\n7 \n \nto Reed. Id. A declaratory judgment would change the legal relationship between the \nparties, with the \u201cpractical consequence\u201d of a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d \nthat the defendants would afford plaintiff the relief he sought. Id. (quoting Reed, 598 \nU.S. at 238). Far from parsing every jot and tittle of the parties\u2019 legal history, the \nNinth Circuit followed this Court\u2019s guidance and \u201cassumed it is substantially likely\u201d \nthat state officials would comply with a federal court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative interpretation\u201d \nof federal constitutional law. Id. at 885 (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 808).  \nThe circuit split created by the Fifth Circuit is not confined to DNA cases, and \nwill undoubtedly grow if not addressed by this Court. Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly had to correct the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standing decisions in recent years. See \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659 (2021); FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. 367 (2024); Murthy, --- S.Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801. In this case, the Fifth \nCircuit has failed in its obligation to \u201calways hear the case of a litigant who asserts \nthe violation of a legal right.\u201d A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, 885 (1983). This Court \nshould grant certiorari and restore declaratory judgment standing to its \nstraightforward pre-Gutierrez status. \nII. \nTHE COURT SHOULD STAY GUTIERREZ\u2019S EXECUTION.  \nGutierrez satisfies all the requirements for a stay: he has shown likely success \non the merits, he did not bring his claim for purposes of delay, and he will suffer \nirreparable injury absent a stay. \n \n\n8 \n \nA. \nGutierrez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \nGutierrez is likely to prevail on the merits. This Court\u2019s decision in Reed, its \nother standing jurisprudence, and the weight of authority from the United States \nCourts of Appeals establish that Gutierrez\u2014just like other state prisoners \nchallenging the constitutionality of post-conviction relief statutes\u2014has standing to \nallege that Chapter 64 violates due process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling stands \nalone by adding a new barrier to federal standing, one that, perversely, invites state \nofficial defendants to preclude Article III standing merely by disclaiming \nredressability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel test is likely to be overturned on review.  \nMoreover, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 64 \nhas merit. The substantive rights respectively created by Article 11.071 and Chapter \n64 are protected by procedural due process. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third \nJudicial District v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 68 (2009) (holding that a criminal defendant \nhas a \u201cliberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state \nlaw\u201d). But, as the district court in this case observed, these two statutory provisions \nare irreconcilable: A person sentenced to death in Texas cannot meet the threshold \nshowing required to file a habeas petition under Article 11.071\u2014that is, he cannot \nshow he is ineligible for the death penalty\u2014because that person cannot obtain DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 to establish that he is ineligible for the death penalty. \nAlthough there is no freestanding substantive \u201cright to collateral proceedings \nat all,\u201d BIO 37, a state\u2019s DNA procedures nevertheless must comply with baseline \nconstitutional protections, Osborne, 557 U.S. at 52. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that Article 11.071 does not codify the Sawyer doctrine on \u201cactual \n\n9 \n \ninnocence\u201d of the death penalty, BIO 37, is erroneous. The CCA has stated explicitly \nthat \u201cSection 5(a)(3) of Article 11.071 represents the Legislature\u2019s attempt to codify \nsomething very much like this federal doctrine of \u2018actual innocence of the death \npenalty\u2019 for purposes of subsequent state writs.\u201d Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \nRespondents\u2019 argument about \u201cineligibility\u201d versus \u201cunsuitability\u201d for the \ndeath penalty is confusing at best and does not cast doubt on the merit of Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim. BIO 38. Gutierrez does not dispute that evidence demonstrating ineligibility \nfor the death penalty is different from additional mitigation evidence that might \nimpact a jury\u2019s discretion to impose death. This case involves the former type of \nevidence. Gutierrez seeks to obtain DNA evidence that would show he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty because he does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of \nArticle 37.071, which requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe \ndefendant actually caused the death of the decedent or did not actually cause the \ndeath of the deceased but intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human \nlife would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2); see \u00a7 37.071(c) (\u201cThe \nstate must prove each issue submitted under Subsection (b) of this article beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on each \nissue submitted under Subsection (b) of this Article.\u201d). DNA evidence that identifies \nperpetrators but excludes Gutierrez would establish that Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not participate in the murder. \nThis evidence thus would show that Gutierrez had not \u201cactually caused the death of \n\n10 \n \nthe decedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2). \nB. \nGutierrez Has Not Delayed in Bringing His Claim.  \nAs Respondents acknowledge, this Court held in Reed that the two-year statute \nof limitations on Reed\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim began to run \u201cwhen the state litigation ended \nand deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at \n236. Specifically, \u201cthe state litigation ended . . . when the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals denied Reed\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d Id. Here, Gutierrez\u2019s state litigation \nended when the CCA affirmed the denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing on \nFebruary 26, 2020. A62. Gutierrez timely filed his \u00a7 1983 claim in the district court \nwell before that date, on September 26, 2019. \nRespondents argue that the state litigation ended not in 2020, but instead in \n2011 when the CCA affirmed the denial of an earlier request for DNA testing. BIO \n35. That prior request, however, is not the operative request. The operative request \nis Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request for DNA testing because it was based on new legal and \nfactual grounds arising after Gutierrez\u2019s prior request was denied.  \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was based on an amended version of Chapter 64; \nunlike his earlier request, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request came after Chapter 64 was \namended to eliminate the \u201cat fault\u201d provision of the prior statute. That provision, \nwhich required a defendant to show that the absence of DNA testing at the time of \ntrial was \u201cthrough no fault of the convicted person,\u201d formed part of the basis for the \ntrial court\u2019s previous denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing. See A48, A53. The \n\u201cat fault\u201d provision was removed when the statute was amended, thereby removing \n\n11 \n \nthat rationale for denying Gutierrez\u2019s request. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. \n64.01(b)(1)(B) (West 2017). \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on new facts and evidence. Prior to \n2019, Respondents denied having custody of the hair found in the decedent\u2019s hand. \nAfter undersigned counsel\u2019s repeated requests to examine physical evidence in the \nState\u2019s possession, the State made the evidence available for review on May 21, 2019. \nUpon review of the evidence, counsel discovered that the hair was in fact preserved \nin a sealed envelope in the district attorney\u2019s files. Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion thus \nrequested testing of the newly discovered hair\u2014a critical piece of evidence in light of \nthe evidence at trial suggesting that the decedent had struggled with her assailant(s).  \nFurther, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on recent advances in DNA \ntesting that have increased the likelihood of obtaining DNA evidence from the items \nin question. These advances allow for obtaining DNA samples even from small, \ndamaged, or degraded samples. For instance, under earlier testing methods, the hair \nfound in the decedent\u2019s hand would need to contain a root in order to yield a DNA \nprofile, whereas a genetic profile can now be obtained using mitochondrial DNA \ntesting even without a root. New developments in DNA technology also make it \nreasonably likely that testing could yield touch DNA left on the decedent\u2019s nightgown \nby her assailant(s). Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion requested testing based on these recent \nadvances in DNA science.  \n \nBecause the 2019 request was based on both new legal and new factual \ndevelopments, it presented a separate and distinct request for testing. The CCA \n\n12 \n \nevidently viewed it that way, as it addressed and ruled on the merits of the new issues \nraised in the 2019 motion.1 See A70\u2013A80. The denial of the 2019 request thus \ninitiated a new accrual period. Gutierrez timely brought his claim within that new \naccrual period and has not delayed pursuit of this claim. This case comes before the \nCourt under the time constraints of an impending execution not because of any action \nby Gutierrez, but because the State sought an execution date while this matter was \nstill in active litigation. \nC. \nGutierrez Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay. \nThroughout his trial and in the proceedings since, Gutierrez has maintained \nthat he did not kill Escolastica Harrison, and that he had no knowledge that others \nwere going to assault or kill her. None of the items collected during the investigation \nof this case has ever been subjected to DNA testing. Absent a stay and grant of \ncertiorari, Gutierrez faces not only the denial of process that he has repeatedly and \nconsistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution. \n \n \n \n \n1 The trial court initially granted the 2019 request. One week later, however, the \ntrial court filed two orders: one order withdrawing the order granting DNA testing, \nand another order denying the 2019 request. A59\u2013A61. \n\n13 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should issue a writ of certiorari and \nstay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court\n\n21: 20240711160011138_24-07-11_ProofOfService.json (score: 0.448)\nOCTOBER TERM, 2023 \n \nNos. 23-7809, 28A1160 \n_______________________________ \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_______________________________ \n \nRUBEN GUTIERREZ, \nPetitioner, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLUIS V.

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). BIO 12, \n13, 14, 22, 23. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own opinion belies this assertion. The majority \nopinion acknowledged that by premising Article III standing on the state court record, \nit went well beyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some \npause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining the state court\u2019s \ndecision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3.  \nAs the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, it grafted onto Reed an additional \nrequirement to parse the state court record to predict whether state defendants will \nin fact comply with a declaratory judgment. The ruling below is not a straightforward \napplication of Reed, and it is not the standing analysis performed by the Eighth or \nthe Ninth Circuits. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. \nGuerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nB. \nReed Does Not Require Federal Courts to Scour the State Court \nRecord to Predict Whether State Actors Will Comply with Fed-\neral Declaratory Judgments. \nPicking apart Gutierrez\u2019s state court record with an even finer-toothed comb \nthan the Fifth Circuit, Respondents argue that standing analyses are individualized, \nthat \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross,\u201d and that \u201cstanding must be maintained as \nto each claim.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.  \n\n2 \n \nGutierrez does not dispute that standing depends on the individual plaintiff \nand each of his claims. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis goes far beyond that inquiry \nby resting the redressability determination on the idiosyncratic inclinations of an \nindividual defendant state actor to assess whether that actor will comply with a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. If that were the proper analysis, identically \nsituated plaintiffs would have different standing outcomes depending on the \nidentities, personalities, and politics of Texas officials named as defendants. This \nCourt has never suggested such an inquiry is appropriate. Indeed, just the opposite. \nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (\u201c[W]e may assume it is \nsubstantially likely\u201d that executive officials \u201cwould abide by an authoritative \ninterpretation\u201d of federal law) (emphasis added). \nIt does not help Respondents to cite TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413 \n(2021), and Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801 (June 26, 2024), for \nthe proposition that \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 30. TransUnion \ninvolved a class of 8,185 plaintiffs; the Court held that only the 1,853 class members \nwho had suffered a concrete harm could establish standing, while the other 6,332 \ncould not obtain standing \u201cin gross.\u201d 594 U.S. at 417. Similarly, Murthy involved a \ngroup of plaintiffs\u2014two states and five individuals\u2014who sued \u201cdozens of Executive \nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 2024 WL 3165801, at *4. The Court held that in this \n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d the Fifth Circuit \u201cerred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and \nplatforms each as a unified whole,\u201d id. at *9, and ultimately concluded that plaintiffs \n\n3 \n \nhad not established redressability where the harm was not traceable to defendants \nin the first place, id. at *10\u201316.  \nAgain, Gutierrez does not contest that the standing inquiry must be \nindividually conducted as to him and his claims. But because this Court has already \nheld that an identically situated plaintiff has standing, so too does Gutierrez\u2014just \nlike the 1,853 similarly situated class members in TransUnion. In both Reed and \nGutierrez, the Texas courts denied the prisoner access to physical evidence for DNA \ntesting. In both cases, the physical evidence was retained by state officials who \nrefused to release it for testing. In both cases, the plaintiff sought a federal \ndeclaratory judgment that the Texas framework under which he had been denied \naccess to evidence violates due process. And in both cases the plaintiff has standing \nbecause it is reasonably likely that state officials will comply with a federal judgment \ninstead of violating it. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 513 (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Supreme Court did not say much [in Reed], what it did tell us resolves everything \nwe have to decide here.\u201d). \nC. \nEven under Respondents\u2019 Misguided Record-Scouring Ap-\nproach, the Present Case Is Not Distinguishable from This \nCourt\u2019s Opinion in Reed, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in John-\nson, or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in Redd. \nRespondents attempt to distinguish Reed by citing a footnote from the district \ncourt opinion to argue that, unlike Gutierrez, if Reed were to win a declaratory \njudgment, it would \u201celiminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the \nevidence.\u201d BIO 28\u201329. But Respondents\u2019 argument fails even under the exacting \nreview that its approach requires.  \n\n4 \n \nThe state court in Reed specifically held that unreasonable delay precluded \nReed\u2019s statutory claim for DNA testing\u2014an infirmity independent of his claimed due \nprocess violation concerning the chain of custody requirement. Cert Pet. 18\u201319. \nRespondents now argue that, because Reed also challenged the state court\u2019s delay \nfinding in federal court, a declaratory judgment in his favor would eliminate all the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s justifications for denying access to the evidence: \u201cIf Reed succeeds \non an appeal in showing both the chain-of-custody requirements and the \nunreasonable delay provisions are unconstitutional, the defendant [in Reed] would \nhave nothing to fall back on . . . .\u201d BIO 28. This does not distinguish Reed from \nGutierrez at all.  \nRespondents\u2019 own argument to the Fifth Circuit in Reed characterized his \nunreasonable delay challenge just as they now characterize Gutierrez\u2019s innocence-of-\nthe-death-penalty challenge:  \nThe CCA applied a case-specific review to determine whether Reed\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion was timely. The court specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014Reed\u2019s assertion that he could not have sought touch DNA \ntesting earlier than he did. Reed\u2019s disagreement with the CCA\u2019s \nconclusions belies any assertions that he is making a broad attack on \nthe constitutionality of Chapter 64\u2019s procedures. Instead, he merely \ndisagreed with the CCA\u2019s fact findings and conclusions founded upon \nthose facts.  \n \nAppellee\u2019s Br., Reed v. Goertz, No. 19-70022 (5th Cir.), Doc. 38-1 at 31 (Feb. 24, 2020) \n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted). This is the same argument that \nRespondents make here: \u201cthat because the state court has already spoken on the very \ndefect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, Gutierrez \nlacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment.\u201d BIO 12. In effect, Respondents \n\n5 \n \nargue that states can preclude redressability, and thereby defeat federal standing, by \ndenying relief under a statute alleged to be unconstitutional. Letting states \npredetermine such a purely federal question would turn Article III standing on its \nhead.     \n \nEqually unavailing is Respondents\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Johnson. Respondents argue that in Johnson, \u201c[t]he plaintiff alleged in \nfederal court that Arkansas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively \nconstrued, violated his constitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality \nstandard.\u201d BIO 31. They go on to argue that \u201ca favorable judgment in federal court \nwould have, in fact, eliminated the justification for refusing access to evidence for \ntesting based on the challenged provision of state law.\u201d Id. This analysis misstates \nthe circumstances of Johnson.  \nJohnson\u2019s claim was that the Arkansas statute violated due process by \nrequiring him to prove his innocence in order to obtain the very DNA evidence that \nwould prove his innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 510 (explaining that Johnson \n\u201calleges that Arkansas courts have arbitrarily denied him the very right to DNA \ntesting that [the statute] purports to create\u201d) (quotation omitted). The Arkansas \nSupreme Court in Johnson thus did virtually the same thing the CCA did in \nGutierrez\u2019s case. See Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 271\u201372 (Ark. 2019). The court \nconcluded: \u201c[N]one of the evidence that might result from the proposed testing could \nadvance Johnson\u2019s claim of actual innocence or raise a reasonable probability that he \ndid not murder Carol Heath.\u201d Id. In other words, even if the constitutional infirmity \n\n6 \n \nthat Johnson alleged were cured, and he got the testing he wanted, the Arkansas \ncourt said his request for relief would still fail because the results would not establish \na reasonable probability that he did not commit the murder. And the court said so \nwith considerably more reasoning than the conclusory opinion by the CCA here. See \nA79\u2013A80. \nNone of this was lost on the Eighth Circuit, which recited the Arkansas \nSupreme Court\u2019s holding that the evidence sought by Johnson would not tend to show \nhis innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 509. The Eighth Circuit nevertheless applied \nReed to hold that Johnson had standing because a declaratory judgment would \n\u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood that state officials would relinquish the \nevidence. Id. at 511\u201312. There is simply no way to reconcile the standing analysis in \nReed and Johnson with the analysis undertaken below. \nRespondents also fail in their attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Redd, urging that the case did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute. BIO 13 n.7, 32. This difference is irrelevant. Nothing in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standing test would limit it to DNA challenges. Private parties \nfrequently seek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are \nnot directly obligated to comply with their terms. Redd specifically referred to this \nCourt\u2019s standing analysis in Reed to determine that Redd had standing. See 84 F.4th \nat 884. The Ninth Circuit did not parse the record of state court proceedings to \nforecast how the specific defendants would respond to a declaratory judgment. The \ncourt instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was similarly situated \n\n7 \n \nto Reed. Id. A declaratory judgment would change the legal relationship between the \nparties, with the \u201cpractical consequence\u201d of a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d \nthat the defendants would afford plaintiff the relief he sought. Id. (quoting Reed, 598 \nU.S. at 238). Far from parsing every jot and tittle of the parties\u2019 legal history, the \nNinth Circuit followed this Court\u2019s guidance and \u201cassumed it is substantially likely\u201d \nthat state officials would comply with a federal court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative interpretation\u201d \nof federal constitutional law. Id. at 885 (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 808).  \nThe circuit split created by the Fifth Circuit is not confined to DNA cases, and \nwill undoubtedly grow if not addressed by this Court. Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly had to correct the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standing decisions in recent years. See \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659 (2021); FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. 367 (2024); Murthy, --- S.Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801. In this case, the Fifth \nCircuit has failed in its obligation to \u201calways hear the case of a litigant who asserts \nthe violation of a legal right.\u201d A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, 885 (1983). This Court \nshould grant certiorari and restore declaratory judgment standing to its \nstraightforward pre-Gutierrez status. \nII. \nTHE COURT SHOULD STAY GUTIERREZ\u2019S EXECUTION.  \nGutierrez satisfies all the requirements for a stay: he has shown likely success \non the merits, he did not bring his claim for purposes of delay, and he will suffer \nirreparable injury absent a stay. \n \n\n8 \n \nA. \nGutierrez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \nGutierrez is likely to prevail on the merits. This Court\u2019s decision in Reed, its \nother standing jurisprudence, and the weight of authority from the United States \nCourts of Appeals establish that Gutierrez\u2014just like other state prisoners \nchallenging the constitutionality of post-conviction relief statutes\u2014has standing to \nallege that Chapter 64 violates due process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling stands \nalone by adding a new barrier to federal standing, one that, perversely, invites state \nofficial defendants to preclude Article III standing merely by disclaiming \nredressability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel test is likely to be overturned on review.  \nMoreover, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 64 \nhas merit. The substantive rights respectively created by Article 11.071 and Chapter \n64 are protected by procedural due process. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third \nJudicial District v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 68 (2009) (holding that a criminal defendant \nhas a \u201cliberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state \nlaw\u201d). But, as the district court in this case observed, these two statutory provisions \nare irreconcilable: A person sentenced to death in Texas cannot meet the threshold \nshowing required to file a habeas petition under Article 11.071\u2014that is, he cannot \nshow he is ineligible for the death penalty\u2014because that person cannot obtain DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 to establish that he is ineligible for the death penalty. \nAlthough there is no freestanding substantive \u201cright to collateral proceedings \nat all,\u201d BIO 37, a state\u2019s DNA procedures nevertheless must comply with baseline \nconstitutional protections, Osborne, 557 U.S. at 52. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that Article 11.071 does not codify the Sawyer doctrine on \u201cactual \n\n9 \n \ninnocence\u201d of the death penalty, BIO 37, is erroneous. The CCA has stated explicitly \nthat \u201cSection 5(a)(3) of Article 11.071 represents the Legislature\u2019s attempt to codify \nsomething very much like this federal doctrine of \u2018actual innocence of the death \npenalty\u2019 for purposes of subsequent state writs.\u201d Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \nRespondents\u2019 argument about \u201cineligibility\u201d versus \u201cunsuitability\u201d for the \ndeath penalty is confusing at best and does not cast doubt on the merit of Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim. BIO 38. Gutierrez does not dispute that evidence demonstrating ineligibility \nfor the death penalty is different from additional mitigation evidence that might \nimpact a jury\u2019s discretion to impose death. This case involves the former type of \nevidence. Gutierrez seeks to obtain DNA evidence that would show he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty because he does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of \nArticle 37.071, which requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe \ndefendant actually caused the death of the decedent or did not actually cause the \ndeath of the deceased but intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human \nlife would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2); see \u00a7 37.071(c) (\u201cThe \nstate must prove each issue submitted under Subsection (b) of this article beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on each \nissue submitted under Subsection (b) of this Article.\u201d). DNA evidence that identifies \nperpetrators but excludes Gutierrez would establish that Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not participate in the murder. \nThis evidence thus would show that Gutierrez had not \u201cactually caused the death of \n\n10 \n \nthe decedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2). \nB. \nGutierrez Has Not Delayed in Bringing His Claim.  \nAs Respondents acknowledge, this Court held in Reed that the two-year statute \nof limitations on Reed\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim began to run \u201cwhen the state litigation ended \nand deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at \n236. Specifically, \u201cthe state litigation ended . . . when the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals denied Reed\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d Id. Here, Gutierrez\u2019s state litigation \nended when the CCA affirmed the denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing on \nFebruary 26, 2020. A62. Gutierrez timely filed his \u00a7 1983 claim in the district court \nwell before that date, on September 26, 2019. \nRespondents argue that the state litigation ended not in 2020, but instead in \n2011 when the CCA affirmed the denial of an earlier request for DNA testing. BIO \n35. That prior request, however, is not the operative request. The operative request \nis Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request for DNA testing because it was based on new legal and \nfactual grounds arising after Gutierrez\u2019s prior request was denied.  \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was based on an amended version of Chapter 64; \nunlike his earlier request, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request came after Chapter 64 was \namended to eliminate the \u201cat fault\u201d provision of the prior statute. That provision, \nwhich required a defendant to show that the absence of DNA testing at the time of \ntrial was \u201cthrough no fault of the convicted person,\u201d formed part of the basis for the \ntrial court\u2019s previous denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing. See A48, A53. The \n\u201cat fault\u201d provision was removed when the statute was amended, thereby removing \n\n11 \n \nthat rationale for denying Gutierrez\u2019s request. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. \n64.01(b)(1)(B) (West 2017). \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on new facts and evidence. Prior to \n2019, Respondents denied having custody of the hair found in the decedent\u2019s hand. \nAfter undersigned counsel\u2019s repeated requests to examine physical evidence in the \nState\u2019s possession, the State made the evidence available for review on May 21, 2019. \nUpon review of the evidence, counsel discovered that the hair was in fact preserved \nin a sealed envelope in the district attorney\u2019s files. Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion thus \nrequested testing of the newly discovered hair\u2014a critical piece of evidence in light of \nthe evidence at trial suggesting that the decedent had struggled with her assailant(s).  \nFurther, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on recent advances in DNA \ntesting that have increased the likelihood of obtaining DNA evidence from the items \nin question. These advances allow for obtaining DNA samples even from small, \ndamaged, or degraded samples. For instance, under earlier testing methods, the hair \nfound in the decedent\u2019s hand would need to contain a root in order to yield a DNA \nprofile, whereas a genetic profile can now be obtained using mitochondrial DNA \ntesting even without a root. New developments in DNA technology also make it \nreasonably likely that testing could yield touch DNA left on the decedent\u2019s nightgown \nby her assailant(s). Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion requested testing based on these recent \nadvances in DNA science.  \n \nBecause the 2019 request was based on both new legal and new factual \ndevelopments, it presented a separate and distinct request for testing. The CCA \n\n12 \n \nevidently viewed it that way, as it addressed and ruled on the merits of the new issues \nraised in the 2019 motion.1 See A70\u2013A80. The denial of the 2019 request thus \ninitiated a new accrual period. Gutierrez timely brought his claim within that new \naccrual period and has not delayed pursuit of this claim. This case comes before the \nCourt under the time constraints of an impending execution not because of any action \nby Gutierrez, but because the State sought an execution date while this matter was \nstill in active litigation. \nC. \nGutierrez Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay. \nThroughout his trial and in the proceedings since, Gutierrez has maintained \nthat he did not kill Escolastica Harrison, and that he had no knowledge that others \nwere going to assault or kill her. None of the items collected during the investigation \nof this case has ever been subjected to DNA testing. Absent a stay and grant of \ncertiorari, Gutierrez faces not only the denial of process that he has repeatedly and \nconsistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution. \n \n \n \n \n1 The trial court initially granted the 2019 request. One week later, however, the \ntrial court filed two orders: one order withdrawing the order granting DNA testing, \nand another order denying the 2019 request. A59\u2013A61. \n\n13 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should issue a writ of certiorari and \nstay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court",

Goertz, 598 U.S. 230 (2023). BIO 12, \n13, 14, 22, 23. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s own opinion belies this assertion. The majority \nopinion acknowledged that by premising Article III standing on the state court record, \nit went well beyond the analysis this Court established in Reed: \u201cIt gives us some \npause that the Supreme Court in Reed did not mention examining the state court\u2019s \ndecision for whether it might affect the prosecutor\u2019s likely actions . . . .\u201d A13 n.3.  \nAs the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, it grafted onto Reed an additional \nrequirement to parse the state court record to predict whether state defendants will \nin fact comply with a declaratory judgment. The ruling below is not a straightforward \napplication of Reed, and it is not the standing analysis performed by the Eighth or \nthe Ninth Circuits. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. \nGuerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nB. \nReed Does Not Require Federal Courts to Scour the State Court \nRecord to Predict Whether State Actors Will Comply with Fed-\neral Declaratory Judgments. \nPicking apart Gutierrez\u2019s state court record with an even finer-toothed comb \nthan the Fifth Circuit, Respondents argue that standing analyses are individualized, \nthat \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross,\u201d and that \u201cstanding must be maintained as \nto each claim.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.  \n\n2 \n \nGutierrez does not dispute that standing depends on the individual plaintiff \nand each of his claims. But the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis goes far beyond that inquiry \nby resting the redressability determination on the idiosyncratic inclinations of an \nindividual defendant state actor to assess whether that actor will comply with a \nfederal court\u2019s declaratory judgment. If that were the proper analysis, identically \nsituated plaintiffs would have different standing outcomes depending on the \nidentities, personalities, and politics of Texas officials named as defendants. This \nCourt has never suggested such an inquiry is appropriate. Indeed, just the opposite. \nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992) (\u201c[W]e may assume it is \nsubstantially likely\u201d that executive officials \u201cwould abide by an authoritative \ninterpretation\u201d of federal law) (emphasis added). \nIt does not help Respondents to cite TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413 \n(2021), and Murthy v. Missouri, --- S. Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801 (June 26, 2024), for \nthe proposition that \u201cstanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d BIO 20, 24, 30. TransUnion \ninvolved a class of 8,185 plaintiffs; the Court held that only the 1,853 class members \nwho had suffered a concrete harm could establish standing, while the other 6,332 \ncould not obtain standing \u201cin gross.\u201d 594 U.S. at 417. Similarly, Murthy involved a \ngroup of plaintiffs\u2014two states and five individuals\u2014who sued \u201cdozens of Executive \nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 2024 WL 3165801, at *4. The Court held that in this \n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d the Fifth Circuit \u201cerred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and \nplatforms each as a unified whole,\u201d id. at *9, and ultimately concluded that plaintiffs \n\n3 \n \nhad not established redressability where the harm was not traceable to defendants \nin the first place, id. at *10\u201316.  \nAgain, Gutierrez does not contest that the standing inquiry must be \nindividually conducted as to him and his claims. But because this Court has already \nheld that an identically situated plaintiff has standing, so too does Gutierrez\u2014just \nlike the 1,853 similarly situated class members in TransUnion. In both Reed and \nGutierrez, the Texas courts denied the prisoner access to physical evidence for DNA \ntesting. In both cases, the physical evidence was retained by state officials who \nrefused to release it for testing. In both cases, the plaintiff sought a federal \ndeclaratory judgment that the Texas framework under which he had been denied \naccess to evidence violates due process. And in both cases the plaintiff has standing \nbecause it is reasonably likely that state officials will comply with a federal judgment \ninstead of violating it. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 513 (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Supreme Court did not say much [in Reed], what it did tell us resolves everything \nwe have to decide here.\u201d). \nC. \nEven under Respondents\u2019 Misguided Record-Scouring Ap-\nproach, the Present Case Is Not Distinguishable from This \nCourt\u2019s Opinion in Reed, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in John-\nson, or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Opinion in Redd. \nRespondents attempt to distinguish Reed by citing a footnote from the district \ncourt opinion to argue that, unlike Gutierrez, if Reed were to win a declaratory \njudgment, it would \u201celiminate Respondents\u2019 justification for refusing access to the \nevidence.\u201d BIO 28\u201329. But Respondents\u2019 argument fails even under the exacting \nreview that its approach requires.  \n\n4 \n \nThe state court in Reed specifically held that unreasonable delay precluded \nReed\u2019s statutory claim for DNA testing\u2014an infirmity independent of his claimed due \nprocess violation concerning the chain of custody requirement. Cert Pet. 18\u201319. \nRespondents now argue that, because Reed also challenged the state court\u2019s delay \nfinding in federal court, a declaratory judgment in his favor would eliminate all the \ndistrict attorney\u2019s justifications for denying access to the evidence: \u201cIf Reed succeeds \non an appeal in showing both the chain-of-custody requirements and the \nunreasonable delay provisions are unconstitutional, the defendant [in Reed] would \nhave nothing to fall back on . . . .\u201d BIO 28. This does not distinguish Reed from \nGutierrez at all.  \nRespondents\u2019 own argument to the Fifth Circuit in Reed characterized his \nunreasonable delay challenge just as they now characterize Gutierrez\u2019s innocence-of-\nthe-death-penalty challenge:  \nThe CCA applied a case-specific review to determine whether Reed\u2019s \nChapter 64 motion was timely. The court specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014Reed\u2019s assertion that he could not have sought touch DNA \ntesting earlier than he did. Reed\u2019s disagreement with the CCA\u2019s \nconclusions belies any assertions that he is making a broad attack on \nthe constitutionality of Chapter 64\u2019s procedures. Instead, he merely \ndisagreed with the CCA\u2019s fact findings and conclusions founded upon \nthose facts.  \n \nAppellee\u2019s Br., Reed v. Goertz, No. 19-70022 (5th Cir.), Doc. 38-1 at 31 (Feb. 24, 2020) \n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted). This is the same argument that \nRespondents make here: \u201cthat because the state court has already spoken on the very \ndefect purportedly redressed by the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, Gutierrez \nlacked standing to seek the declaratory judgment.\u201d BIO 12. In effect, Respondents \n\n5 \n \nargue that states can preclude redressability, and thereby defeat federal standing, by \ndenying relief under a statute alleged to be unconstitutional. Letting states \npredetermine such a purely federal question would turn Article III standing on its \nhead.     \n \nEqually unavailing is Respondents\u2019 attempt to distinguish the Eighth Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Johnson. Respondents argue that in Johnson, \u201c[t]he plaintiff alleged in \nfederal court that Arkansas\u2019s postconviction DNA testing statute, as authoritatively \nconstrued, violated his constitutional rights because it imposed too high a materiality \nstandard.\u201d BIO 31. They go on to argue that \u201ca favorable judgment in federal court \nwould have, in fact, eliminated the justification for refusing access to evidence for \ntesting based on the challenged provision of state law.\u201d Id. This analysis misstates \nthe circumstances of Johnson.  \nJohnson\u2019s claim was that the Arkansas statute violated due process by \nrequiring him to prove his innocence in order to obtain the very DNA evidence that \nwould prove his innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 510 (explaining that Johnson \n\u201calleges that Arkansas courts have arbitrarily denied him the very right to DNA \ntesting that [the statute] purports to create\u201d) (quotation omitted). The Arkansas \nSupreme Court in Johnson thus did virtually the same thing the CCA did in \nGutierrez\u2019s case. See Johnson v. State, 591 S.W.3d 265, 271\u201372 (Ark. 2019). The court \nconcluded: \u201c[N]one of the evidence that might result from the proposed testing could \nadvance Johnson\u2019s claim of actual innocence or raise a reasonable probability that he \ndid not murder Carol Heath.\u201d Id. In other words, even if the constitutional infirmity \n\n6 \n \nthat Johnson alleged were cured, and he got the testing he wanted, the Arkansas \ncourt said his request for relief would still fail because the results would not establish \na reasonable probability that he did not commit the murder. And the court said so \nwith considerably more reasoning than the conclusory opinion by the CCA here. See \nA79\u2013A80. \nNone of this was lost on the Eighth Circuit, which recited the Arkansas \nSupreme Court\u2019s holding that the evidence sought by Johnson would not tend to show \nhis innocence. See Johnson, 69 F.4th at 509. The Eighth Circuit nevertheless applied \nReed to hold that Johnson had standing because a declaratory judgment would \n\u201csignificantly increase\u201d the likelihood that state officials would relinquish the \nevidence. Id. at 511\u201312. There is simply no way to reconcile the standing analysis in \nReed and Johnson with the analysis undertaken below. \nRespondents also fail in their attempt to distinguish the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Redd, urging that the case did not involve a challenge to a state\u2019s post-conviction \nDNA statute. BIO 13 n.7, 32. This difference is irrelevant. Nothing in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standing test would limit it to DNA challenges. Private parties \nfrequently seek declaratory judgments against state-affiliated defendants who are \nnot directly obligated to comply with their terms. Redd specifically referred to this \nCourt\u2019s standing analysis in Reed to determine that Redd had standing. See 84 F.4th \nat 884. The Ninth Circuit did not parse the record of state court proceedings to \nforecast how the specific defendants would respond to a declaratory judgment. The \ncourt instead recognized that Redd had standing because he was similarly situated \n\n7 \n \nto Reed. Id. A declaratory judgment would change the legal relationship between the \nparties, with the \u201cpractical consequence\u201d of a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d \nthat the defendants would afford plaintiff the relief he sought. Id. (quoting Reed, 598 \nU.S. at 238). Far from parsing every jot and tittle of the parties\u2019 legal history, the \nNinth Circuit followed this Court\u2019s guidance and \u201cassumed it is substantially likely\u201d \nthat state officials would comply with a federal court\u2019s \u201cauthoritative interpretation\u201d \nof federal constitutional law. Id. at 885 (quoting Franklin, 505 U.S. at 808).  \nThe circuit split created by the Fifth Circuit is not confined to DNA cases, and \nwill undoubtedly grow if not addressed by this Court. Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly had to correct the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standing decisions in recent years. See \nCalifornia v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659 (2021); FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. 367 (2024); Murthy, --- S.Ct. ---, 2024 WL 3165801. In this case, the Fifth \nCircuit has failed in its obligation to \u201calways hear the case of a litigant who asserts \nthe violation of a legal right.\u201d A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, 885 (1983). This Court \nshould grant certiorari and restore declaratory judgment standing to its \nstraightforward pre-Gutierrez status. \nII. \nTHE COURT SHOULD STAY GUTIERREZ\u2019S EXECUTION.  \nGutierrez satisfies all the requirements for a stay: he has shown likely success \non the merits, he did not bring his claim for purposes of delay, and he will suffer \nirreparable injury absent a stay. \n \n\n8 \n \nA. \nGutierrez Is Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \nGutierrez is likely to prevail on the merits. This Court\u2019s decision in Reed, its \nother standing jurisprudence, and the weight of authority from the United States \nCourts of Appeals establish that Gutierrez\u2014just like other state prisoners \nchallenging the constitutionality of post-conviction relief statutes\u2014has standing to \nallege that Chapter 64 violates due process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling stands \nalone by adding a new barrier to federal standing, one that, perversely, invites state \nofficial defendants to preclude Article III standing merely by disclaiming \nredressability. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel test is likely to be overturned on review.  \nMoreover, Gutierrez\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 64 \nhas merit. The substantive rights respectively created by Article 11.071 and Chapter \n64 are protected by procedural due process. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for the Third \nJudicial District v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 68 (2009) (holding that a criminal defendant \nhas a \u201cliberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state \nlaw\u201d). But, as the district court in this case observed, these two statutory provisions \nare irreconcilable: A person sentenced to death in Texas cannot meet the threshold \nshowing required to file a habeas petition under Article 11.071\u2014that is, he cannot \nshow he is ineligible for the death penalty\u2014because that person cannot obtain DNA \ntesting under Chapter 64 to establish that he is ineligible for the death penalty. \nAlthough there is no freestanding substantive \u201cright to collateral proceedings \nat all,\u201d BIO 37, a state\u2019s DNA procedures nevertheless must comply with baseline \nconstitutional protections, Osborne, 557 U.S. at 52. Furthermore, Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that Article 11.071 does not codify the Sawyer doctrine on \u201cactual \n\n9 \n \ninnocence\u201d of the death penalty, BIO 37, is erroneous. The CCA has stated explicitly \nthat \u201cSection 5(a)(3) of Article 11.071 represents the Legislature\u2019s attempt to codify \nsomething very much like this federal doctrine of \u2018actual innocence of the death \npenalty\u2019 for purposes of subsequent state writs.\u201d Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 160 \n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \nRespondents\u2019 argument about \u201cineligibility\u201d versus \u201cunsuitability\u201d for the \ndeath penalty is confusing at best and does not cast doubt on the merit of Gutierrez\u2019s \nclaim. BIO 38. Gutierrez does not dispute that evidence demonstrating ineligibility \nfor the death penalty is different from additional mitigation evidence that might \nimpact a jury\u2019s discretion to impose death. This case involves the former type of \nevidence. Gutierrez seeks to obtain DNA evidence that would show he is ineligible for \nthe death penalty because he does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of \nArticle 37.071, which requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe \ndefendant actually caused the death of the decedent or did not actually cause the \ndeath of the deceased but intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human \nlife would be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2); see \u00a7 37.071(c) (\u201cThe \nstate must prove each issue submitted under Subsection (b) of this article beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and the jury shall return a special verdict of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on each \nissue submitted under Subsection (b) of this Article.\u201d). DNA evidence that identifies \nperpetrators but excludes Gutierrez would establish that Gutierrez was not present \ninside the trailer where the murder took place and did not participate in the murder. \nThis evidence thus would show that Gutierrez had not \u201cactually caused the death of \n\n10 \n \nthe decedent or . . . intended to kill the deceased or anticipated that a human life \nwould be taken.\u201d Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2). \nB. \nGutierrez Has Not Delayed in Bringing His Claim.  \nAs Respondents acknowledge, this Court held in Reed that the two-year statute \nof limitations on Reed\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim began to run \u201cwhen the state litigation ended \nand deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing.\u201d Reed, 598 U.S. at \n236. Specifically, \u201cthe state litigation ended . . . when the Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals denied Reed\u2019s motion for rehearing.\u201d Id. Here, Gutierrez\u2019s state litigation \nended when the CCA affirmed the denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing on \nFebruary 26, 2020. A62. Gutierrez timely filed his \u00a7 1983 claim in the district court \nwell before that date, on September 26, 2019. \nRespondents argue that the state litigation ended not in 2020, but instead in \n2011 when the CCA affirmed the denial of an earlier request for DNA testing. BIO \n35. That prior request, however, is not the operative request. The operative request \nis Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request for DNA testing because it was based on new legal and \nfactual grounds arising after Gutierrez\u2019s prior request was denied.  \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was based on an amended version of Chapter 64; \nunlike his earlier request, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request came after Chapter 64 was \namended to eliminate the \u201cat fault\u201d provision of the prior statute. That provision, \nwhich required a defendant to show that the absence of DNA testing at the time of \ntrial was \u201cthrough no fault of the convicted person,\u201d formed part of the basis for the \ntrial court\u2019s previous denial of Gutierrez\u2019s request for DNA testing. See A48, A53. The \n\u201cat fault\u201d provision was removed when the statute was amended, thereby removing \n\n11 \n \nthat rationale for denying Gutierrez\u2019s request. See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. \n64.01(b)(1)(B) (West 2017). \nGutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on new facts and evidence. Prior to \n2019, Respondents denied having custody of the hair found in the decedent\u2019s hand. \nAfter undersigned counsel\u2019s repeated requests to examine physical evidence in the \nState\u2019s possession, the State made the evidence available for review on May 21, 2019. \nUpon review of the evidence, counsel discovered that the hair was in fact preserved \nin a sealed envelope in the district attorney\u2019s files. Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion thus \nrequested testing of the newly discovered hair\u2014a critical piece of evidence in light of \nthe evidence at trial suggesting that the decedent had struggled with her assailant(s).  \nFurther, Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 request was also based on recent advances in DNA \ntesting that have increased the likelihood of obtaining DNA evidence from the items \nin question. These advances allow for obtaining DNA samples even from small, \ndamaged, or degraded samples. For instance, under earlier testing methods, the hair \nfound in the decedent\u2019s hand would need to contain a root in order to yield a DNA \nprofile, whereas a genetic profile can now be obtained using mitochondrial DNA \ntesting even without a root. New developments in DNA technology also make it \nreasonably likely that testing could yield touch DNA left on the decedent\u2019s nightgown \nby her assailant(s). Gutierrez\u2019s 2019 motion requested testing based on these recent \nadvances in DNA science.  \n \nBecause the 2019 request was based on both new legal and new factual \ndevelopments, it presented a separate and distinct request for testing. The CCA \n\n12 \n \nevidently viewed it that way, as it addressed and ruled on the merits of the new issues \nraised in the 2019 motion.1 See A70\u2013A80. The denial of the 2019 request thus \ninitiated a new accrual period. Gutierrez timely brought his claim within that new \naccrual period and has not delayed pursuit of this claim. This case comes before the \nCourt under the time constraints of an impending execution not because of any action \nby Gutierrez, but because the State sought an execution date while this matter was \nstill in active litigation. \nC. \nGutierrez Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay. \nThroughout his trial and in the proceedings since, Gutierrez has maintained \nthat he did not kill Escolastica Harrison, and that he had no knowledge that others \nwere going to assault or kill her. None of the items collected during the investigation \nof this case has ever been subjected to DNA testing. Absent a stay and grant of \ncertiorari, Gutierrez faces not only the denial of process that he has repeatedly and \nconsistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not \ncommit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution. \n \n \n \n \n1 The trial court initially granted the 2019 request. One week later, however, the \ntrial court filed two orders: one order withdrawing the order granting DNA testing, \nand another order denying the 2019 request. A59\u2013A61. \n\n13 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should issue a writ of certiorari and \nstay Gutierrez\u2019s execution, which was not scheduled when the Fifth Circuit \nproceedings began. It should then either set the case for full briefing, or summarily \nvacate the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Shawn Nolan \n \n \n \n \nShawn Nolan* \n \n \n \n \nAnne Fisher  \n \n \n \n \nAssistant Federal Defenders \n \n  \nFederal Community Defender Office \n \n  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n \n601 Walnut Street, Suite 545 West \n \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 \n \n \n \n(215) 928-0520 \nShawn_Nolan@fd.org \nAnnie_Fisher@fd.org \n \n*Counsel of record for Petitioner \nMember of the Bar of the Supreme Court",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been further refined, not by new external evidence, but by an internal reasoning step that confirms my analytical framework. This observation solidifies my belief about the central pivot point of the case at this certiorari stage. My beliefs are therefore more focused, but the core substance remains stable from the previous update.\n\n1.  **Stable Core Issue Confirmed**: My prior belief that the case is a direct confrontation over the meaning and application of *Reed v. Goertz* is confirmed. The internal reasoning step solidifies that the entire dispute boils down to whether the Fifth Circuit's \"futility\" analysis is a permissible application of standing principles or an impermissible contradiction of *Reed*.\n\n2.  **Centrality of the June 2024 TCCA Ruling Reaffirmed**: The observation confirms that the most critical piece of evidence introduced so far is the Respondents' claim about the June 27, 2024, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) ruling. My belief that this ruling is the linchpin of the Respondents' entire opposition strategy is now firmly established. It is the factual predicate for their legal argument that a federal court order would be non-redressable.\n\n3.  **Analytical Focus Sharpened**: While my previous beliefs identified the key arguments, this observation sharpens my focus onto the single most important question for predicting the Court's next action (granting or denying certiorari): **How does the petitioner rebut the argument that the June 2024 TCCA ruling makes his injury un-redressable?** My predictive model is now explicitly waiting for this specific input. The case's trajectory hinges on whether the petitioner can convincingly argue that:\n    *   The Respondents have mischaracterized the TCCA ruling; OR\n    *   The TCCA ruling is legally irrelevant to the Article III standing analysis under *Reed*, which focuses only on the immediate procedural injury and the ability of the federal court to remedy *that specific injury* (i.e., ordering the DA to allow testing), regardless of downstream consequences in state court.\n\n4.  **No Change to Substantive Beliefs**: Because the observation was an internal thought process and not new evidence, my substantive beliefs about the arguments themselves remain unchanged from the previous update. The Respondents' strategy is still to distinguish *Reed* by citing a supervening state court action and aligning with the Supreme Court's recent restrictive standing jurisprudence (*TransUnion*, *AHM*, *Murthy*). The Petitioner's core argument remains that the injury is the denial of a procedural right by the DA, which is directly redressable by an order against that same DA.\n\nIn summary, this observation acts as a checkpoint, confirming that my analysis of the Respondents' brief was correct in identifying the dispositive issue at this stage. My belief state is stable, but my analytical path forward is now crystal clear. The next piece of evidence\u2014the Petitioner's Reply Brief\u2014is not just helpful; it is essential. My ability to predict the outcome of the certiorari petition is now almost entirely dependent on the contents of that forthcoming document and how it addresses the \"futility\" argument anchored by the recent TCCA decision.",

          "task_beliefs": "The Petitioner's Reply Brief has provided the critical missing piece of information I was waiting for, directly answering the central question posed by the Respondents' opposition. This observation significantly updates my beliefs, moving from identifying the dispositive issue to analyzing a compelling rebuttal, thereby increasing my confidence in a likely outcome.\n\n1.  **Stable Core Issue Confirmed**: My belief that this case is a direct confrontation over the meaning of *Reed v. Goertz* is fully confirmed. The Petitioner's Reply Brief is structured entirely around the argument that the Fifth Circuit \"rewrites\" *Reed* rather than applying it.\n\n2.  **Respondents' Key Argument Directly Rebutted**: My previous belief focused on the critical need to see how the petitioner would rebut the \"futility\" argument, which was anchored by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) ruling. The Reply Brief provides a multi-layered rebuttal that fundamentally alters the calculus:\n    *   **Rebuttal by Principle**: The petitioner argues that the *Reed* standing analysis should not involve \"scour[ing] the state court record to predict whether state actors will comply.\" Instead, it posits that federal courts should rely on the principle from *Franklin v. Massachusetts* and \"assume it is substantially likely\" that state officials will abide by a federal court's judgment. This shifts the debate from a case-specific factual inquiry (what the TCCA said) to a foundational principle of federal court power and comity.\n    *   **Rebuttal by Precedent (The \"Recycled Argument\" Signal)**: The brief reveals a crucial new fact: the Respondents are making the *same type of argument* in this case that they made and lost in *Reed*. The petitioner shows that in *Reed*, the state argued that a separate state court finding (on \"unreasonable delay\") would make a federal order futile, yet the Supreme Court still found standing. This powerfully suggests the Respondents' current argument is a recycled one that the Court has already implicitly rejected.\n    *   **Rebuttal by Analogy (*Johnson* v. *Griffin*)**: The petitioner effectively dismantles the Respondents' attempt to distinguish this case from the Eighth Circuit's decision in *Johnson*. The brief clarifies that the Arkansas state court in *Johnson* had *also* pre-judged the utility of DNA testing, concluding it could not advance the claim of innocence. Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit, following *Reed*, found standing. This establishes that the Fifth Circuit's logic in *Gutierrez* is in direct conflict with how the Eighth Circuit applied *Reed* to nearly identical facts, solidifying the existence of a circuit split.\n\n3.  **The TCCA Ruling's Relevance Diminished**: My prior belief in the \"centrality\" of the June 2024 TCCA ruling is now significantly revised. While it remains the linchpin of the *Respondents'* argument, the Petitioner's Reply has framed it as legally *irrelevant* to the federal Article III standing question. The core argument is that state courts cannot be allowed to defeat federal jurisdiction over a constitutional claim simply by issuing a ruling that pre-judges the outcome of the federal remedy. This strategic framing elevates the dispute from the facts of the TCCA ruling to a major question of federalism.\n\n4.  **Increased Confidence in Certiorari Grant and Stay**: The Reply Brief provides strong signals that favor a grant of certiorari and a stay of execution. My confidence has increased due to the petitioner's clear articulation of:\n    *   A direct conflict with a recent, controlling Supreme Court precedent (*Reed*).\n    *   A deepening circuit split, with the Fifth Circuit on one side and the Eighth (*Johnson*) and Ninth (*Redd*) on the other.\n    *   A compelling narrative that the Fifth Circuit is a repeat outlier on standing doctrine, citing the Court's recent reversals in *California v. Texas*, *FDA v. AHM*, and *Murthy v. Missouri*.\n\n5.  **Sharpened Understanding of Merits and Procedural History**: The brief adds important details that strengthen the petitioner's overall case. I now understand that Gutierrez's 2019 DNA testing request was not a simple repeat of his 2011 request. It was based on new legal grounds (an amendment to Texas's Chapter 64 statute) and new factual grounds (the discovery of previously unknown evidence and advances in DNA technology). This directly counters the state's claims of delay and reinforces the timeliness of the federal lawsuit under the *Reed* accrual standard. Furthermore, the brief clarifies that the DNA evidence is sought to prove \"ineligibility\" for the death penalty under a specific Texas statute (Art. 37.071(b)(2)), not just for general mitigation, making the underlying constitutional claim more concrete.",
