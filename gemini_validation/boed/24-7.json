    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2012, California applied for a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement its Advanced Clean Car Program, which included two key components: a Low Emission Vehicle Program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 34% for new cars in Model Years 2017-2025, and a Zero Emission Vehicle Program requiring about 15% of manufacturers\u2019 fleets to be electric cars by 2025. The EPA granted this waiver in 2013, and automobile manufacturers began investing to meet these requirements.\n\nHowever, in 2019, under a different administration, the EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, arguing that state greenhouse gas regulations were preempted by federal fuel economy standards, that California\u2019s standards weren\u2019t necessary to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d and that California could not show a direct connection between greenhouse gas emissions and its air pollution problems. After this withdrawal, several automakers like Honda, Ford, and BMW voluntarily agreed to continue meeting California\u2019s standards due to their existing investments and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. In 2022, under yet another administration, the EPA reversed course again and reinstated the 2013 waiver, prompting challenges from various states and fuel industry groups who argued that California should not receive special treatment and that climate change is not a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condition\u201d justifying state-specific standards. California, environmental organizations, and automobile manufacturers intervened to defend the EPA\u2019s decision.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit dismissed most of the claims for lack of standing, finding that challengers had not shown that their injuries were redressable by a favorable decision.",

      "eig_reasoning": "This THINK action represents a crucial step in structuring the problem. While it doesn't introduce new external facts, it synthesizes the initial information to create a highly effective plan. \n\nTask EIG is high (0.7) because the thought process correctly identifies the central legal issue (Article III standing, specifically redressability) and formulates a precise, efficient plan to acquire the most critical information: the petitioners' specific arguments against the D.C. Circuit's finding. This moves the agent from a state of 'knowing nothing' to 'knowing exactly what to look for and where,' which is a massive gain in understanding how to approach this specific prediction task.\n\nDesign EIG is even higher (0.8) because the strategy employed is a textbook example of effective legal analysis that is generalizable to almost any SCOTUS case. The pattern of: 1) Identify the lower court's core holding, 2) Pinpoint the specific legal question on appeal, and 3) Target the petitioner's primary brief (the cert petition) to understand their main arguments, is a foundational and highly effective design pattern for this domain. Validating this approach provides significant information about general prediction strategies.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this action provides a clear roadmap for the current task while simultaneously reinforcing a powerful, reusable strategic template.",

This information will directly inform my analysis of how different justices might view the 'substantial likelihood' standard for redressability in the face of complex market forces. The Task EIG is therefore very high. For Design EIG, this action reinforces a core strategy: always analyze the cert petition to understand how a case is framed, particularly how procedural hurdles like standing are argued. Learning how litigants attempt to overcome a 'no redressability' finding is a valuable, generalizable pattern for future regulatory cases, making the design gain moderately high.",

ARFFA \nSULLIVAN & CROMWELL LLP \n125 Broad Street  \nNew York, NY 10004 \n \n \n(Additional counsel on signature page) \n\n \n(I) \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED \nSection 209(a) of the Clean Air Act generally \npreempts States from adopting emission standards for \nnew motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But under \nSection 209(b) of that Act, EPA may grant California\u2014\nand only California\u2014a waiver from federal preemption \nto set its own vehicle-emission standards.  Before \ngranting a preemption waiver, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission standards \u201cto meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn 2022, EPA granted California a waiver to set its \nown standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and to \nadopt a zero-emission-vehicle mandate, both expressly \nintended to address global climate change by reducing \nCalifornia vehicles\u2019 consumption of liquid fuel.  Fuel \nproducers challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as contrary to the \ntext of Section 209(b).  The D.C. Circuit rejected the \nchallenge without reaching the merits, concluding that \nfuel producers\u2019 injuries were not redressable because \nthey had not established that vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould have any effect on automakers.   \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether a party may establish the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing by relying on the  \ncoercive and predictable effects of regulation on third \nparties. \n2.  Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for Califor-\nnia\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-\nemission-vehicle mandate is unlawful. \n\n \n(II) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Clean \nFuels Development Coalition, Diamond Alternative \nEnergy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn \nGrowers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Kan-\nsas Corn Growers Association, Michigan Corn Growers \nAssociation, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nMissouri Corn Growers Association, National Associa-\ntion of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean As-\nsociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, \nLLC. \nRespondents are the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Michael S.

It starts off modestly enough:  because both \nmotor vehicles and air pollution often cross state bor-\nders, Section 209(a) entrusts EPA to enact nationwide \nvehicle-emission standards and preempts States from \nadopting their own.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a); see id. \u00a7 7410.  \nBut then Section 209(b) does something unusual:  it  \nallows EPA to grant a waiver from preemption to a  \nsingle State\u2014California\u2014to enforce its own vehicle- \nemission standards.  To escape preemption, California \nmust demonstrate to EPA that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own \nemission standards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  Other States \n\n2 \n \n \nmay not establish their own standards, but they may \nelect to follow EPA\u2019s or California\u2019s. \nAs a concurrent challenge of 17 States explains, \nthere are serious constitutional concerns with a statute \nthat allows only California to act as a junior-varsity \nEPA.  Still, for its first several decades, Section 209 \nworked more or less as intended.  EPA granted \npreemption waivers for California to tackle local prob-\nlems like smog in the Los Angeles basin, where the pol-\nlution was both generated by and felt by Californians.  \nBut all sensibility stopped in 2009, when California be-\ngan claiming that Section 209 authorized it to set stand-\nards to curb greenhouse gases in an effort to tackle \nglobal climate change.  For the next decade, EPA flip-\nflopped under each new Presidential Administration \nabout whether it could grant California such a waiver.  \nIn this latest order, EPA has again taken the position \nthat Section 209 permits California to operate as a \nquasi-federal regulator on global climate change.   \nThat vaunted role cannot be squared with the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Section 209.  First, climate \nchange is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d condition within Cal-\nifornia, and thus within the meaning of Section \n209(b)(1)(B), because it is a global issue that is not lo-\ncalized to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its own emission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d global  \nclimate-change conditions, as its standards would have \nno discernable effect on climate-change-related condi-\ntions in the State (or anywhere else).  Global climate \nchange is, in short, not the kind of California-specific \ncondition that Section 209(b) carves out from preemp-\ntion. \nThe question whether California may set green-\nhouse-gas emission standards for itself and other \n\n3 \n \n \nStates is undeniably major.  California has mandated \n100% electric vehicles by 2036, and is forcing electrifi-\ncation of the country\u2019s vehicle fleet.  And the Executive \nBranch intends exactly that.  The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and EPA have set their \nown fuel-economy and emission standards that impose \nde facto electric-vehicle mandates in violation of their \ngoverning statutes.  The companion challenges to those \nrules are awaiting decision by the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTexas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (filed Feb. 28, 2022); Natu-\nral Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, No. 22-1080 (filed \nMay 11, 2022).  But by granting California the author-\nity to outstrip even those mandates, EPA has put in \nplace a backstop to the unlawful federal rules.  Simply \nput, the waiver and authority claimed here are key \nparts of a coordinated agency strategy to convert the \nNation from liquid-fuel-powered vehicles to electric ve-\nhicles.  If that strategy seems familiar, it should.  See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nDespite the issue\u2019s importance, the D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears.  It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.  \nThis time, the D.C. Circuit dodged the issue under the \nguise of redressability.  Petitioners are entities and as-\nsociations of entities that produce or sell liquid fuels \nand the raw materials used to make them.  Facing a \nregulation designed to reduce the demand for their \nproducts, petitioners\u2019 standing is self-evident.  They \nalso introduced unrebutted standing declarations \nabout how California\u2019s standards will increase the sales \nof electric vehicles and reduce the consumption of liq-\nuid fuel\u2014which, after all, is their express purpose.  See \nApp., infra, 19a-20a.  But in a per curiam opinion, the \n\n4 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit held that petitioners had not established \nredressability because they had not submitted evi-\ndence, such as affidavits from third-party automakers, \nshowing precisely how automakers would adjust their \nproduction or prices during the four years of the \nwaiver.  Id. at 30a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing decision is wrong and \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Under precedents of this \nCourt and even the D.C. Circuit, \u201cremov[ing] a regula-\ntory hurdle\u201d to the sale of a challenger\u2019s product suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Energy Future Coa-\nlition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.); see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997).  At a minimum, challengers to governmental ac-\ntion can rely on the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation \non third parties to establish causation and redressabil-\nity.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 768 (2019).  Where, as here, the entire point of the \nchallenged regulation is to reduce consumption of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 products, a decision vacating the regulation \nwould obviously provide redress.  Other courts of ap-\npeals applying these principles have thus found stand-\ning without relying on the sort of affidavits that the \ncourt below demanded.  Left uncorrected, the decision \nbelow will impose an often insurmountable barrier to \nchallenges in the court of appeals that is the primary \nhome for administrative litigation.   \nThis Court should also reach the merits of petition-\ners\u2019 challenge, and finally decide whether EPA has the \nauthority to grant California a preemption waiver to \naddress global climate change.  The challenged Califor-\nnia standards are in effect only through model year \n2025, so merely correcting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing \nmistake may mean that no court considers the merits \n\n5 \n \n \nbefore the waiver expires.  And granting review of both \nquestions presented is also the most reasonable way to \nresolve the States\u2019 concurrent challenge to the decision \nbelow.  The States challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as uncon-\nstitutional because Section 209(b) violates the principle \nof equal sovereignty, and the court below rejected that \nconstitutional argument on the merits.  App., infra, \n49a.  Granting review of the merits would allow the \nCourt to consider whether EPA\u2019s waiver is statutorily \nauthorized before needing to reach the States\u2019 consti-\ntutional questions, raised in a separate petition.  The \nCourt should grant both this petition and the States\u2019, \nand reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (App., infra, 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 286a-290a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \nTitle II of the Clean Air Act makes EPA the Na-\ntion\u2019s primary regulator of motor-vehicle emissions.  \n\n6 \n \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410.  To effectuate a (mostly) uniform fed-\neral emissions regime, Section 209(a) of the Act prohib-\nits States from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce \nany standard relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs.\u201d  Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. \n1979). \nCongress allowed only one exception to Section \n209(a)\u2019s broad preemption provision:  Section 209(b), \nwhich authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption for Cali-\nfornia, under limited circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).

But under \nSection 209(b) of that Act, EPA may grant California\u2014\nand only California\u2014a waiver from federal preemption \nto set its own vehicle-emission standards.  Before \ngranting a preemption waiver, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission standards \u201cto meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn 2022, EPA granted California a waiver to set its \nown standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and to \nadopt a zero-emission-vehicle mandate, both expressly \nintended to address global climate change by reducing \nCalifornia vehicles\u2019 consumption of liquid fuel.  Fuel \nproducers challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as contrary to the \ntext of Section 209(b).  The D.C. Circuit rejected the \nchallenge without reaching the merits, concluding that \nfuel producers\u2019 injuries were not redressable because \nthey had not established that vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould have any effect on automakers.   \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether a party may establish the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing by relying on the  \ncoercive and predictable effects of regulation on third \nparties. \n2.  Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for Califor-\nnia\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-\nemission-vehicle mandate is unlawful. \n\n \n(II) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Clean \nFuels Development Coalition, Diamond Alternative \nEnergy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn \nGrowers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Kan-\nsas Corn Growers Association, Michigan Corn Growers \nAssociation, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nMissouri Corn Growers Association, National Associa-\ntion of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean As-\nsociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, \nLLC. \nRespondents are the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Michael S.

It starts off modestly enough:  because both \nmotor vehicles and air pollution often cross state bor-\nders, Section 209(a) entrusts EPA to enact nationwide \nvehicle-emission standards and preempts States from \nadopting their own.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a); see id. \u00a7 7410.  \nBut then Section 209(b) does something unusual:  it  \nallows EPA to grant a waiver from preemption to a  \nsingle State\u2014California\u2014to enforce its own vehicle- \nemission standards.  To escape preemption, California \nmust demonstrate to EPA that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own \nemission standards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  Other States \n\n2 \n \n \nmay not establish their own standards, but they may \nelect to follow EPA\u2019s or California\u2019s. \nAs a concurrent challenge of 17 States explains, \nthere are serious constitutional concerns with a statute \nthat allows only California to act as a junior-varsity \nEPA.  Still, for its first several decades, Section 209 \nworked more or less as intended.  EPA granted \npreemption waivers for California to tackle local prob-\nlems like smog in the Los Angeles basin, where the pol-\nlution was both generated by and felt by Californians.  \nBut all sensibility stopped in 2009, when California be-\ngan claiming that Section 209 authorized it to set stand-\nards to curb greenhouse gases in an effort to tackle \nglobal climate change.  For the next decade, EPA flip-\nflopped under each new Presidential Administration \nabout whether it could grant California such a waiver.  \nIn this latest order, EPA has again taken the position \nthat Section 209 permits California to operate as a \nquasi-federal regulator on global climate change.   \nThat vaunted role cannot be squared with the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Section 209.  First, climate \nchange is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d condition within Cal-\nifornia, and thus within the meaning of Section \n209(b)(1)(B), because it is a global issue that is not lo-\ncalized to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its own emission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d global  \nclimate-change conditions, as its standards would have \nno discernable effect on climate-change-related condi-\ntions in the State (or anywhere else).  Global climate \nchange is, in short, not the kind of California-specific \ncondition that Section 209(b) carves out from preemp-\ntion. \nThe question whether California may set green-\nhouse-gas emission standards for itself and other \n\n3 \n \n \nStates is undeniably major.  California has mandated \n100% electric vehicles by 2036, and is forcing electrifi-\ncation of the country\u2019s vehicle fleet.  And the Executive \nBranch intends exactly that.  The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and EPA have set their \nown fuel-economy and emission standards that impose \nde facto electric-vehicle mandates in violation of their \ngoverning statutes.  The companion challenges to those \nrules are awaiting decision by the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTexas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (filed Feb. 28, 2022); Natu-\nral Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, No. 22-1080 (filed \nMay 11, 2022).  But by granting California the author-\nity to outstrip even those mandates, EPA has put in \nplace a backstop to the unlawful federal rules.  Simply \nput, the waiver and authority claimed here are key \nparts of a coordinated agency strategy to convert the \nNation from liquid-fuel-powered vehicles to electric ve-\nhicles.  If that strategy seems familiar, it should.  See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nDespite the issue\u2019s importance, the D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears.  It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.  \nThis time, the D.C. Circuit dodged the issue under the \nguise of redressability.  Petitioners are entities and as-\nsociations of entities that produce or sell liquid fuels \nand the raw materials used to make them.  Facing a \nregulation designed to reduce the demand for their \nproducts, petitioners\u2019 standing is self-evident.  They \nalso introduced unrebutted standing declarations \nabout how California\u2019s standards will increase the sales \nof electric vehicles and reduce the consumption of liq-\nuid fuel\u2014which, after all, is their express purpose.  See \nApp., infra, 19a-20a.  But in a per curiam opinion, the \n\n4 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit held that petitioners had not established \nredressability because they had not submitted evi-\ndence, such as affidavits from third-party automakers, \nshowing precisely how automakers would adjust their \nproduction or prices during the four years of the \nwaiver.  Id. at 30a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing decision is wrong and \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Under precedents of this \nCourt and even the D.C. Circuit, \u201cremov[ing] a regula-\ntory hurdle\u201d to the sale of a challenger\u2019s product suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Energy Future Coa-\nlition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.); see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997).  At a minimum, challengers to governmental ac-\ntion can rely on the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation \non third parties to establish causation and redressabil-\nity.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 768 (2019).  Where, as here, the entire point of the \nchallenged regulation is to reduce consumption of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 products, a decision vacating the regulation \nwould obviously provide redress.  Other courts of ap-\npeals applying these principles have thus found stand-\ning without relying on the sort of affidavits that the \ncourt below demanded.  Left uncorrected, the decision \nbelow will impose an often insurmountable barrier to \nchallenges in the court of appeals that is the primary \nhome for administrative litigation.   \nThis Court should also reach the merits of petition-\ners\u2019 challenge, and finally decide whether EPA has the \nauthority to grant California a preemption waiver to \naddress global climate change.  The challenged Califor-\nnia standards are in effect only through model year \n2025, so merely correcting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing \nmistake may mean that no court considers the merits \n\n5 \n \n \nbefore the waiver expires.  And granting review of both \nquestions presented is also the most reasonable way to \nresolve the States\u2019 concurrent challenge to the decision \nbelow.  The States challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as uncon-\nstitutional because Section 209(b) violates the principle \nof equal sovereignty, and the court below rejected that \nconstitutional argument on the merits.  App., infra, \n49a.  Granting review of the merits would allow the \nCourt to consider whether EPA\u2019s waiver is statutorily \nauthorized before needing to reach the States\u2019 consti-\ntutional questions, raised in a separate petition.  The \nCourt should grant both this petition and the States\u2019, \nand reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (App., infra, 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 286a-290a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \nTitle II of the Clean Air Act makes EPA the Na-\ntion\u2019s primary regulator of motor-vehicle emissions.  \n\n6 \n \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410.  To effectuate a (mostly) uniform fed-\neral emissions regime, Section 209(a) of the Act prohib-\nits States from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce \nany standard relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs.\u201d  Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. \n1979). \nCongress allowed only one exception to Section \n209(a)\u2019s broad preemption provision:  Section 209(b), \nwhich authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption for Cali-\nfornia, under limited circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by criteria pollu-\ntants like ozone and particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  California\u2019s atypical \u201cgeography \nand prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together with its unusu-\nally large number of vehicles, made smog a more per-\nsistent problem there than elsewhere.  49 Fed. Reg. \n18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing 113 Cong. Rec. \n30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)).   \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  California may ap-\nply for a waiver only if it \u201cdetermines that [its own] \nState standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as \nprotective of public health and welfare as applicable \nFederal standards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  EPA must \nthen evaluate the application and deny a waiver if, \namong other things, it finds that California\u2019s protec-\ntiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); or if California \u201cdoes not need such \n\n7 \n \n \nState standards to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B). \nIn 1977, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow any other State to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California \nstandards \u201cfor which a waiver has been granted,\u201d so \nlong as the State has a federally approved plan to at-\ntain the air-quality standards EPA sets for criteria pol-\nlutants.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot \nof this unusual preemption system is that EPA sets na-\ntionwide emission standards; California may in limited \ncircumstances set more stringent ones in California; \nand other States may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or \nadopt California\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, California used its waiver author-\nity as Congress intended, to set emission standards to \ncombat local air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., \n38 Fed. Reg. 10,235, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. \nReg. 48,557, 48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, \nhowever, California has sought to transform this ex-\nception for tackling localized pollution into a tool for \naddressing global climate change through forced elec-\ntrification of its vehicle fleet.   \nThat effort initially failed.  In 2008, EPA denied Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first application for a waiver allowing it to set \nemission standards to address climate change.  EPA \ndetermined that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemption waiver \npermitted California to enact standards only to ad-\ndress \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \u201ccausal \nfactors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obviously did \nnot include global climate change.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,163 (Mar. 6, 2008).  \n\n8 \n \n \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication for greenhouse-gas standards.  EPA \ngranted reconsideration, reversed itself, and issued the \nwaiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,755, 32,783 (July 8, 2009).  A \nnumber of affected parties challenged EPA\u2019s decision, \nbut the D.C. Circuit held that the case was moot be-\ncause California had \u201cdeemed\u201d compliance with federal \nstandards to satisfy the State\u2019s standards as well.  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).   \n2.  In 2012, California applied for a new waiver to \nallow it to impose even more standards aimed at curb-\ning greenhouse-gas emissions.  This case concerns that \n2012 waiver application and the \u201cAdvanced Clean Car\u201d \nstandards that it imposes.  Those standards govern all \nnew passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-\nduty vehicles sold in California for model years 2015 \nthrough 2025. \nAs relevant here, the Advanced Clean Car stand-\nards have two key features that require a preemption \nwaiver.  First, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards limit carbon-dioxide emissions and thus ef-\nfectively force manufacturers to produce and sell fewer \ncars that run on liquid fuel.  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,137 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  Second, the California standards include \na \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d mandate, which requires \neach car manufacturer to produce and deliver for sale \nan increasing percentage of electric or fuel-cell vehi-\ncles (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d instead).  Cal. \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  By model year 2025, the re-\nquired percentage of zero-emission vehicles will rise to \naround 22%.  Ibid.  California explained that the man-\ndated zero-emission vehicles \u201ccan dramatically reduce \n\n9 \n \n \npetroleum consumption . . . compared to conventional \ntechnologies.\u201d  Advanced Clean Cars Waiver Request \n7-9 (May 2012), https://www.regulations.gov/docu-\nment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0006.   \n3. In 2013, EPA granted a waiver for California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program.  EPA concluded that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s criteria\u2014\nincluding that they were \u201cneeded to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because the threat of \nglobal climate change was itself \u201ccompelling.\u201d  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2,130.  Notably, EPA credited California\u2019s find-\ning that the cost of its regulations would be \u201cmore than \noffset by consumer fuel savings over the life of the ve-\nhicles.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,138.  At the time, however, \nCalifornia had kept in place its \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d \nprovision, and so potential challengers were stuck with \nthe unfavorable D.C. Circuit standing precedent.  Cal-\nifornia maintained that provision until 2018, when EPA \nset less stringent standards during the Trump Admin-\nistration. \n4. After that change in Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209.  In a 2019 \njoint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, \nagain reasoning that climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,339 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  In addition, EPA found that Califor-\nnia did not \u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-\nchange conditions because California\u2019s standards \nwould likely result in \u201cno change in temperatures or \nphysical impacts resulting from anthropogenic climate \nchange in California.\u201d  Id. at 51,341 (emphasis added).  \n\n10 \n \n \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to consider \n\u201csuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037 \n(Jan. 25, 2021).  EPA dutifully followed the President\u2019s \nlead and reinstated California\u2019s waiver.  App., infra, \n57a.   \nIn granting the waiver, EPA flipped back to its 2013 \nunderstanding of Section 209(b).  It concluded that the \nwaiver was justified in part because California needs \nits emission program as a whole\u2014not the particular \nAdvanced Clean Cars program that was the subject of \nthe waiver\u2014to address its criteria-pollution problems.  \nId. at 158a-166a.  EPA also found that California \nneeded its emission standards and zero-emission vehi-\ncle mandate because the effects of global climate \nchange in California are \u201cextreme,\u201d and because there \nis a \u201clogical link\u201d between local air-pollution problems \nand greenhouse-gas emissions.  Id. at 207a, 215a.   \nTo date, 17 States and the District of Columbia have \nadopted California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards, its \nzero-emission-vehicle mandate, or both.  CARB, States \nthat Have Adopted California\u2019s Vehicle Regulations \n(June 2024), https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/ \nadvanced-clean-cars-program/states-have-adopted-\ncalifornias-vehicle-regulations.  Together with Califor-\nnia, those jurisdictions account for more than 40% of \nthe Nation\u2019s new vehicle market.  87 Fed. Reg. 14,332, \n14,358 (Mar. 14, 2022). \n2. Petitioners are entities that produce or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them, \nalong with associations whose members include such \nentities.  They challenged EPA\u2019s waiver reinstatement \n\n11 \n \n \nin the D.C. Circuit.  App., infra, 2a.  Petitioners filed \ndetailed standing declarations, explaining that the re-\ninstatement of California\u2019s standards would depress \ndemand for fuel, injuring them financially.  Id. at 19a-\n20a.  The State of Ohio, along with a coalition of 16 \nother States, separately challenged the reinstatement \non the ground that California\u2019s unique exemption from \nnationwide preemption violates the constitutional \nequal-sovereignty principle.   \nIn defending the waiver reinstatement, EPA did not \ncontest petitioners\u2019 Article III standing.  On the mer-\nits, it primarily relied on what it refers to as its \u201cwhole \nprogram\u201d approach.  Under this reading of the Clean \nAir Act, Section 209(b)(1)(B) is satisfied if \u201cCalifornia \nneeds its program as a whole to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, EPA argued that California \ncan tack on any emission standards it likes to its emis-\nsions \u201cprogram,\u201d \u201cso long as\u201d the State\u2019s criteria- \npollutant problems \u201cpersist.\u201d  Id. at 66.   \nUnlike EPA, California and other state and local in-\ntervenors challenged petitioners\u2019 standing.  They con-\ntended that automakers were independently increas-\ning electric-vehicle production in response to consumer \ndemand, and that petitioners had not \u201cestablished any \nprobability that manufacturers would change course if \nEPA\u2019s decision were vacated.\u201d  C.A. California \nBr. 13-15.  But their own intervention motion attached \ndeclarations asserting that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled \nvehicles would be sold during these model years\u201d if \nEPA\u2019s waiver were overturned. C.A. States\u2019 Int. Mot., \nScheehle Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.  In reply, petitioners further \nexplained that they had standing because vacating the \nwaiver would remove a \u201cdirect regulatory impediment\u201d \n\n12 \n \n \nto their products\u2019 use.  C.A. Reply 4 (citing Energy Fu-\nture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144).  They also noted that Cal-\nifornia itself had told EPA that the waiver was \u201ccritical \nfor incentivizing production and deployment of zero-\nemission vehicles.\u201d  Id. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237). \nAt oral argument, however, counsel for the state \nand local intervenors began making similar arguments \nunder the rubric of mootness.  California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles covered by California\u2019s \nwaiver\u2014that is, through model year 2025.  In response, \npetitioners moved to file a supplemental brief explain-\ning why their petitions were not moot, along with sup-\nplemental declarations from individuals experienced in \nvehicle-emissions compliance, who explained that \u201cau-\ntomobile manufacturers could and likely would change \ntheir production, pricing, and/or distribution plans for \nModel Year 2025 as late as December 2025, but at a \nminimum well into 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pet. Standing Adden-\ndum, Kreucher Decl. \u00b6 5. \n3. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  App., \ninfra, 30a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.  After all, petitioners had explained that \u201cby re-\nquiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s . . . requirements de-\npress the demand for liquid fuel.\u201d  Id. at 19a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  App., in-\nfra, 30a.  The court reasoned that petitioners\u2019 claims \nwere not \u201cmooted by the passage of time,\u201d but rather \n\n13 \n \n \nthat petitioners had lacked standing from the start.  Id. \nat 25a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to \npoint to any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that \nvacatur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that fewer would be sold.  Id. at \n23a.  According to the court, petitioners had thus failed \nto establish that\u2014even if the waiver had been vacated \nat the moment it was reinstated in 2022\u2014automakers \nwould have changed any production or prices before \nthe end of model year 2025.  Id. at 23a-24a.   \nThe court of appeals also declined to consider peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental declarations.  App., infra, 30a.  \nThe court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d to \nsupplement the record because petitioners could not \n\u201chave reasonably believed\u201d that \u201ctheir standing was \n\u2018self-evident\u2019 from the record\u201d when they filed their \nopening brief.  Id. at 31a.   \nFinally, the court of appeals rejected the States\u2019 \nequal-sovereignty argument on the merits.  App., in-\nfra, 49a.  The court concluded that the \u201cfundamental \nprinciple of equal sovereignty\u201d does not operate \u201cas a \nlimit on the Commerce Clause or other Article I pow-\ners.\u201d  Id. at 36a (citation omitted).  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION  \nWhen petitioners filed suit, EPA\u2019s waiver controlled \nfor the next four years.  As a matter of common sense, \nif that waiver were set aside and California were una-\nble to require automakers to produce electric vehicles \ninstead of liquid-fuel vehicles, automakers would make \nor sell at least one more liquid-fuel vehicle over the \ncourse of those four years.  That is the whole point of \nthis hard-fought litigation:  that the waiver would do \n\n14 \n \n \nsomething to reduce California vehicles\u2019 consumption \nof liquid fuel, which necessarily would shift at least a \ndollar of business away from liquid-fuel sellers.  In-\ndeed, the federal government\u2014never one shy about \nraising standing objections\u2014did not even contest peti-\ntioners\u2019 Article III standing.  Yet the court of appeals \nblinded itself to the obvious, and faulted petitioners for \nfailing to prove by affidavit how third-party automak-\ners would naturally behave. \nThis Court should grant review to ensure that the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 contrived standing decision does not \nimperil future challenges to administrative action.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 demand for record evidence of au-\ntomaker behavior cannot be squared with this Court\u2019s \nstanding decisions, and it conflicts with decisions from \nseveral courts of appeals.  Especially concerning, it \nwould chill many legitimate agency rule challenges \nthat hinge on third-party action. \nThis Court should also resolve the merits of peti-\ntioners\u2019 challenge to EPA\u2019s statutory authority, to-\ngether with the States\u2019 constitutional equal-sover-\neignty challenge.  For over a decade, the D.C. Circuit \nhas avoided resolving whether EPA has authority to \ngrant a preemption waiver to allow California to ad-\ndress global climate change.  The court of appeals\u2019 \ndodge of the merits here is just the latest installment.  \nEPA\u2019s (current) position that Congress granted Cali-\nfornia, alone among the States, the ability to set vehi-\ncle-emission standards to combat global climate \nchange is patently wrong, and raises serious constitu-\ntional issues for the reasons discussed in the States\u2019 an-\nticipated petition.  Without this Court\u2019s immediate re-\nview, California\u2019s unlawful standards will continue to \n\n15 \n \n \ndictate the composition of the Nation\u2019s automobile \nmarket.   \nI. THE D.C. CIRCUIT\u2019S STANDING DECISION \nWARRANTS THIS COURT\u2019S REVIEW \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \nIn the decision below, the D.C. Circuit erected bar-\nriers to demonstrating redressability that have no ba-\nsis in this Court\u2019s Article III jurisprudence.  These bar-\nriers are especially problematic in cases like this one, \nin which the agency action concerns a question of na-\ntional importance.  Such major questions should not be \nartificially insulated from judicial review. \n1. To demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat his \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A plaintiff \nseeking to demonstrate redressability does not need to \nestablish that a favorable judicial decision would com-\npletely cure his injury.  Rather, a judicial decision need \nonly \u201ctake steps to slow or reduce\u201d the injury.  Massa-\nchusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when \na plaintiff asserts an economic injury, he satisfies the \nredressability requirement if a favorable decision \nwould put even one dollar back in his pocket.  Uzueg-\nbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 292 (2021). \nWhen a plaintiff is the direct object of the chal-\nlenged regulation, there is usually little question that a \nfavorable decision from the court would provide re-\ndress.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-562.  The same \nshould be true when a plaintiff alleges an \u201cinjury pro-\n\n16 \n \n \nduced by determinative or coercive effect\u201d of the chal-\nlenged regulation \u201cupon the action of someone else.\u201d  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Thus, as \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh explained, if a plaintiff can \nshow that a favorable decision \u201cwould remove a regu-\nlatory hurdle\u201d to third-party conduct that would bene-\nfit the plaintiff, that is ordinarily \u201cenough to demon-\nstrate redressability.\u201d  Energy Future Coalition, \n793 F.3d at 141; see Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Gov-\nernors of the Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. __ (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[E]ntire clas-\nses of administrative litigation . . . have traditionally \nbeen brought by unregulated parties.\u201d).   \nEven when a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe un-\nfettered choices made by independent actors,\u201d rather \nthan a rule\u2019s \u201ccoercive or determinative effect,\u201d a plain-\ntiff still may establish standing, as long as he can \u201cad-\nduce facts showing that\u201d the third party will behave in \nsuch a way as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  This Court has explained that \na plaintiff may rely on \u201cthe predictable effect of Gov-\nernment action on the decisions of third parties,\u201d and \nhas not required affidavits detailing how third parties \nwill behave.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768 \n(emphasis added).  For example, it is predictable that \ngovernment regulation of one business \u201cmay cause \ndownstream or upstream economic injuries to others in \nthe chain.\u201d  FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. __ (2024) (slip op., at 12).  By contrast, stand-\ning may not rest on \u201cspeculation about the decisions of \nindependent actors\u201d when those decisions would be un-\nlawful or irrational.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThus, when a plaintiff\u2019s standing theory relies on \n\n17 \n \n \n\u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about third-party be-\nhavior, the plaintiff may need to support that theory \nwith \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California v. Texas, \n593 U.S. 659, 678 (2021). \nDepartment of Commerce illustrates the difference \nbetween predictable effects (which do not require ro-\nbust record evidence) and counterintuitive effects \n(which do).  There, the plaintiffs challenged the inclu-\nsion of a census question about citizenship, which they \ncontended would injure them by causing third-party \nnoncitizen households to decline to respond to the cen-\nsus.  588 U.S. at 766-767.  This Court concluded that \nthose effects were sufficiently predictable to establish \nthe causation element of standing\u2014which, like the re-\ndressability element, turns on the effect of government \naction (or its removal).  Id. at 768; see Alliance for Hip-\npocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at __ (slip op., at 8) \n(\u201c[C]ausation and redressability . . . are often flip sides \nof the same coin.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Court did not hold that affidavits from noncitizens \nattesting that they did not plan to participate in the \ncensus were required.  The Court found it sufficient \nthat noncitizen households had responded to the cen-\nsus at lower rates in the past, and credited the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 common-sense prediction that noncitizens would \nrespond at even lower rates if the census asked about \ntheir citizenship.  See 588 U.S. at 768. \nAn effect of agency action is \u201cpredictable,\u201d rather \nthan \u201ccounterintuitive,\u201d when the agency itself intends \nor presupposes that effect.  In Massachusetts, for ex-\nample, this Court relied on EPA\u2019s own statements and \nprograms to find that ordering EPA to set emission \nstandards would redress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  549 U.S. \n\n18 \n \n \nat 526.  The Court observed that EPA promoted volun-\ntary emissions-reductions programs, and \u201cwould pre-\nsumably not bother with such efforts,\u201d unless it \nthought that emissions reductions would have some ef-\nfect on the environment.  Ibid.  In other words, an \nagency\u2019s own assumptions about the design of its rule \nare strong evidence of the rule\u2019s predictable effects. \n2. The decision below departs from this Court\u2019s \nsensible approach to redressability.  First, petitioners\u2019 \ninjury arises from the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on third-party automak-\ners.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  By requiring automak-\ners to produce vehicles that consume less or no liquid \nfuel, California\u2019s standards and EPA\u2019s waiver pose a \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products that a \nfavorable decision would redress.  Under this Court\u2019s \ncases, no more is needed.  \nBut even if petitioners had to show more, the pre-\ndictable effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is obvi-\nous:  automakers will make and sell more electric vehi-\ncles to comply with California\u2019s regulations.  Other-\nwise, California and EPA \u201cwould presumably not \nbother with such efforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at \n526.  If the regulations go away, then the government \nwill no longer be forcing automakers to sell more elec-\ntric vehicles than they would otherwise produce in re-\nsponse to market forces.  So automakers will make \nmore vehicles that run on liquid fuel, or they will adjust \ntheir prices in response to consumer demand.  That is \nEconomics 101, not a proposition that requires an affi-\ndavit for support. \nThe contrast with this Court\u2019s recent decision in \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. __ (2024), further illus-\n\n19 \n \n \ntrates the point.  Murthy involved several circum-\nstances that may call redressability into question\u2014\nnone of which is present here.  First, Murthy did not \ninvolve direct government regulation.  Here, whatever \nindependent incentives automakers may have to in-\ncrease electric-vehicle production, compliance with \nCalifornia\u2019s standards is mandatory.  Second, in \nMurthy the government\u2019s alleged influence might not \nhave mattered at all.  Id., slip op., at 12.  Here, the \nwhole point of California\u2019s standards (and EPA\u2019s \nwaiver) is to require electrification beyond what the \nmarket was demanding.  Third, and what the Court in \nMurthy called the \u201ckey point,\u201d id. at 25 n.10, the gov-\nernment action there had concluded by the time suit \nwas brought.  There was no obvious ongoing harm for \nthe courts to correct, and so this Court could only \n\u201cspeculat[e]\u201d about redressability.  Id. at 22, 24-\n25.  Here, California\u2019s standards and mandate were re-\ninstated just months before petitioners brought suit \nand are still in place today.  Unlike Murthy, this is a \ncase where redressability should be beyond question.   \nThe court of appeals nevertheless demanded that \nthe fuel-manufacturer petitioners supply additional ev-\nidence of automakers\u2019 plans.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that automakers \nwould change their plans and sell more liquid-fuel ve-\nhicles, it faulted petitioners for failing to supply \u201crec-\nord evidence,\u201d such as \u201cadditional affidavits.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 24a (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 standing decla-\nrations already pointed out that California itself had \nprojected that a waiver would \u201creduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u201d  C.A. Pet. \nStanding Addendum, Swenton Decl. at 5-6 (citation \n\n20 \n \n \nomitted).  They further explained that petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries would be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nC.A. Pet. Standing Addendum, Swenton Decl. at 7.  An-\nother declaration from the California Air Resources \nBoard projected that without the standards, \u201caddi-\ntional gasoline-fueled vehicles\u201d would likely be \u201cpro-\nduced and sold during these model years.\u201d  C.A. States\u2019 \nInt. Mot., Vanderspek Decl. \u00b6 22.  But that was not \nenough for the court of appeals.  In context, it appears \nthat the only kind of evidence the court would have \nfound sufficient is an affidavit from an automaker it-\nself, promising to change its production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.   \nThat requirement is doubly wrong.  First, the court \nof appeals did not even acknowledge Bennett or De-\npartment of Commerce, or recognize that this Court \nhas allowed plaintiffs to draw logical inferences about \nrational economic behavior in assessing causation and \nredressability.  The court below did not ask whether \nthe withdrawal of a special regulatory license to Cali-\nfornia will have \u201cpredictable effects\u201d on vehicle sales.  \nDepartment of Commerce, 558 U.S. at 768.  It simply \nassumed that every effect must match up to a line in an \naffidavit. \nSecond, making matters worse, the court of appeals \nappeared to require plaintiffs to obtain affidavits from \nthe directly regulated parties\u2014here, the automakers.  \nBut directly regulated parties may have good reasons \nfor not wanting to participate in the litigation.  Maybe \nthey intend to pass on the costs, or the government has \ngarnered their complicity with some carrot that makes \nup for the regulatory stick.  Indeed, that is exactly \nwhat happened here, as several automakers entered \ninto \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d committing \n\n21 \n \n \nthemselves to acceding to California\u2019s standards in ex-\nchange for certain benefits, like additional lead time.  \nC.A. Resp.-Int. Br. 4.  \nPetitioners\u2019 standing to challenge an agency action \nshould not depend on automakers\u2019 current preferences \nto partner with them.  The contrary rule adopted below \ncreates an unworkable hurdle to establishing standing \nin agency rule challenges\u2014one with no basis in prece-\ndent or logic.   \n3.  The court\u2019s flawed approach could doom any \nchallenge to a similar time-limited agency rule that re-\nquires some lead time to implement.  Petitioners sued \nwithin 60 days of EPA\u2019s March 2022 order.  Yet the \ncourt held that petitioners already could not obtain ef-\nfective relief because of the waiver\u2019s \u201crelatively short,\u201d \nfour-year \u201cduration.\u201d  App., infra, 22a; see Davis v. \nFEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (standing is assessed as \nof the date \u201cwhen the suit was filed\u201d).  Additionally, by \ngrounding its determination in standing, rather than \nmootness, the court dismissed the case without even \nholding EPA to its burden of establishing mootness or \nconsidering exceptions. \nB. The Decision Below Creates A Conflict \nAmong The Courts Of Appeals  \nBy imposing artificial hurdles on Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement, the court of appeals split \nfrom several other courts of appeals.  The Second, \nFifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits\u2014and even the D.C. \nCircuit in other cases\u2014have all found standing based \non a law\u2019s coercive or predictable effects on third par-\nties, without requiring the sort of record evidence de-\nmanded below.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach in \n\n22 \n \n \nthis case, those cases would have been (wrongly) dis-\nmissed on standing grounds.  \nThe Second Circuit has found standing based on a \nrule\u2019s predictable effects on third parties, without re-\nquiring third-party affidavits or similar evidence.  In \nNRDC v. NHTSA, 894 F.3d 95 (2018), the court of ap-\npeals considered an environmental group\u2019s challenge \nto NHTSA\u2019s decision to delay a rule increasing civil \npenalties for violations of fuel-economy standards.  The \npetitioners asserted an environmental injury based on \nthe assumption that third-party automakers would be \nless compliant when civil penalties were lower.  Id. at \n104.  In finding standing, the court relied on \u201ccommon \nsense and basic economics,\u201d which \u201ctell us that the in-\ncreased cost of unlawful conduct will make that conduct \nless common.\u201d  Id. at 105.  Automaker intervenors \nthere had posited that penalties \u201cha[d] the potential\u201d \nto affect their decisions, ibid., but the court did not de-\nmand affidavits proving how automakers would be-\nhave. \nThe Fifth Circuit has followed the same approach.  \nIn General Land Office v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264 (2023), \nthe court of appeals considered Texas\u2019s challenge to \nthe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision to di-\nvert funds appropriated for the construction of a wall \nalong the United States\u2013Mexico border.  Texas as-\nserted injuries premised on the assumption that the di-\nversion of funds would cause more unlawful immigra-\ntion.  Without requiring affidavits from undocumented \nimmigrants, the Fifth Circuit adopted the common-\nsense point that \u201c[i]n the absence of longer walls, at \nleast some illegal aliens who otherwise would have \nbeen prevented from entering Texas will seek\u201d benefits \nfrom the State.  Id. at 273.   \n\n23 \n \n \nThe Eighth Circuit, too, has relied on the predicta-\nble effects on third parties to find an injury redressa-\nble, without requiring a third-party affidavit.  Wieland \nv. Department of Health & Human Services, 793 F.3d \n949 (2015), involved a challenge to provisions of the Af-\nfordable Care Act that required certain insurers to \ncover contraceptive services.  Plaintiffs, who wanted a \ncontraception-free option, satisfied the redressability \nrequirement, because although an order enjoining \nthose laws would not require insurers to offer a  \ncontraception-free option, it was \u201clikely\u201d that insurers \nwould respond that way.  Id. at 957.   \nThe Ninth Circuit has applied similar reasoning.  It \nfound standing for plaintiffs challenging a California \ndirective that required certain insurers to offer abor-\ntion coverage.  See Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cali-\nfornia Dep\u2019t of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, \n750 (2020).  The court of appeals did not demand affi-\ndavits from the insurers, concluding both that the di-\nrective had a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the \ninsurers, and that \u201cthe predictable effect\u201d of a favora-\nble judicial decision included that \u201cat least one insurer \nwould be willing to sell\u201d a plan without abortion cover-\nage.  Ibid. \nThe decision below is not even faithful to the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s own standing precedent.  In Energy Future \nCoalition, 793 F.3d 141, a case with strikingly parallel \nfacts to this one, the D.C. Circuit held that fuel produc-\ners had standing to challenge an EPA rule effectively \nbanning vehicle manufacturers from using certain fuel \nin emissions testing.  Id. at 144.  In an opinion by then-\nJudge Kavanaugh, the court held that the plaintiffs had \nestablished redressability, reasoning that \u201cif EPA per-\nmitted vehicle manufacturers to use\u201d the contested test \n\n24 \n \n \nfuel, \u201cthere is substantial reason to think that at least \nsome vehicle manufacturers would use it.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt credited the common-sense, predictable effects \nof EPA\u2019s rule on third parties.  Yet here, after criticiz-\ning petitioners for believing their standing was \u201cself-\nevident\u201d under existing precedent, App., infra, 31a, the \ncourt below failed to even address this precedent on \nwhich petitioners\u2019 standing argument was based. \nUltimately, the court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case \ncannot be squared with any of the above decisions.  In \neach of them, the court relied on common-sense infer-\nences about how third parties behave in response to le-\ngal barriers to certain behavior.  None of them de-\nmanded the specific factual showing that the court re-\nquired here.  This Court should correct the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s outlier position before it sows significant confu-\nsion in this area. \nC. The Question Presented Is Important And \nWarrants Review In This Case \nThe question presented is exceptionally important, \nand this case presents an appropriate vehicle to con-\nsider it. \n1. The decision below threatens to chill legitimate \nchallenges to agency action.  The D.C. Circuit has tra-\nditionally served as the primary home for litigation un-\nder the Administrative Procedure Act, and it is the ex-\nclusive venue for challenges to emission standards un-\nder the Clean Air Act.  That makes its new barrier to \nagency challenges especially problematic.  As the deci-\nsions in the circuit split illustrate, there are many cir-\ncumstances in which third parties directly regulated by \nan agency rule have different incentives from an in-\n\n25 \n \n \njured petitioner.  Here, the preferences of car manu-\nfacturers and fuel manufacturers may diverge, includ-\ning because car manufacturers have been offered some \nregulatory flexibility that benefits them but not fuel \nproducers.  In other cases, a similar dynamic may arise \nbetween businesses and consumers, insurers and in-\nsured parties, and any number of other sets of potential \npetitioners.  If every regulatory petitioner in the D.C. \nCircuit must secure the cooperation of a directly regu-\nlated party to establish standing, a significant swath of \nchallenges may be doomed from the start. \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s unnecessary and unprecedented \nhurdle also creates bad incentives for agencies.  Under \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s rule, agencies could intentionally \nstructure their actions to placate directly regulated \nparties and thereby foreclose future litigation.  Those \nactions would still have sweeping effect, but the di-\nrectly regulated parties\u2014who would be the only  \npotential plaintiffs\u2014would have no incentive to sue.  \nThe result is an agency roadmap of particular concern \nbecause it insulates even major decisions like this one \nfrom judicial review. \nAt bottom, the entire purpose of California\u2019s stand-\nards and EPA\u2019s waiver determination is to reduce  \nliquid-fuel usage and mandate electrification.  That \ngoal is existential to the liquid-fuel industry, even if it \ndoes not immediately threaten car manufacturers.  \nFuel manufacturers are the obvious parties to chal-\nlenge the regulations.  The fact that fuel producers are \nnot directly regulated, when they are the direct target \nof the regulations, should not prevent them from estab-\nlishing their standing to sue. \n\n26 \n \n \n2. This case presents an appropriate vehicle for ad-\ndressing this important issue.  The redressability ques-\ntion determines petitioners\u2019 standing, as neither the \ncourt of appeals nor EPA has questioned petitioners\u2019 \nshowing of injury or causation.  See App., infra, 20a.  \nEPA has raised concerns about mootness, see id. at \n25a, but the Court can decide this case before it be-\ncomes moot.  The party asserting mootness \u201cbears the \nburden to establish\u201d that the case \u201chas become moot.\u201d  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  To meet that burden, \nEPA would have to show that \u201cit is impossible\u201d for the \nCourt \u201cto grant any effectual relief.\u201d  United States v. \nWashington, 596 U.S. 832, 837 (2022) (emphasis \nadded).  It is far from impossible here:  if this Court \ngrants certiorari in October Term 2024, it will presum-\nably render a decision before model year 2025 ends.  \nAnd even if EPA could somehow establish mootness, \nthis case would fall within the capable-of-repetition ex-\nception because of the order\u2019s relatively short duration \nand the likelihood that petitioners will be \u201csubjected to \nthe same action again\u201d when EPA issues future waiv-\ners.  United States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 584 U.S. 381, 391 \n(2018).   \nII. THIS COURT SHOULD ALSO REACH THE \nMERITS AND VACATE THE WAIVER  \nThis Court should also grant the second question \npresented and decide whether EPA has the authority \nto grant California a preemption waiver to address \nglobal climate change.  Because California\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025, it is quite possible \nthe D.C. Circuit will not decide the merits on remand \nin time for this Court\u2019s subsequent review.  This EPA \nwill no doubt take the same approach to its next waiver \n\n27 \n \n \ndeterminations, and petitioners will then spend years \nsuffering ongoing injury from California\u2019s next set of \nunlawful standards and mandates.  Reaching the mer-\nits now would avoid that serious unfairness.  EPA is \nwrong on the merits, and there is no reason to wait ad-\nditional years to resolve an issue the D.C. Circuit has \npunted for over a decade. \nA. EPA\u2019s Decision Is Wrong \nThe Clean Air Act does not authorize the preemp-\ntion waiver that EPA granted here.  Section 209(a) es-\ntablishes federal control over motor-vehicle-emission \nstandards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  Because of California\u2019s \nunique \u201csmog problem,\u201d Section 209(b) gives that State \nalone the right to set its own emission standards.  Mo-\ntor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. New York \nState Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Conservation, 17 F.3d 521, 526 (2d \nCir. 1994).  But Congress\u2019s baseline was nationwide \npreemption, and it tailored California\u2019s special exemp-\ntion accordingly.  As a result, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards are \u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions\u201d in California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B). \nThe California regulations here do not meet the \nstatutory criteria.  First, California\u2019s standards do not \ntarget conditions \u201cextraordinary\u201d to California be-\ncause they were created to address global climate \nchange, which is by definition not a phenomenon par-\nticular to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its separate standards to \u201cmeet\u201d those condi-\ntions because, by EPA\u2019s own admission, the standards \nwill not materially reduce the impacts of climate \nchange in California or anywhere else.  And EPA\u2019s pri-\n\n28 \n \n \nmary defense\u2014that California needs its \u201cwhole pro-\ngram,\u201d even if not these particular standards\u2014lacks \nany basis in the text or common sense. \n1. Global \nclimate \nchange \nis \nnot \nan  \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nCalifornia \ncondition \nwithin the meaning of Section 209 \nThe Clean Air Act\u2019s text, structure, and history \ndemonstrate that the phrase \u201ccompelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions\u201d refers to California\u2019s distinctive lo-\ncal pollution problems; it does not encompass condi-\ntions with global cause and effect, like climate change. \na. California\u2019s separate emission standards must be \nneeded to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  The plain meaning of \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d is \u201cmost unusual.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New In-\nternational Dictionary 807 (3d ed. 1961).  On its own, \nthat definition could mean \u201cmost unusual\u201d compared to \nordinary pollution problems or \u201cmost unusual\u201d com-\npared to other States\u2019 problems.  In context, it must \nmean the latter.  The Clean Air Act pairs \u201cextraordi-\nnary\u201d with \u201ccompelling,\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d already \ncaptures a sense of magnitude.  To avoid rendering \u201cex-\ntraordinary\u201d redundant, it must mean \u201cmost unusual\u201d \nas compared to other States.  \nRelated statutory provisions support reading the \nphrase \u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d to encompass \nsevere local conditions.  For example, Section 177 au-\nthorizes other States to adopt California\u2019s standards as \npart of approved plans for combatting the six criteria \npollutants that cause local pollution problems.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507.  Congress thus plainly contemplated \nthat the standards California would adopt under Sec-\n\n29 \n \n \ntion 209(b)\u2014that other States might copy under Sec-\ntion 177\u2014would help States attain local ambient air-\nquality standards within their respective borders.   \nMore generally, the structure of Section 209 makes \nclear that Section 209(b) is an exception from a uniform \nfederal regulatory regime.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  It \nwould make little sense to permit California to function \nas a junior-varsity EPA and deviate from a national \nregulatory framework to address conditions that are \nbroadly shared throughout the Nation. \nSection 209(b)\u2019s history and purpose confirm that it \nauthorizes preemption waivers only for California \nstandards aimed at local air-quality issues.  In drafting \nTitle II, Congress repeatedly identified California\u2019s \n\u201cpeculiar\u201d circumstances: its \u201cunique problems\u201d re-\nsulting from local emissions and pollution concentra-\ntions interacting with the State\u2019s distinctive \u201cclimate \nand topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 22 (1967).  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained decades ago, \u201cclearly the \nintent\u201d of the waiver provision was to \u201cfocus on local \nair quality problems\u201d that \u201cmay differ substantially \nfrom those in other parts of the nation.\u201d  Ford Motor \nCo. v. EPA, 606 F.2d 1293, 1303 (1979) (emphasis \nadded).   \nb. Global climate change is not a condition \u201cextraor-\ndinary\u201d to California.  By definition, global climate \nchange is neither unique to California nor uniquely felt \nby the State.  As EPA found in 2019, when it comes to \nthe effects of climate change, California is not \u201cworse-\npositioned in relation to certain other areas.\u201d  84 Fed. \nReg. at 51,348 n.278.  In fact, \u201c[m]any parts of the \nUnited States, especially western States, may have is-\nsues [caused by climate change] related to drinking wa-\nter\u201d and \u201cwildfires, and effects on agriculture.\u201d  Id. at \n\n30 \n \n \n51,348.  In other words, \u201ceffects related to climate \nchange in California\u201d are \u201cnot sufficiently different \nfrom the conditions in the nation as a whole to justify \nseparate State standards.\u201d  Id. at 51,344.  EPA did not \nrevisit that finding in 2022.  The agency thus provided \nno basis to depart from its prior conclusion, let alone \nthe heightened showing necessary for a reversal. \nTo be sure, EPA argued below that California\u2019s \nstandards do address local conditions because they \nmay have side effects on local criteria pollution.  But \nthat argument is wrong both legally and factually.  As \na legal matter, EPA cannot contrive a new goal for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards not presented in California\u2019s waiver \napplication.  No one disputes that the express purpose \nof California\u2019s standards was to regulate global climate \nchange.  Moreover, EPA\u2019s argument is not supported \nby the factual record.  In the waiver reinstatement, \nEPA relied on the \u201clogical link\u201d between ozone pollu-\ntion and greenhouse gases\u2014namely, that ozone levels \nare \u201cexacerbate[d]\u201d by higher temperatures caused by \nglobal warming.  App., infra, 207a-208a.  But EPA pre-\nviously found that the State\u2019s rules would produce \n\u201clikely no change\u201d to climate-change conditions\u2014in-\ncluding rising temperatures\u2014in California.  84 Fed. \nReg. at 51,341.  If California\u2019s standards will not \nchange temperatures, then they cannot affect ozone \nlevels under EPA\u2019s \u201clogical link\u201d theory either. \n2. California does not \u201cneed\u201d its own  \nemission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-\nchange conditions  \nEven if California faced \u201cextraordinary\u201d conditions \nwithin the meaning of Section 209(b) from global cli-\nmate change, it does not \u201cneed\u201d its greenhouse-gas \n\n31 \n \n \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to \n\u201cmeet\u201d those conditions.  To the contrary, as EPA ex-\nplained in 2019, California\u2019s standards \u201cwill not mean-\ningfully address global air pollution problems of the \nsort associated with [greenhouse-gas] emissions.\u201d  \n84 Fed. Reg. at 51,347, 51,349.   \na. A Section 209(b) waiver is authorized when \n\u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet\u201d conditions in California\u2014that is, \nonly if the proposed California emission standards \nwould appreciably affect the conditions that warrant \nthem.  That accords with the ordinary meaning of the \nstatutory terms \u201cneed\u201d and \u201cmeet.\u201d  The verb \u201cneed\u201d \nmeans to \u201cbe necessary.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New International \nDictionary, supra, at 1512.  And the term \u201cnecessary\u201d \ntypically means \u201cessential; indispensable.\u201d  American \nHeritage Dictionary 877 (1st ed. 1969).  The verb \n\u201cmeet\u201d is complementary.  In this context, it means to \n\u201csatisfy (a demand, need, obligation).\u201d  Id. at 816.   \nPutting the terms together, two things are clear.  \nFirst, California must \u201cneed\u201d\u2014i.e., require as essential \nor very important\u2014specific standards that differ from \nfederal standards.  Second, California\u2019s standards \nmust meaningfully address the conditions that give rise \nto California\u2019s need for separate standards.  At a mini-\nmum, if the State\u2019s proposed standards have no impact \non those conditions, then they cannot be said to be nec-\nessary, essential, or indispensable to \u201cmeet\u201d the condi-\ntions the State faces.  \nb. Based on EPA\u2019s own undisturbed factual find-\nings, California does not satisfy that standard for a \npreemption waiver.  In vacating California\u2019s waiver, \nEPA previously found that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards would \u201clea[d] to little to no change\u201d in  \n\u201c[greenhouse-gas] emissions at a national level,\u201d and \n\n32 \n \n \n\u201cwould result in an indistinguishable change in global \ntemperatures\u201d and \u201clikely no change in temperatures \nor physical impacts resulting from anthropogenic cli-\nmate change in California.\u201d  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,341, \n51,353 (emphases added).  Critically, in reinstating the \nwaiver, EPA did not disturb these findings about the \nfutility of California\u2019s standards.   \n3. EPA\u2019s whole-program approach is wrong \nIn defending its reinstatement decision, EPA has \nprimarily argued that Section 209(b)(1)(B)\u2014which \npermits EPA to grant a preemption waiver only if \n\u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet\u201d \u201ccompelling and extraordinary \nconditions\u201d\u2014is effectively irrelevant.  Under EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwhole program\u201d approach, so long as California needs \nany separate standards at all\u2014say, to combat smog\u2014\nthe State has satisfied the \u201cneed[s] . . . to meet\u201d re-\nquirement.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,335.  At that point, \nCalifornia can add on any other emission standards it \nwants and tackle global problems as it sees fit. \nEPA\u2019s whole-program approach is atextual and de-\nfies common sense.  EPA relies on language elsewhere \nin Section 209(b) requiring that California \u201cdeter-\nmine[] that the State standards will be, in the aggre-\ngate, at least as protective of public health and welfare \nas applicable [federal] standards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1) (emphasis added).  But Section 209(b)\u2019s \u201cin \nthe aggregate\u201d language does not carry down to the \nrest of 209(b).  For example, Subsection (b)(1)(C) re-\nquires EPA to ensure that manufacturers have suffi-\ncient lead time to meet California\u2019s standards.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(2).  EPA does not assess whether \nmanufacturers would have adequate lead time \u201cin the \naggregate\u201d\u2014that would make no sense.  See 84 Fed. \n\n33 \n \n \nReg. at 51,332; see also C.A. Pet. Br. 46.  Similarly, \nEPA has a separate duty in Section 209(b)(1)(B) to de-\ntermine whether California \u201cneed[s] such State stand-\nards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  That determination, like the \nneighboring lead-time determination, is not done \u201cin \nthe aggregate.\u201d \nEPA\u2019s reading would also make the Section \n209(b)(1)(B) criteria meaningless. Congress already \ndetermined that California \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emissions \nprogram by creating the preemption exception in the \nfirst place.  On EPA\u2019s view, however, subsection \n(b)(1)(B) serves no independent purpose so long as Cal-\nifornia has any air-quality issues.  This assertion can-\nnot withstand minimal scrutiny, as the D.C. Circuit \npanel appeared to recognize at oral argument.  See C.A. \nOral Arg. Tr. 45:30 (Wilkins, J., criticizing EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwhole program\u201d approach).  \n4. Clear-statement rules favor petitioners\u2019 \nreading \nEven if EPA\u2019s interpretation were possible, several \nclear-statement rules require petitioners\u2019 reading. \nFirst, principles of constitutional avoidance require \npetitioners\u2019 reading.  The State petitioners have ar-\ngued that Section 209(b) deviates from the \u201cfundamen-\ntal principle of equality of the states under the Consti-\ntution.\u201d  Bolln v. Nebraska, 176 U.S. 83, 89 (1900).  This \nequal-sovereignty question is at least a serious one, \nand this Court should adopt a more modest interpreta-\ntion of California\u2019s waiver authority to avoid it.  Solid \nWaste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng\u2019rs, 531 U.S. 159, 160 (2001).  Even if Congress \ncould grant California the unique ability to address a \n\n34 \n \n \nlocal problem, it would be a far graver intrusion on \nequal-sovereignty principles to grant California alone \nthe ability to address global climate change.  Cf. South \nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 328-329 (1964) \n(\u201cThe doctrine of the equality of States\u201d does not bar \n\u201cremedies for local evils which have subsequently ap-\npeared.\u201d).   \nSecond, the major-questions doctrine applies to Cal-\nifornia\u2019s efforts to tackle global climate change and \nforce a transition to electric vehicles.  This Court \u201cex-\npect[s] Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign \nto an agency decisions of \u2018vast economic and political \nsignificance.\u2019\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, \n573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (citation omitted).  On EPA\u2019s \nview, Section 209 authorizes the agency to permit Cal-\nifornia to adopt vehicle-emission standards to tackle \nclimate change, and to force a transition to electric ve-\nhicles that would have enormous repercussions for the \nnational economy, the States\u2019 electric grids, and na-\ntional security.  This Court should \u201cgreet\u201d EPA\u2019s \u201cas-\nsertions of \u2018extravagant statutory power over the na-\ntional economy\u2019 with \u2018skepticism.\u2019\u201d  West Virginia,  \n597 U.S. at 724 (citation omitted). \nThird, the federalism canon points in the same di-\nrection.  Congress must be \u201cunmistakably clear in the \nlanguage of the statute\u201d if it \u201cintends to alter the \u2018usual \nconstitutional balance between the States and the Fed-\neral government.\u2019\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n460-461 (1991) (citation omitted).  Yet under EPA\u2019s \nview, California alone among the States can regulate \nthe nation\u2019s automobile market in the service of ad-\ndressing climate change and forcing a transition to \nelectric vehicles. \n\n35 \n \n \nB. The Question Presented Is Important, Is  \nImplicated In The States\u2019 Petition, And  \nRepeatedly Evades Review \nThe extent of EPA\u2019s authority to grant California a \npreemption waiver warrants this Court\u2019s immediate \nreview.  It is a question that shapes the direction of the \nentire country\u2019s automobile industry but that has re-\npeatedly evaded judicial scrutiny.  And it is a question \nantecedent to the constitutional issue that the court of \nappeals reached and that is the subject of the State pe-\ntitioners\u2019 concurrent challenge. \n1.  Section 209(b), if construed to allow California \nto tackle nationwide issues like global climate change, \nbecomes a huge source of power to regulate the coun-\ntry\u2019s economy.  California is a significant market in its \nown right, and 17 States and the District of Columbia \nhave opted into at least some of California\u2019s standards.  \nSee supra, p. 10.  Additionally, both EPA and NHTSA \nhave relied on California\u2019s standards in setting their \nrespective (and unlawful) vehicle-emission standards \naimed at forcing electrification.  See 86 Fed. Reg. \n74,434, 74,457-74,458 (Dec. 30, 2021); 87 Fed. Reg. \n25,710, 25,762-25,765 (May 2, 2022).  No wonder Cali-\nfornia\u2019s governor described its vehicle-emission rules \nas \u201cone of the most significant steps to the elimination \nof the tailpipe as we know it.\u201d  Coral Davenport et al., \nCalifornia to Ban the Sale of New Gasoline Cars, N.Y. \nTimes (Aug. 24, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/ \n08/24/climate/california-gas-cars-emissions.html. \nA wait-and-see approach would embolden California \nto stretch Section 209(b) even further.  Since petition-\ners brought this case, California has adopted its \nso-called Advanced Clean Cars II standards, along \nwith Advanced Clean Fleets and Advanced Clean \n\n36 \n \n \nTrucks rules, which collectively mandate 100% electri-\nfication of every class of new vehicles by 2036.  See \nCARB, Public Hearing to Consider the Proposed Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II Regulations 12 (Apr. 12, 2022), \nhttp://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/barcu/regact/2022 \n/accii/isor.pdf.  EPA\u2019s waiver thus enables California to \nforce automakers to electrify their entire fleets in Cal-\nifornia and any State that adopts its standards. \n2. This Court should also grant review of the sec-\nond question because the States\u2019 anticipated petition \npresents a serious constitutional question that should \nbe considered together with petitioners\u2019 statutory chal-\nlenge.  The State petitioners are challenging the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision holding that Section 209 does not vi-\nolate the principle of equal sovereignty.  Unless this \nCourt grants review of both questions presented here, \nthe Court will not have complete briefing on a narrower \nstatutory alternative to resolving the States\u2019 constitu-\ntional challenge.   \n3. Finally, this Court should hear the second ques-\ntion presented because it has for too long evaded this \nCourt\u2019s review and may otherwise continue to do so.  \nThe challenged waiver is in effect only through model \nyear 2025.  That means that there will likely be time for \na merits decision in this Court, or a remand and poten-\ntial merits decision in the court of appeals, but not both \nwithout having to litigate mootness issues that may \ncomplicate this Court\u2019s review.  \nPetitioners have endured decades of regulatory \nwhiplash only for the D.C. Circuit to repeatedly reject \nany legal challenges on threshold grounds.  Absent this \nCourt\u2019s review, petitioners will be back at square one, \nhaving to litigate additional challenges to EPA\u2019s next \nwaiver, all while suffering ongoing injury.  Critical \n\n37 \n \n \nAmerican industries deserve the certainty that can \nonly be provided by this Court\u2019s finally defining the ex-\ntent of EPA\u2019s authority under Section 209(b).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

REGAN, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE U.S. \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, \nRespondents, \nADVANCED ENERGY UNITED, et al., \nIntervenors\nSeptember 15, 2023, Argued; April 9, 2024, Decided\nOn Petitions for Review of a Final Action \nof the Environmental Protection Agency \n(1a)\n\n2a\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nBefore: Wilkins, Childs, and Garcia, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.\nPer Curiam: These consolidated petitions for review \nconcern a 2022 decision by the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to reinstate the EPA\u2019s prior decision, \nin 2013, to waive federal preemption of two California \nregulations regarding automobile emissions under the \nClean Air Act. The regulations in question are a standard \nlimiting greenhouse gas emissions and a requirement that \na certain percentage of new vehicles manufactured in the \nstate each year be zero-emissions vehicles (\u201cZEV\u201d), see \n13 Cal. Code Regs. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01961.3, 1962.2, respectively. Two \nsets of Petitioners challenge the EPA\u2019s decision. The \nfirst group of Petitioners comprises seventeen states \n(\u201cState Petitioners\u201d).1 The second group of Petitioners \nincludes entities that produce or sell liquid fuels and the \nraw materials used to produce those fuels, along with \nassociations whose members include such entities (\u201cFuel \nPetitioners\u201d).2 Both State and Fuel Petitioners claim that \n1.\u2002 State Petitioners are the State of Ohio, State of Alabama, \nState of Arkansas, State of Georgia, State of Indiana, State of \nKansas, Commonwealth of Kentucky, State of Louisiana, State of \nMississippi, State of Missouri, State of Montana, State of Nebraska, \nState of Oklahoma, State of South Carolina, State of Texas, State of \nUtah, and State of West Virginia.\n2.\u2002 Fuel Petitioners are American Fuel & Petrochemical \nManufacturers, Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Diamond \nAlternative Energy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \n\n3a\nthe EPA was not authorized to grant California the waiver \nunder the Clean Air Act. Fuel Petitioners argue that the \nEPA exceeded its statutory authority under the Clean \nAir Act. State Petitioners, meanwhile, contend that the \nEPA\u2019s waiver reinstatement decision was contrary to law \nbecause the relevant California regulations are preempted \nby a separate federal statute, the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act of 1975 (\u201cEPCA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a032919(a). \nState Petitioners also claim that by granting a waiver \nto California alone, the EPA violated a constitutional \nrequirement that the federal government treat states \nequally in terms of their sovereign authority. We hold that \nFuel Petitioners lack standing to raise their statutory \nclaim, and that State Petitioners lack standing to raise \ntheir preemption claim, because neither set of Petitioners \nhas demonstrated that their claimed injuries would be \nredressed by a favorable decision by this Court. While \nwe hold that State Petitioners have standing to raise their \nconstitutional claim, we reject it on the merits.\nI.\nA.\nWhile the Clean Air Act typically grants states broad \ndiscretion to meet federal air quality goals, emissions \nstandards for new automobiles are promulgated at the \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn Growers \nAssociation, Iowa Soybean Association, Kansas Corn Growers \nAssociation, Michigan Corn Growers Association, Minnesota \nSoybean Growers Association, Missouri Corn Growers Association, \nNational Association of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean \nAssociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC.\n\n4a\nfederal level. The Clean Air Act empowers the EPA to \npromulgate federal emissions standards for those vehicles, \nsee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521, and it preempts any corresponding \nstate regulation, expressly preventing the adoption of \nemissions standards for new vehicles and/or engines as \nfollows:\n(a) Prohibition\nNo State or any political subdivision thereof \nshall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard \nrelating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines \nsubject to this part. No State shall require \ncertification, inspection, or any other approval \nrelating to the control of emissions from any \nnew motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine \nas condition precedent to the initial retail sale, \ntitling (if any), or registration of such motor \nvehicle, motor vehicle engine, or equipment.\nId. \u00a7\u00a07543(a) (\u201cSection 209(a)\u201d). However, the Clean Air \nAct permits the EPA to waive application of Section 209(a) \nto any state under certain circumstances:\n(b) Waiver\n(1) The Administrator shall, after notice \nand opportunity for public hearing, waive \napplication of this section to any State which \nhas adopted standards (other than crankcase \nemission standards) for the control of emissions \n\n5a\nfrom new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle \nengines prior to March 30, 1966, if the State \ndetermines that the State standards will be, \nin the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards. No such waiver shall be granted if \nthe Administrator finds that\u2014\n(A) the determination of the State is \narbitrary and capricious,\n(B) such State does not need such State \nstandards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions, or\n(C) such State standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith section 7521(a) of this title.\n(2) If each State standard is at least as stringent \nas the comparable applicable Federal standard, \nsuch State standard shall be deemed to be at \nleast as protective of health and welfare as such \nFederal standards for purposes of paragraph \n(1).\n(3) In the case of any new motor vehicle or new \nmotor vehicle engine to which State standards \napply pursuant to a waiver granted under \nparagraph (1), compliance with such State \nstandards shall be treated as compliance with \napplicable Federal standards for purposes of \nthis subchapter.\n\n6a\nId. \u00a7\u00a07543(b) (\u201cSection 209(b)\u201d). California is the only \nstate that had adopted standards (other than crankcase \nemission standards) for the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines as of March \n30, 1966. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d \n1095, 1100 n.1, 201 U.S. App. D.C. 109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).\nIf California applies to promulgate automobile \nemissions standards that it has determined are at least \nas protective of public health and welfare as the existing \nfederal regulations, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to \nwaive preemption as to those regulations, unless certain \ncriteria (the \u201cwaiver denial criteria\u201d) are met. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07543(b). The EPA may refuse to grant a waiver only if: (1) \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cdetermination .\u00a0.\u00a0. is arbitrary and capricious,\u201d \n(2) California \u201cdoes not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d or (3) the \n\u201cstandards and accompanying enforcement procedures \nare not consistent with [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521(a)].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)\n(1)(A)\u2013(C). In other words, the federal regulations continue \nto act as the floor for emissions regulations, but California \ncan seek to enact its own more stringent regulatory \nprogram above those federal requirements.\nSections 209(a) and (b) of the Clean Air Act together \nmake up a statutory compromise between several \ncompeting interests. When Congress enacted the Clean \nAir Act in 1967, California suffered from significant air \nquality and pollution problems caused by motor vehicle \nemissions, which federal emissions regulations were \nunlikely to adequately address. See S. Rep. No. 90-403, \nat 33\u201334 (1967); H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 21\u201323, 96\u201397 \n\n7a\n(1967). California was also the only state with its own \nmotor vehicle emissions standards, and its leadership in \nautomobile emissions regulation had been valuable to the \nfederal government in crafting the Clean Air Act. See \nS. Rep. No. 90-403, at 33\u201334; H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at \n21\u201323, 96\u201397. At the same time, automobile manufacturers \nwere growing concerned that other states might begin \nregulating automobile emissions, subjecting them to a \npatchwork of regulatory obligations and significantly \nincreasing manufacturing costs. See H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 21; see also Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079, 319 U.S. App. D.C. 12 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \nCongress enacted Sections 209(a) and (b) to balance the \nfears of automobile manufacturers, California\u2019s need for \nbespoke regulation, and the federal interest in allowing \nCalifornia to test new emissions regulations. Section \n209(a) addresses the fears of automakers and ensures \nnational uniformity in automobile emissions standards \nby preempting state regulation. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(a). \nMeanwhile, Section 209(b) grandfathers in California\u2019s \nregulatory program and allows it to continue innovating \nnew solutions to automobile pollution. See id. \u00a7\u00a07543(b); \nsee also Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 88 F.3d at 1080.\nB.\nThe D.C. Circuit is familiar with interpreting the \nClean Air Act. Shortly following the enactment of Section \n209(b), the D.C. Circuit addressed the question of how \nCalifornia should determine that its regulations are more \nprotective than the federal regulations. See Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1095. California sought to impose \n\n8a\nregulations on oxides of nitrogen that were significantly \nmore stringent than their federal counterparts. Id. at \n1110 n.32. However, due to technological constraints, \nemissions control devices could not be constructed to \nmeet both California\u2019s oxides of nitrogen standard and \na carbon monoxide standard as stringent as the federal \nstandard. Id. In an effort to impose its high oxides of \nnitrogen standard, California proposed a carbon monoxide \nstandard that was less stringent than the federal carbon \nmonoxide standard. Id. The EPA allowed California\u2019s \nstringent oxides of nitrogen standard to make up for \nits less stringent carbon monoxide standard, as long as \nits regulatory program as a whole was more protective \nthan the federal regulations. Id. Dissatisfied with this \ndecision, opponents of California\u2019s regulations argued \nthat Section 209(b) required California to show that \nits carbon monoxide standard was individually more \nprotective than the federal carbon monoxide standard. In \n1977, Congress resolved this dispute by amending Section \n209(b). The new language of Section 209(b) made explicit \nthat California need only determine that its standards are, \n\u201cin the aggregate, at least as protective of public health \nand welfare\u201d as the federal standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)\n(1). So long as California has made that determination, \nthe EPA must grant California a waiver unless the EPA \nfinds that any of the waiver denial criteria are met. See \nid. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C). The amendment ensures that \nCalifornia is not required to determine that each new \nproposed regulation is more protective than its federal \ncounterpart. Id. It was intended to give California the \n\u201cbroadest discretion in selecting the best means to protect \n\n9a\nthe health of its citizens and the public welfare.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 95-294, at 301\u201302 (1977).3\nAfter Congress amended Section 209(b) to provide \nthat California need only determine that its standards \nwere, \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d at least as protective as the \nfederal standards, the EPA decided to apply a similar \napproach to its analysis of whether California\u2019s proposed \nstandards met any of the waiver denial criteria. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C). Thus, in examining whether \nany of the waiver denial criteria applied, the EPA \nconsidered only whether California\u2019s proposed standards, \nin the aggregate, met any of the criteria\u2014not whether \neach individual standard could be denied under any of \nthe criteria. The EPA continued to evaluate California\u2019s \nwaiver applications under Section 209(b) using this \naggregate method of evaluation for decades. In the fifty-\nfive years since Section 209(b) was originally enacted, \nthe EPA has granted California seventy-five waivers \nusing the aggregate method of evaluation. See California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of a \nPrevious Withdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; Notice \nof Decision, 87 Fed. Reg. 14337 (Mar. 14, 2022) (\u201c2022 \nWaiver Reinstatement Decision\u201d); see also EPA, Vehicle \n3.\u2002 The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments also empowered \nother states to choose between adopting the federal standards or \nthe California standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07507. As of the date of this \nopinion, seventeen states have chosen to adopt some portion of \nthe California regulations. See Cal. Air Res. Bd., States that Have \nAdopted California\u2019s Vehicle Regulations, https://perma.cc/HCS4-\nX7NP (last visited Mar. 27, 2024).\n\n10a\nEmissions California Waivers and Authorizations, \nhttps://perma.cc/5T7U-L8GE (last visited Mar. 27, 2024).\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, California\u2019s emissions \nstandards focused on ozone-generating pollutants, like \nnitrogen oxides, but over time, California expanded \nits regulatory program to restrict a variety of other \nemissions, such as methane and other greenhouse gases. \nSee, e.g., California State Motor Vehicle Pollution \nControl Standards; Waiver of Federal Preemption, 43 \nFed. Reg. 25729, 25735 (June 14, 1978); California State \nMotor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Waiver of \nFederal Preemption Notice of Decision, 49 Fed. Reg. \n18887, 18890 (May 3, 1984). In 1993, the EPA approved \na waiver of California\u2019s first ZEV standard, which \nrequired an annually increasing percentage of vehicles \nsold in California to produce zero tailpipe emissions. \nSee California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control \nStandards; Waiver of Federal Preemption; Decision, 58 \nFed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993).\nC.\nIn recent decades, California has continued to face \nsignificant pollution and climate challenges. It contains \nseven of the ten worst areas for ozone pollution in the \ncountry and six of the ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter. See 2022 Waiver Reinstatement Decision, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 14377 n.469. It also faces \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d Id. at \n14363; see also id. at 14338\u201339 & nn.37, 43. And these \nconditions are exacerbated by climate change. Id. at \n\n11a\n14350 & n.165. Moreover, pollution and climate change \nhave particularly harmful impacts on California due to its \nlarge agriculture and ocean-based economies, dependence \non an over-stressed water supply, long coastlines, and \nsusceptibility to wildfires. See California State Motor \nVehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of Decision \nGranting a Waiver of Clean Air Act Preemption for \nCalifornia\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model Year Greenhouse \nGas Emission Standards for New Motor Vehicles, 74 Fed. \nReg. 32744, 32746 (July 8, 2009).\nTo combat these challenges, in 2005, California \napplied for a waiver for a new set of regulations limiting \ngreenhouse gas emissions. See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-\nEmission Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Program, https://\nperma.cc/VC85-GQ2S (last visited Mar. 27, 2024). The \nrequest sparked disagreement among several subsequent \npresidential administrations. Under President George \nW. Bush\u2019s Administration, the EPA initially denied the \nwaiver on the basis that the standards were not addressing \n\u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nNotice of Decision Denying a Waiver of Clean Air Act \nPreemption for California\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model \nYear Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for New Motor \nVehicles, 73 Fed. Reg. 12156, 12159\u201363 (Mar. 6, 2008). One \nyear later, under the Obama Administration, the EPA \ndetermined that its initial decision to deny the waiver \nhad been based on an incorrect interpretation of Section \n209(b), and ultimately granted the waiver. California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nNotice of Decision Granting a Waiver of Clean Air Act \nPreemption for California\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model \n\n12a\nYear Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for New Motor \nVehicles, 74 Fed. Reg. 32744, 32745\u201346 (July 8, 2009).\nIn 2012, California applied for the waiver at issue in \nthis case, seeking to promulgate a new set of regulations \ncalled the Advanced Clean Car Program. See California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of \nDecision Granting a Waiver of Clean Air Act Preemption \nfor California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car Program and a \nWithin the Scope Confirmation for California\u2019s Zero \nEmission Vehicle Amendments for 2017 and Earlier \nModel Years, 78 Fed. Reg. 2112 (Jan. 9, 2013). The new \nregulations included a Low Emission Vehicle (\u201cLEV\u201d) \nProgram, which set emissions requirements for new cars \nin Model Years 2017 to 2025 with the goal of reducing \ncarbon dioxide emissions by thirty-four percent, and a \nZEV Program, which required around fifteen percent of \nmanufacturers\u2019 fleets to be electric cars by Model Year \n2025. Id. The EPA initially granted the waiver in 2013. \nId. In response, automobile manufacturers in California \nbegan making investments to meet both programs\u2019 \nrequirements. See, e.g., Industry Resp.-Intervenor Br. \n2\u20134.\nIn 2018, after car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram, the EPA changed its course. It issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking to withdraw the portions of the 2013 \nwaiver covering California\u2019s LEV and ZEV standards. \nSee The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles \nRule for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light \nTrucks, 83 Fed. Reg. 42986 (Aug. 24, 2018).\n\n13a\nThe EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver on September \n27, 2019. The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) \nVehicles Rule Part One: One National Program, 84 Fed. \nReg. 51310 (Sept. 27, 2019) (\u201c2019 Withdrawal Decision\u201d). \nThe EPA offered three bases for the withdrawal. Id. at \n51328\u201341. First, the 2013 waiver conflicted with a recent \ndetermination by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) that state greenhouse gas \nregulations were preempted by a provision of the EPCA \nthat prohibits states from enacting their own fuel economy \nstandards. Id. at 51337\u201338; see also 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a032902(a), \n(f) (empowering the NHTSA to set federal fuel economy \nstandards); id. \u00a7\u00a032919(a) (preempting state fuel economy \nstandards). Second, the EPA had decided that it would \nno longer follow a \u201cwhole program\u201d interpretation of \nSection 209(b), and instead would evaluate whether each \nindividual California standard met the requirement that \nit be necessary to \u201cmeet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d 2019 Withdrawal Decision, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n51341 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)). Third, California \ncould not show that its LEV and ZEV regulations were \nnecessary to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nbecause California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse gas emissions and California\u2019s \nair pollution problems. Id. According to the EPA, because \ngreenhouse gas pollution from global sources is blended \nin the atmosphere, the consequences of climate change \nfrom which California suffered were not \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary.\u201d Id. at 51333\u201334.\nFollowing recission of the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers such as Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, \n\n14a\nand Volkswagen entered into independent agreements \nwith California to continue reducing emissions. See \nRevised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Standards, 86 Fed. Reg. \n74434, 74458 (Dec. 30, 2021). Under these agreements, \nthe automakers would continue to meet the LEV \nand ZEV standards in the California regulations. Id. \nAutomakers were motivated to sign these agreements by \nthe investments they had already made in updating their \nfleets and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. \nSee J.A. 155\u201357.\nIn 2021, under the Biden Administration, the EPA \nrevisited its 2019 withdrawal of the 2013 waiver. California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of \na Previous Withdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; \nOpportunity for Public Hearing and Public Comment, \n86 Fed. Reg. 22421 (Apr. 28, 2021). On March 14, 2022, the \nEPA reinstated its 2013 waiver for California\u2019s Advanced \nClean Car Program. 2022 Waiver Reinstatement Decision, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 14332. As a result of that reinstatement, \nCalifornia\u2019s LEV and ZEV standards for Model Years \n2017 through 2025 came back into force. Id. at 14333. \nThe EPA provided three explanations for its 2022 Waiver \nReinstatement Decision: the EPA exceeded its inherent \nauthority to revisit its 2013 decision; it improperly \nrejected the \u201cwhole program\u201d approach; and it improperly \nconsidered the NHTSA\u2019s view of the EPCA, which was \nbeyond the scope of Section 209(b). Id. at 14333\u201335.\n\n15a\nD.\nOn May 12, 2022, State Petitioners filed a petition \nfor review in this Court challenging the EPA\u2019s decision \nto reinstate the 2013 waiver (22-1081). That same day, \nthree groups of Fuel Petitioners filed petitions for \nreview of the same EPA action (22-1083, 22-1084, and \n22-1085). The Court consolidated these cases (22-1081). \nCalifornia and several other states and cities (collectively, \n\u201cCalifornia\u201d),4 environmental organizations, 5 and \nautomobile manufacturers6 have intervened in support \nof respondents in the consolidated case.\n4.\u2002 The state and city intervenors are the City of Los Angeles, \nthe City of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the District \nof Columbia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, \nIllinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, \nand Washington.\n5.\u2002 The environmental organization intervenors are the Center \nfor Biological Diversity, the Clean Air Council, the Conservation Law \nFoundation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Environmental \nLaw and Policy Center, the National Parks Conservation Association, \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, the Public Citizen, the \nSierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n6.\u2002 The automobile manufacturer intervenors are Ford Motor \nCompany, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., BMW of North \nAmerica, LLC, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Volvo Car USA \nLLC, the National Coalition for Advanced Transportation, Advanced \nEnergy Economy, Calpine Corporation, National Grid USA, the New \nYork Power Authority, and the Power Companies Climate Coalition.\n\n16a\nIn their petition, Fuel Petitioners argue that the 2022 \ndecision was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the \nEPA\u2019s authority under Section 209(b) because climate \nchange is not a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condition,\u201d \nand California does not \u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d \nits climate conditions. See, e.g., Fuel Pet. Br. 10\u201311. In \nchallenging the EPA\u2019s determination of California\u2019s \n\u201cneed,\u201d Fuel Petitioners argue that the EPA\u2019s aggregate \napproach is wrong. Id. Meanwhile, State Petitioners \nclaim that by granting a waiver to California, but not to \nany other state, the EPA has violated State Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional right to equal sovereignty. See State Pet. \nBr. 28\u201333. State Petitioners also claim that the waiver \nis contrary to the preemption of state fuel economy \nstandards set out in the EPCA. See State Pet. Br. 33\u201341.\nWe hold that neither Fuel Petitioners as to their \nstatutory claims nor State Petitioners as to their EPCA \nclaims establish standing to bring suit, and thus we do \nnot reach the merits of their claims. We reject State \nPetitioners\u2019 constitutional claim on the merits.\nII.\nA.\nWe begin with the question whether either State or \nFuel Petitioners have standing based on their assertions \nthat the waiver will cause them economic injury. Fuel \nPetitioners premise their standing as to the entirety of \ntheir petition for review on their claimed economic injury. \nState Petitioners, meanwhile, premise their standing for \n\n17a\ntheir claim that the waiver is preempted by the EPCA on \ntheir alleged economic injury.\nA \u201cshowing of standing is \u2018an essential and unchanging\u2019 \npredicate to any exercise of our jurisdiction.\u201d Fla. \nAudubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663, 320 U.S. App. \nD.C. 324 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (quoting Lujan v.

United \nStates, 570 F.3d 316, 324, 386 U.S. App. D.C. 406 (D.C. \nCir. 2009). The \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of \nstanding contains three elements.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact\u2014\nan \u201cinvasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) \nconcrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Bennett v.

Third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 \nas opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n561 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. \n26, 38, 43, 96 S.\u00a0Ct. 1917, 48 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 450 (1976)).\n\u201cA petitioner bears the burden of establishing each\u201d \nof the elements of standing. Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. \nEPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 193 (D.C. \nCir. 2011). To meet that burden, a petitioner must \u201cshow \n\n18a\na \u2018substantial probability\u2019 that it has been injured, that \nthe defendant caused its injury, and that the court could \nredress that injury.\u201d Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, \n899, 352 U.S. App. D.C. 191 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting API v. \nUnited States EPA, 216 F.3d 50, 63, 342 U.S. App. D.C. 159 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000)). And a petitioner may not wait to attempt \nto meet its burden of demonstrating standing until after \nthe respondent contests the issue. Rather, absent \u201cgood \ncause shown,\u201d a petitioner whose standing is not readily \napparent must show that it has standing in \u201cits opening \nbrief.\u201d Id. at 900\u201301. A petitioner may carry this \u201cburden \nof production by citing any record evidence relevant to its \nclaim of standing and, if necessary, appending to its filing \nadditional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to support \nits claim.\u201d Id.; see also D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).\nWhether a petitioner has standing to challenge a \nparticular government action depends, in part, upon \nwhether the petitioner is \u201can object of the action\u201d at \nissue. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. When a petitioner is an \nobject of the action it seeks to challenge, causation and \nredressability are usually easy to demonstrate. Id. But \nwhen, as here, the petitioner \u201cis not [it]self the object of \nthe government action or inaction he challenges, standing \nis not precluded, but is ordinarily \u2018substantially more \ndifficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d Id. at 562 (quoting Allen v. Wright, \n468 U.S. 737, 758, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 3315, 82 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 556 (1984)). \nBecause any injury to petitioners \u201chinges on actions taken \nby manufacturers, the petitioners carry \u2018the burden of \nadduc[ing] facts showing that those [third-party] choices \nhave been or will be made in such manner as to produce \ncausation and permit redressability of injury.\u2019\u201d Chamber \n\n19a\nof Com., 642 F.3d at 201 (alterations in original) (quoting \nCtr. for Biological Diversity v. United States DOI, 563 \nF.3d 466, 477, 385 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).\nAs we will explain, these principles compel the \nconclusion that both State and Fuel Petitioners lack \nstanding premised on their claimed economic injuries \nbecause neither group of Petitioners has met their burden \nof demonstrating that those injuries are redressable.\nB.\nFuel Petitioners argue that, by requiring vehicle \nmanufacturers to sell vehicles that use less or no liquid \nfuel, California\u2019s LEV and ZEV requirements depress \nthe demand for liquid fuels.7 Fuel Petitioners and their \nmembers, who produce and sell liquid fuels and the \nraw materials used to produce those fuels, are thereby \nfinancially injured by the reduction in demand for those \nproducts. Fuel Pet. Br. 16; Fuel Pet. Reply Br. 3\u20134. In \nsupport of Fuel Petitioners\u2019 contention that they are \neconomically injured by the waiver, Fuel Petitioners \noffer over a dozen declarations by individuals who are \naffiliated with Fuel Petitioner entities and organizations; \nthe individuals explain that the entity or organization is \n7.\u2002 Fuel Petitioners include both associations and individual \nentities. Fuel Pet. Br. 16. Because, as we explain, we conclude that \nall Fuel Petitioners have failed to establish redressability, we need \nnot address whether any of the Fuel Petitioner associations have \nestablished organizational standing. Cf. Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at \n898 (laying out the requirements for establishing organizational \nstanding).\n\n20a\ninvolved with producing or selling fuel and that the waiver \ncauses Fuel Petitioners economic injury by reducing the \ndemand for fuel and related products.\nState Petitioners, meanwhile, allege three financial \ninjuries that they contend are caused by the waiver. \nFirst, the waiver causes manufacturers to increase the \ncost of conventional vehicles elsewhere in the country in \norder to account for the cost of meeting the requirements \nimposed on manufacturers by the waiver granted to \nCalifornia. State Petitioners explain that because they \npurchase conventional vehicles, the increase in the prices \nfor those vehicles that results from the waiver causes \nState Petitioners financial harm. State Pet. Br. 14\u201315. \nSecond, State Petitioners contend that the greater shift \nto electric vehicles that results from the waiver will \ncause State Petitioners to generate less fuel-tax revenue. \nId. Finally, State Petitioners argue that the increase \nin electric vehicles caused by the waiver will affect the \nStates\u2019 electrical grids. In support of their standing \nclaims, State Petitioners offer a declaration from each \nindividual State Petitioner and a declaration from an \neconomist, Benjamin Zycher, Ph.D. Each State Petitioner\u2019s \ndeclaration states that the state purchases conventional \n(that is, gas-or diesel-powered) vehicles. State Pet. \nAdd. 6\u201336. In his declaration, Dr. Zycher contends that \nCalifornia\u2019s ZEV requirement will have several economic \nimpacts on State Petitioners, including an increase in the \ncost of conventional vehicles nationwide, a \u201cdecline in the \nquality of delivered state services,\u201d a reduction in \u201cfuel \ntax revenues available for the provision of highway and \n\n21a\nroad services,\u201d and an \u201cincrease in the costs and prices of \ndelivering electric power services.\u201d State Pet. Add. 38\u201339.\nThe EPA and California both dispute that State \nand Fuel Petitioners\u2019 allegations and evidence establish \ninjury and causation sufficient to support standing. EPA \nBr. 23\u201328 (arguing State Petitioners fail to demonstrate \nstanding); California Br. 9\u201315 (arguing both State and Fuel \nPetitioners fail to demonstrate standing). For example, \nas to causation, California argues that both groups of \nPetitioners fail to demonstrate that their alleged injuries \nare caused by the 2022 waiver reinstatement, rather than \nthe original 2013 waiver or rising consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles more generally. California Br. 11, 14. But \nthis Court need not definitively decide whether either \nset of Petitioners has established injury or causation. \nHowever robust their claims of injury and causation \nare, State and Fuel Petitioners spend considerably less \ntime explaining how those injuries are redressable. \nIndeed, even assuming that both sets of Petitioners have \nestablished injury and causation sufficient for standing, \nPetitioners\u2019 standing arguments fail for the same reason: \nBoth groups of Petitioners fall far short of meeting their \nburden of demonstrating a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that \ntheir alleged injuries would be redressed by a favorable \ndecision by this Court. Am. Petroleum, 216 F.3d at 63; see \nalso Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 899\u2013900.\nFuel Petitioners assert in their opening brief\u2014\nwithout explanation or citation\u2014that this Court could \nredress their injuries \u201cby setting aside the action.\u201d Fuel \nPet. Br. 16. Fuel Petitioners\u2019 declarations offer little \n\n22a\nmore; to the extent that Fuel Petitioners\u2019 declarations \ndiscuss redressability at all, the declarations state that \nthe injuries discussed therein \u201cwould be substantially \nameliorated if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d State \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief is similarly conclusory regarding \nredressability. State Petitioners assert that their \u201cinjuries \nare redressable because a judgment setting aside the \nwaiver would eliminate the source of their injuries.\u201d State \nPet. Br. 16. However, none of the declarations submitted \nby State Petitioners with their opening brief addresses \nredressability at all.\nThe difficulty for Fuel and State Petitioners is \nthat their claimed injuries \u201chinge[] on\u201d the actions of \nthird parties\u2014the automobile manufacturers who are \nsubject to the waiver. Chamber of Com., 642 F.3d at \n201. Redressability, too, \u201chinge[s] on the response of\u201d \nthose same automobile manufacturers. Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 562. Both groups of Petitioners\u2019 injuries would be \nredressed only if automobile manufacturers responded \nto vacatur of the waiver by producing and selling fewer \nnon-conventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014and \nmore conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\nAnd, aside from turning on the actions of the automobile \nmanufacturers subject to the waiver, redressability is \nfurther complicated by the relatively short duration of \nthe waiver that Petitioners challenge. These petitions \nfor review concern only the EPA\u2019s decision, in March \n2022, to reinstate the waiver it had previously granted \nCalifornia as to Model Years 2017 through 2025. See 2022 \n\n23a\nWaiver Reinstatement Decision, 87 Fed. Reg. 14337. Thus, \nto meet their burden of demonstrating redressability, \nboth sets of Petitioners must demonstrate a \u201csubstantial \nprobability\u201d not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision by this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do so \nrelatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025. Am. Petroleum, \n216 F.3d at 63.\nThe record evidence provides no basis for us to \nconclude that manufacturers would, in fact, change course \nwith respect to the relevant model years if this Court were \nto vacate the waiver. To begin, Petitioners fail to point to \nany evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vacatur of \nthe waiver would be substantially likely to result in any \nchange to automobile manufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by \nModel Year 2025. The only evidence points in the opposite \ndirection, indicating that automobile manufacturers need \nyears of lead time to make changes to their future model \nyear fleets. In a comment submitted to the EPA during the \nrulemaking process regarding the EPA\u2019s 2019 recission \nof the 2013 waiver, for example, Ford Motor Company \nstated that its product cycle requires several years of \nlead time for planning, and that its \u201cregulatory lead time \n(i.e., awareness of future regulatory requirements)\u201d is \nseven years. J.A. 637. Ford explained that, as a result, \nif the regulatory landscape shifted in some way, \u201clittle \nor nothing could be done to re-optimize the company\u2019s \nproduct plans, which are largely fixed for the next few \nyears.\u201d Id. Further, the record indicates that other \nautomobile manufacturers would also require years \n\n24a\nof lead time to alter their product plans. In comments \nsubmitted to the EPA during the EPA\u2019s rulemaking \nprocess regarding the 2022 waiver reinstatement, Tesla, \nInc. and Toyota Motor North America, Inc., explained \nthat their vehicle product cycles, too, can also begin years \nbefore a vehicle is launched. J.A. 371, 477; see also J.A. \n370 n.5 (summarizing similar statements from Chrysler \nGroup LLC, Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc., \nand Mitsubishi Motors North America). Thus, even \nif automobile manufacturers were inclined to change \ncourse so as to alleviate the Petitioners\u2019 injuries within \nthe given model years, it is far from clear that they could \ndo so within the model years covered by the waiver.8 To \nbe sure, it is possible that manufacturers could change \ntheir prices without modifying their production cycles, \nwhich may redress Petitioners\u2019 injuries because pricing \ncould affect the mix of conventional and electric vehicles \npurchased. But Petitioners point us to no evidence that \nmanufacturers would change their prices by Model Year \n2025 either.\nDespite the paucity of evidence in the record \nregarding the redressability of their injuries, neither \ngroup of Petitioners attempts to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u201ccit[e] any \nrecord evidence\u201d or to file \u201cadditional affidavits or other \n8.\u2002 We also note that several automobile manufacturers have \nintervened in support of the EPA in this case. Those manufacturers \nexplain in their brief in support of the EPA that \u201cboth internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u201d are prompting \nmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, irrespective \nof California\u2019s regulations. Industry Resp.-Intervenor Br. 6\u20137.\n\n25a\nevidence sufficient to support\u201d redressability. Sierra Club, \n292 F.3d at 900\u201301. Nor, for that matter, does either set \nof Petitioners grapple with the relatively short nature of \nthe waiver they challenge. Rather, all Petitioners seem to \nhave treated redressability as a foregone conclusion. See \nCrete Carrier Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 490, 494, 361 U.S. \nApp. D.C. 54 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (petitioners lacked standing \nwhere they failed to produce \u201cactual evidence\u201d regarding \nhow the regulated parties \u201cwould respond\u201d to vacatur); \nBranton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 912, 301 U.S. App. D.C. 244 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (\u201cA court is rightly reluctant to enter a \njudgment which may have no real consequence, depending \nupon the putative cost-benefit analyses of third parties \nover whom it has no jurisdiction and about whom it has \nalmost no information.\u201d).\nWhen asked about redressability at oral argument, \ncounsel for Fuel Petitioners emphasized that \nredressability\u2014as with each prong of standing\u2014is \nassessed when a lawsuit is first filed. Oral Argument \nTranscript 74; see also Del Monte, 570 F.3d at 325 (\u201c[S]\ntanding is assessed as of the time a suit commences.\u201d). True \nenough. But that does not help Fuel Petitioners: Even \u201cas \nof the time\u201d this lawsuit commenced, Fuel Petitioners had \nfailed to point to any evidence in the record showing that \ntheir alleged injuries were redressable. Del Monte, 570 \nF.3d at 325. Put differently, the flaw in Fuel Petitioners\u2019 \nstanding arguments is not\u2014as counsel for Fuel Petitioners \ncontended at oral argument, Oral Argument Transcript \n74\u201375\u2014that their standing arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed, but that their claims have been \nmooted by the passage of time. Fuel Petitioners\u2019 standing \narguments were deficient from the start.\n\n26a\nState Petitioners, meanwhile, argue that, to the \nextent that there is any doubt that they have met their \nburden of demonstrating causation and redressability, this \nCourt should resolve it in their favor given the \u201cspecial \nsolicitude\u201d to which states are entitled when they seek to \nprotect their \u201cquasi-sovereign interests.\u201d Massachusetts \nv. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518\u201320, 127 S.\u00a0Ct. 1438, 167 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d \n248 (2007); see also State Pet. Br. 16. We disagree. The \n\u201cspecial solicitude\u201d afforded to states can relax standing \nrequirements only so far. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \nEven the \u201cgreater leeway\u201d afforded to states seeking to \nprotect quasi-sovereign interests cannot save defective \nstanding claims when, as here, the record is \u201calmost \ncompletely silent\u201d with respect to an element of a state\u2019s \nstanding. Alaska v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 17 F.4th 1224, \n1230, 454 U.S. App. D.C. 493 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\nState and Fuel Petitioners\u2019 sparse treatment of \nredressability is particularly surprising because, in a \nprevious case, this Court noted that it could not presume \nredressability in essentially the same circumstances. \nIn Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA, \nthe Chamber of Commerce and the National Automobile \nDealers Association, on behalf of their automobile dealer \nmembers, petitioned for review in this Court of the EPA\u2019s \ndecision to grant California a waiver, under Section 209(b), \nwith respect to automobile Model Years 2009 through 2016. \n642 F.3d at 196\u201397. There, the petitioners\u2014automobile \ndealers who, like the Petitioners in this case, were not \ndirectly subject to the waiver\u2014explained that automobile \nmanufacturers\u2019 responses to the waiver injured them in \ntwo ways. First, automobile manufacturers would respond \n\n27a\nto the waiver by altering the mix of vehicles they sold in \nCalifornia and other states; as a result, vehicle dealers \nwould be injured because they would be unable to obtain \nspecific vehicles that their customers wanted to buy. Id. at \n201. And second, the California standards would increase \nautomobile manufacturers\u2019 costs and, in turn, increase \nthe prices of the automobiles they manufactured. Id. The \nautomobile dealers believed they would be injured by those \nincreased vehicle costs because they would have to choose \nwhether to keep their prices the same, and accordingly \nlower their profit margins, or to increase their prices \nto account for the increased vehicle costs, at the risk of \nturning away customers. Id.\nThe Chamber of Commerce Court ultimately resolved \npetitioners\u2019 claims on mootness grounds, not standing. \nId. at 204, 206. But before reaching that conclusion, the \nCourt expressed serious doubts that the petitioners \nhad met their burden of demonstrating redressability. \nId. at 205. The record before the Court indicated that \nvacatur of the challenged waiver may not result in any \nchange on the part of automobile manufacturers. And, \nthe Court noted, \u201cPetitioners ha[d] offered no evidence \nto the contrary, and no evidence that, if the waiver were \nvacated, [automobile manufacturers] would proceed on \na different course more favorable to the petitioners.\u201d Id. \nat 205\u201306. So even if petitioners\u2019 claims were not moot, \ntheir failure to introduce redressability evidence made \nit\u2014at a minimum\u2014rather unclear whether their claims \nwere redressable.\nAs the EPA and intervenors correctly recognize, \nState and Fuel Petitioners\u2019 standing submissions run into \n\n28a\nprecisely the same problem here. In its response brief, \nthe EPA explains in some detail how State Petitioners \nhave failed to substantiate the redressability of their \ninjuries. EPA Br. 26. California, meanwhile, argues that \nneither group of Petitioners has provided any evidence \nthat vacatur would remedy their injuries. California \nBr. 13. Further underlining the point, California offers \nan expert declaration by Joshua M. Cunningham, \nthe Chief of the Advanced Clean Cars Branch of the \nCalifornia Air Resources Board, who explains in \nspecific terms why the Petitioners\u2019 claims are unlikely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision by this Court. \nCalifornia Add. 84\u201385; 96\u201399. Cunningham explains that \nautomobile manufacturers have already made a number \nof public commitments regarding both vehicle pricing \nand availability with respect to the remaining model \nyears covered by the challenged waiver; those public \ncommitments would tend to suggest that neither group \nof Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable. As Cunningham \nputs it, \u201cmanufacturers have likely already made pricing \ndecisions for\u201d the remaining model years. California \nAdd. 96.

And Fuel Petitioners should have been aware \nthat redressability may pose a particularly challenging \nobstacle here, considering the relatively narrow \n\n32a\ntimeframe of the particular waiver Petitioners challenge \nand the evidence in the record showing that automobile \nmanufacturers generally require years of lead time to \nmake changes to their future model year fleets.

Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 899.\nSecond, even if Fuel Petitioners reasonably believed \nthat their standing was \u201cself-evident\u201d when they filed their \nopening brief, Petitioners offer no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief after \nCalifornia raised the issue in its opposition brief. Twin \nRivers, 934 F.3d at 614. In this respect, Fuel Petitioners\u2019 \nmotion relies on a false premise: Oral argument was \nplainly not the first time that California argued that \nFuel Petitioners had failed to demonstrate redressability. \nRather, as we have explained, California explicitly argued \nthat Fuel Petitioners had offered no evidence regarding \nthe redressability of their injuries, and California \nprovided the Court with a declaration that addressed \nthe point. Having failed even to attempt to respond to \nCalifornia\u2019s arguments regarding redressability at the \nreply stage, Fuel Petitioners provide this Court with no \nreason to allow them to do so now.\nIII.\nState Petitioners also argue that the EPA\u2019s 2022 \ndecision is \u201ccontrary to constitutional right\u201d under 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0706(2)(B) because Section 209(b) of the Clean Air \n\n33a\nAct is unconstitutional. They rely on the equal sovereignty \nprinciple, which the Supreme Court applied in Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 133 S.\u00a0 Ct. 2612, 186 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 651 (2013), to hold that Fifteenth Amendment \nlegislation that disparately impacts states\u2019 control over \nvoting procedures must be \u201csufficiently related to the \nproblem it targets.\u201d Id. at 542 (quoting Nw.

State Petitioners argue \nthat this principle also categorically prohibits Congress \nfrom using its Commerce Clause power in a way that \nwithdraws sovereign authority from some states but not \nothers. And Section 209(b), they say, violates that principle \nby preempting the authority of every state but California \nto regulate motor vehicle emissions. We conclude that \nState Petitioners have standing to raise this constitutional \nclaim, but we join the two other circuits to have considered \nthe issue in rejecting State Petitioners\u2019 request to extend \nthe equal sovereignty principle in this fashion. See NCAA \nv. Governor of New Jersey, 730 F.3d 208, 239 (3d Cir. 2013), \nabrogated on other grounds by Murphy v.

Cir. \n2003). Assuming State Petitioners\u2019 constitutional theory \nis correct, Section 209(b) and the EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \n\n34a\nviolate their constitutionally protected interest in equal \nsovereignty by leaving them with less regulatory authority \nover vehicle emissions than California. This claimed \ninjury is akin to the type of dignitary injury recognized \nin equal protection cases. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. \n728, 739\u201340, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 1387, 79 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 646 (1984). And, \nState Petitioners argue, invalidating the decision would \nredress that injury and restore their sovereign equality \nby removing California\u2019s greater authority.\nRespondents resist that analysis on the ground that \nState Petitioners do not ask this court to increase their \nown sovereign authority over motor vehicle emissions. \nThe States instead seek to reduce California\u2019s authority.\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held, however, that \nthis type of \u201cleveling down\u201d remedy is sufficient to support \nstanding when a party asserts a constitutional right to \nequality. As the Court has put it, \u201cwhen the \u2018right invoked \nis that to equal treatment,\u2019 the appropriate remedy \nis a mandate of equal treatment, a result that can be \naccomplished by withdrawal of benefits from the favored \nclass as well as by extension of benefits to the excluded \nclass.\u201d Heckler, 465 U.S. at 740 (quoting Iowa-Des Moines \nNat\u2019l Bank v.

But Respondents \nhave not identified\u2014and we do not perceive\u2014any material \nreason to treat the right to equal sovereignty claimed here \n\n35a\nany differently for standing purposes.11 And under the \nlogic of the Equal Protection cases, holding Section 209(b) \nunconstitutional and vacating the waiver would redress the \nclaimed constitutional injury by leaving all states equally \npositioned, in that none could regulate vehicle emissions. \nAccordingly, unlike with their asserted economic injuries, \nState Petitioners\u2019 asserted constitutional injury can be \nredressed even absent evidence that manufacturers will \nchange their plans before the waiver expires.12\n11.\u2002 Although we find State Petitioners\u2019 claimed dignitary \nharm sufficiently analogous in kind for purposes of standing, we do \nnot suggest that this harm is commensurate with equal protection \ninjuries based on the perpetuation of \u201carchaic and stereotypic \nnotions\u201d and stigmatization of members \u201cof [a] disfavored group as \n\u2018innately inferior.\u2019\u201d Heckler, 465 U.S. at 739 (quoting Miss.

We are aware of \nno precedent or rationale that would allow parties to bring claims \nover which we otherwise would lack jurisdiction\u2014such as State \nPetitioners\u2019 statutory preemption claim\u2014by appending another \nclaim subject to a different standing analysis.\n\n36a\nB.\nTurning to the merits, we reject State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory. The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution \ncontains a \u201cfundamental principle of equal sovereignty.\u201d \nShelby County, 570 U.S. at 544. But neither the Supreme \nCourt nor any other court has ever applied that principle as \na limit on the Commerce Clause or other Article I powers. \nAs explained below, the rationale of Shelby County and the \ncases on which it relied in fact suggests that the principle \nimposes no such limit. The parties\u2019 remaining arguments \nconfirm that conclusion. We therefore hold that Section \n209(b) is subject to traditional rational basis review for \nCommerce Clause legislation and\u2014as no one disputes\u2014\nthat it is constitutional under that standard.\nShelby County addressed the constitutionality of the \nVoting Rights Act\u2019s (\u201cVRA\u201d) coverage formula, which \nrequired some but not all states to obtain approval from \nfederal authorities before enacting voting-related laws, a \nprocess known as preclearance.

Katzenbach, 383 U.S. \n301, 86 S.\u00a0Ct. 803, 15 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 769 (1966), which held that \nthe coverage formula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was \nconstitutional because it was \u201crational in both practice \nand theory.\u201d Shelby County, 570 U.S. at 550 (quoting \nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. at 330); see also id. at 550\u201351 \n(discussing the exceptional circumstances that supported \nKatzenbach\u2019s conclusion).

Indeed, in discussing \n\n40a\nthe Constitution\u2019s assignment to Congress of control over \ninterstate commerce the Court has stressed that \u201c[n]o other \nfederal power was so universally assumed to be necessary\u201d \nand \u201cno other state power was so readily relinquished.\u201d \nH.

Accordingly, no one \nquestions that Congress could readily preempt all states \nfrom regulating motor vehicle emissions, or that Congress \nitself could set different vehicle emissions standards for \ndifferent regions of the country.

Shelby County does not support requiring a \nheightened justification for disparate intrusions into \nareas over which the Constitution grants Congress such \ncomprehensive control.

Recall that Shelby County did not establish \na categorical bar against Congress leaving states \nwith different levels of sovereign authority even in the \ntraditionally state-dominated context of voting; it required \nonly that Congress show the disparate treatment is \n\n41a\n\u201csufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d 570 \nU.S. at 550\u201351 (quoting Nw.

Those cases involved congressional attempts to \nplace limits on new states as a condition of admission \nto the Union and identified \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d as an \n\u201cattribute .\u00a0.\u00a0. guaranteed to\u201d each state \u201cupon admission.\u201d \nUnited States v. Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 16, 80 S.\u00a0Ct. \n961, 4 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 1025 (1960), supplemented sub nom. \nUnited States v. Louisiana, 382 U.S. 288, 86 S.\u00a0Ct. 419, \n15 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 331 (1965). For example, Coyle v. Smith, 221 \nU.S. 559, 31 S.\u00a0Ct. 688, 55 L.\u00a0Ed. 853 (1911), held that \nCongress had no authority to prohibit Oklahoma from \nmoving its state capital as a condition of admission into \nthe United States. Id. at 567\u201368. The Court\u2019s opinion \naddressed whether Congress\u2019s power to admit new \nstates into the Union allowed such a condition, which was \nconcededly beyond any of Congress\u2019s other enumerated \npowers. Id. The Court explained that Congress could not \nuse its admission power to require a new state to give up \n\n42a\nan aspect of sovereignty that the thirteen original states \nretained. Id. To do so, the Court concluded, would create \na \u201cunion of states unequal in power, as including states \nwhose powers were restricted only by the Constitution, \nwith others whose powers had been further restricted by \nan act of Congress accepted as a condition of admission.\u201d \nId. at 567. State Petitioners here seize on that and similar \nlanguage to support their argument that the equal \nsovereignty principle must mean Congress generally has \nno power to legislate in ways that leave the states with \nunequal sovereign authority.\nThe equal footing cases, however, do not directly \napply either outside of the admission context or to Article \nI powers like the Commerce Clause. Shelby County \nitself reaffirmed prior holdings that the doctrine is not \na \u201cbar on differential treatment outside th[e] context\u201d of \nstates\u2019 admission into the Union. 570 U.S. at 544. Shelby \nCounty, of course, drew on the equal footing cases and \nconcluded that the principle of equal sovereignty they \ndiscuss remained \u201chighly pertinent\u201d in the context of that \ncase. Id. But for all the reasons explained above, Shelby \nCounty does not extend the principle even further to any \n(let alone all) Article I legislation.\nThe equal footing cases themselves also support that \nconclusion. Those cases contemplated\u2014though, to be \nsure, only in dicta\u2014that even if Congress treated states \ndifferently at the time of admission, it would not violate \nthe equal footing guarantee so long as it acted within the \nscope of its plenary powers over interstate commerce. \nThe Court suggested in Coyle that Congress could treat \nstates differently if\u2014instead of using its admission \n\n43a\npower\u2014it enacted \u201clegislation intended as a regulation \nof commerce,\u201d because to do that would be acting \u201cwithin \nthe sphere of the plain power of Congress.\u201d 221 U.S. at \n574; see also id. at 572\u201374; Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212, \n229\u201330, 11 L.\u00a0Ed. 565 (1845). Such a condition would not \nput states on an impermissibly unequal footing because it \n\u201cwould not operate to restrict the state\u2019s legislative power \nin respect of any matter which was not plainly within the \nregulating power of Congress.\u201d Coyle, 221 U.S. at 574. \nAccordingly, the equal footing cases fit neatly with the \nconclusion that the equal sovereignty principle is not a \ncategorical bar on Congress deploying its plenary power \nover interstate commerce in ways that differentially affect \nstates\u2019 legislative power.\nThe parties also debate whether State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory is supported by the Constitution\u2019s text, founding \nera history, and law of nations principles. We address \neach in turn and conclude these other indicators of \nconstitutional meaning do not support State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory.\nThe Constitution does not contain any textual provision \nsuggesting an equal sovereignty limit on Congress\u2019s \nArticle I powers generally or on the Commerce Clause in \nparticular. As already discussed, the Commerce Clause \nis a plenary grant of authority to regulate interstate \ncommerce which the Supreme Court has held is subject \nonly to those limitations \u201cprescribed in the constitution\u201d \nand \u201cexpressed in plain terms.\u201d Gibbons, 22 U.S. at 196.\nTo the extent the Constitution\u2019s text sheds light on \nthe question, it appears to cut against State Petitioners, \n\n44a\nbecause the Constitution does impose certain equality-\nbased limitations on other Article I powers. For example, \nthe text of Article I, Section 8 states that laws concerning \nbankruptcy, naturalization, and duties shall be \u201cuniform.\u201d \nSee U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1, cl. 4. Similarly, Article \nI, Section 9 prohibits \u201c[p]reference .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . given by any \nRegulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one \nState over those of another.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a09, cl. 6. \nState Petitioners argue that these textual provisions do \nnot suggest the absence of a general equal sovereignty \nlimit on Article I. As they point out, these provisions speak \nonly to whether Congress can treat states differently \nwhen Congress itself does the legislating, not whether \nCongress can allow some but not other states to exercise \nthe sovereign authority to legislate on an issue. That is, the \nprovisions guarantee the states equal treatment for only \nspecific subjects rather than equal sovereignty for only \nthose subjects. The key for present purposes, however, \nis that even though the Founders plainly knew how to \ninclude equality-based protections for states in Article I \nwhen they wished to, they did not include any mention of \nState Petitioners\u2019 broad equal sovereignty principle. The \nfact that some constitutional clauses explicitly contain an \nequality-based guarantee therefore supports a negative \ninference\u2014though perhaps only a mild one\u2014that the \nCommerce Clause is not so constrained.\nThere are, of course, \u201cconstitutional doctrines \nthat are not spelled out in the Constitution but are \nnevertheless implicit in its structure and supported by \nhistorical practice,\u201d such as the doctrine of state sovereign \nimmunity. Franchise Tax Bd. v. Hyatt, 139 S.\u00a0Ct. 1485, \n\n45a\n1498\u201399, 203 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 768 (2019). That category also \nincludes limits on the Commerce Clause, such as the Tenth \nAmendment anticommandeering doctrine, which are \nsupported by the historical context in which our federal \nstructure was created. See New York v. United States, \n505 U.S. 144, 163\u201366, 112 S.\u00a0Ct. 2408, 120 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 120 \n(1992) (discussing founding era debates supporting the \nanticommandeering doctrine). The evidence the parties \nprovide from the founding era, however, does not show \nthat State Petitioners\u2019 version of the equal sovereignty \nprinciple has a comparable historical pedigree. It is true, \nas State Petitioners urge, that the general subject of state \nsovereignty and the states\u2019 relation to each other and the \nnew federal government was a core focus at the founding. \nDespite that focus, however, State Petitioners have \nidentified no evidence that the Founders contemplated the \ntype of inviolable equal state sovereignty State Petitioners \nask us to announce.\nThe equal sovereignty debate at the founding centered \non how states would be represented in Congress, with the \nsmaller states arguing for equal representation for each \nstate and the larger states seeking \u201cequality for each \nvoter\u201d in the form of proportional representation. See \nWesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 11-14, 84 S.\u00a0Ct. 526, 11 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 481 (1964) (summarizing the Great Compromise \ndebates); Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson \n(Oct. 24, 1787), in 12 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson \n270, 279 (Julian P. Boyd ed., 1955) (discussing how the \n\u201clittle States insisted on retaining their equality in both \nbranches\u201d while the \u201clarge states .\u00a0.\u00a0. urged that as the \nnew Government was to be drawn principally from the \n\n46a\npeople immediately\u201d). For example, New Jersey delegate \nWilliam Paterson used the concept of \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d \nto support his argument for a single legislative chamber \nwith an equal vote for each state. Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 11 \n(citing 3 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, \nat 251 (Max Farrand ed., 1911)). Eventually, these debates \nled to the Great Compromise, which established two forms \nof equality central to Article I: \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d in \nthe Senate in the form of equal representation for each \nstate and equal representation for each voter in the \nHouse in the form of proportional representation. U.S. \nConst. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02, 3; see also The Federalist No. 39, at \n255 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). The \nFounders\u2019 preoccupation with the manner and extent of \nstate equality under the Constitution also appears to have \nyielded the specific equality-based limits on Congress\u2019s \nlegislative authority discussed above. If the Constitution \nalso contained State Petitioners\u2019 fundamental yet unstated \nlimit on Congress\u2019s authority to legislate, one would expect \nample historical evidence of that limit at the founding. \nState Petitioners point us to none. Cf. New York, 505 U.S. \nat 163\u201366.\nIn fact, as State Petitioners admit, the Constitution \nincludes one provision that expressly allows Congress to \nenhance the sovereign authority of some states without \ngranting that authority equally to all states. State Pet. \nReply Br. 10. Article I, Section 10 provides that \u201cNo State \nshall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of \nTonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, \nenter into any Agreement or Compact with another \nState, or with a foreign Power.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a010, \n\n47a\ncl. 3. That is, Congress has the power to grant individual \nstates greater authority to, for example, assess taxes and \neven enter compacts with foreign powers\u2014indisputably \nelements of \u201csovereignty\u201d\u2014without extending the same \nauthority to other states. See Wheeling, P. & C. Transp. \nCo. v. City of Wheeling, 99 U.S. 273, 283, 25 L.\u00a0Ed. 412 \n(1878) (\u201cTaxation, beyond all doubt, is the exercise of a \nsovereign power.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.S. 433, \n440, 101 S.\u00a0Ct. 703, 66 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 641 (1981) (compacts \nnecessarily \u201ctend[] to the increase of political power\u201d \nfor the states (quoting U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax \nComm\u2019n, 434 U.S. 452, 468, 98 S.\u00a0Ct. 799, 54 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d \n682 (1978))). Early Congresses used Article I, Section 10 \nin this very manner, granting specific states legislative \nauthority to impose tonnage duties. See, e.g., Act of Feb. \n9, 1791, ch. 5, 1 Stat. 190 (consenting to Maryland statute \nimposing duty at Port of Baltimore); Act of Aug. 11, 1790, \nch. 43, 1 Stat. 184 (consenting to Georgia, Maryland, and \nRhode Island statutes imposing tonnage duties). If this \nprovision were\u2014as State Petitioners would have it\u2014a \nlimited exception to an otherwise generally applicable \nequal sovereignty guarantee implicit in the Constitution, \nwe would expect to see some founding era discussion \nof how the provision interacts with that broader equal \nsovereignty principle. Yet State Petitioners identify no \nevidence of that either.\nThe only affirmative support State Petitioners identify \nfor their theory comes from law of nations principles. \nThey argue that the Founders expected international \nlaw of nations principles to govern the states and that \nthose principles included a notion of equal sovereignty \n\n48a\nthat would render federal legislation unconstitutional if \nit treated states differently. State. Pet. Br. 18; State Pet. \nReply Br. 12 (\u201cAt the founding, the law of nations entitled \nall sovereigns to perfect equality.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). That argument is unpersuasive. \nInternational law contained no analog for the relation in \nour constitutional system between the federal government \nand the states, and so it would be surprising if the law of \nnations dictated limits on Congress\u2019s authority in relation \nto the states. And, as it turns out, the Supreme Court has \neffectively explained that the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy \nClause defeats State Petitioners\u2019 reasoning. In Gibbons, \nthe Court held that while states may have equal sovereign \nauthority to regulate commerce in the absence of federal \naction, that authority is \u201csubjected .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the superior \npower of Congress\u201d when Congress acts. 22 U.S. at 70. \nIndeed, the Gibbons Court cited the very same law of \nnations principles that State Petitioners rely on, but only \nto describe the relationship between the states when \nCongress has not acted pursuant to its commerce power. \nId. at 69\u201370. No case since Gibbons has said otherwise.\nThe nature and extent of equality between the states \nhas been a central debate throughout our country\u2019s \nhistory, from the founding to the admission of new \nstates and beyond. But State Petitioners point us to \nno meaningful support for their novel request to apply \nthe equal sovereignty principle as a categorical limit on \nCongress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce. The \nFirst and Third Circuits\u2014the only appellate courts to \nhave considered similar arguments\u2014have found Shelby \nCounty\u2019s discussion of the equal sovereignty principle \ninapplicable to Commerce Clause and Spending Clause \nlegislation for similar reasons. See NCAA, 730 F.3d at \n\n49a\n238\u201339 (Commerce Clause); Mayhew, 772 F.3d at 95 \n(Spending Clause).\nSection 209(b) is subject to the rational basis review \nnormally applied to Commerce Clause legislation. See \nHodel, 452 U.S. at 276\u201377. And because State Petitioners \npresent no argument that Section 209(b) or the waiver \nat issue cannot survive that review, we reject their \nconstitutional challenge.\nState Petitioners\u2019 request to set aside the \nAdministrator\u2019s decision on these grounds is denied.\nSo ordered. \n\n50a\nAPPENDIX B\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n[EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257; FRL-9325-01-OAR]\nCalifornia State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control \nStandards; Advanced Clean Car Program; \nReconsideration of a Previous Withdrawal of a \nWaiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision\nAGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency.\nACTION: Notice of decision.\nSUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) has completed the reconsideration of its 2019 \naction withdrawing a 2013 Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver \nof preemption for California\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemission standards and zero emission vehicle (ZEV) \nsale mandate, which are part of California\u2019s Advanced \nClean Car (ACC) program.

In addition, EPA is withdrawing \nthe interpretive view of CAA section 177 included in its \n2019 action, that States may not adopt California\u2019s GHG \nstandards pursuant to section 177 even if EPA has granted \nCalifornia a waiver for such standards.

Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n55a\nI.\t Executive Summary\nCAA section 209(a) generally preempts states from \nadopting emission control standards for new motor \nvehicles. But Congress created an important exception \nfrom preemption. Under CAA section 209(b), the State \nof California1 may seek a waiver of preemption, and EPA \nmust grant it unless the Agency makes one of three \nstatutory findings. California\u2019s waiver of preemption \nfor its motor vehicle emissions standards allows other \nStates to adopt and enforce identical standards pursuant \nto CAA section 177. Since the CAA was enacted, EPA \nhas granted California dozens of waivers of preemption, \npermitting California to enforce its own motor vehicle \nemission standards. \nOf particular relevance to this action, in 2013, EPA \ngranted California\u2019s waiver request for the state\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Car (ACC) program (ACC program \nwaiver).2 California\u2019s ACC program includes both a \nLow Emission Vehicle (LEV) program, which regulates \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nas well as a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate. \nThese two requirements are designed to control smog- and \nsoot-causing pollutants and GHG emissions in a single \n1.\u2002  The CAA section 209(b) waiver is limited \u201cto any State \nwhich has adopted standards . . . for the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March 30, \n1966,\u201d and California is the only State that had standards in place \nbefore that date. \u201cCalifornia\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Air Resources Board\u201d \n(CARB) are used interchangeably in certain instances in this notice \nwhen referring to the waiver process under section 209(b). \n2.\u2002  78 FR 2111 (January 9, 2013). \n\n56a\ncoordinated package of requirements for passenger cars, \nlight-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles \n(as well as limited requirements related to heavy-duty \nvehicles). Between 2013 and 2019, twelve other States \nadopted one or both of California\u2019s standards as their own. \nBut in 2019, EPA partially withdrew this waiver as part of \na final action entitled \u201cThe Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient \n(SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program\u201d \n(SAFE 1), marking the first time the agency withdrew \na previously granted waiver.3 In addition, in the context \nof SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive view of CAA \nsection 177 asserting that other states were precluded \nfrom adopting California\u2019s GHG standards. \nAs Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA), I am now rescinding EPA\u2019s 2019 actions in \nSAFE 1 that partially withdrew the ACC program waiver \nfor California\u2019s ACC program. I am rescinding these \nactions because (1) EPA\u2019s reconsideration of the waiver \nunder the particular facts and circumstances of this case \nwas improper; (2) EPA\u2019s reconsideration was based on a \nflawed interpretation of CAA section 209(b); (3) even under \nthat flawed interpretation, EPA misapplied the facts and \ninappropriately withdrew the waiver; (4) EPA erred in \nlooking beyond the statutory factors in CAA 209(b) to \naction taken by another agency under another statute to \njustify withdrawing the waiver; (5) that agency has also \nsince withdrawn the action EPA relied on in any event; \nand (6) EPA inappropriately provided an interpretive view \nof section 177.\n3.\u2002  84 FR 51310 (September 27, 2019). \n\n57a\nAs a result of this action, EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver for the \nACC program, specifically the waiver for California\u2019s GHG \nemission standards and ZEV sales mandate requirements \nfor model years (MYs) 2017 through 2025, comes back \ninto force.4 I am also rescinding the interpretive view set \nforth in SAFE 1 that States may not adopt California\u2019s \nGHG standards pursuant to CAA section 177 even if \nEPA has granted California a section 209 waiver for \nsuch standards. Accordingly, States may now adopt and \nenforce California\u2019s GHG standards so long as they meet \nthe requirements of Section 177, and EPA will evaluate \nany State\u2019s request to include those provisions in a SIP \nthrough a separate notice and comment process. \nSection II of this action contains a detailed history \nof EPA\u2019s waiver adjudications leading up to this action. \nIn summary, in 2012, CARB submitted the ACC waiver \nrequest to EPA, which included ample evidence of the \ncriteria pollution benefits of the GHG standards and the \nZEV sales mandate. As it had in all prior waiver decisions \nwith two exceptions (including SAFE 1), in considering the \nrequest EPA relied on its \u201ctraditional\u201d interpretation of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B), which examines whether California \n4.\u2002  In SAFE 1, EPA did not withdraw the entire 2013 waiver, but \ninstead only withdrew the waiver as it related to California\u2019s GHG \nemission standards and the ZEV sales mandate. The waiver for the \nlow-emission vehicle (LEV III) criteria pollutant standards in the \nACC program remained in place. EPA\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE \n1 and the impact on the ACC waiver therefore relates only to the \nGHG emission standards and the ZEV sales mandate, although \u201cACC \nprogram waiver\u201d is used in this document. This action rescinds the \nwaiver withdrawal in SAFE 1. In this decision, the Agency takes no \nposition on any impacts this decision may have on state law matters \nregarding implementation. \n\n58a\nneeds a separate motor vehicle program as a whole\u2014not \nspecific standards\u2014to address the state\u2019s compelling \nand extraordinary conditions. In 2013, EPA granted \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request for its ACC program in full. \nIn 2018, however, EPA proposed to withdraw portions of \nits waiver granted in 2013 based on a new interpretation \nof section 209(b)(1)(B) that looked at whether the specific \nstandards (the GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate), as \nopposed to the program as a whole, continued to meet the \nsecond and third waiver prongs (found in sections 209(b)\n(1)(B) and (C)).5 In addition, EPA proposed to look beyond \nthe section 209(b) criteria to consider the promulgation of \na NHTSA regulation and pronouncements in SAFE 1 that \ndeclared state GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandates preempted under EPCA. In 2019, after granting \nCARB a waiver for its ACC program in 2013 and after 12 \nstates had adopted all or part of the California standards \nunder section 177, EPA withdrew portions of the waiver \nfor CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandates. In SAFE 1, EPA cited changed circumstances \nand was based on a new interpretation of the CAA and \nthe agency\u2019s reliance on an action by NHTSA that has \nnow been repealed.6 \n5.\u2002  EPA\u2019s 2018 proposal was jointly issued with the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 83 FR 42986 \n(August 24, 2018) (the \u201cSAFE proposal\u201d). In addition to partially \nwithdrawing the waiver, that proposal proposed to set less stringent \ngreenhouse gas and CAFE standards for model years 2021-2026. \nNHTSA also proposed to make findings related to preemption under \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and its relationship \nto state and local GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandates. \n6.\u2002  84 FR 51310. In SAFE 1, NHTSA also finalized its action \nrelated to preemption under EPCA.

On April 28, 2021, EPA announced its Notice \nof Reconsideration, including a public hearing and an \nopportunity for public comment.7 The Agency stated \nits belief that there were significant issues regarding \nwhether SAFE 1 was a valid and appropriate exercise \nof Agency authority, including the amount of time that \nhad passed since EPA\u2019s ACC program waiver decision, \nthe approach and legal interpretations used in SAFE 1, \nwhether EPA took proper account of the environmental \nconditions ( e.g., local climate and topography, number \nof motor vehicles, and local and regional air quality) in \nCalifornia, and the environmental consequences from \nthe waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1. Further, EPA stated \nit would be addressing issues raised in the related \npetitions for reconsideration of EPA\u2019s SAFE 1 action. \nIn the meantime, having reconsidered its own action, \nand also in response to Executive Order 13990, NHTSA \nrepealed its conclusion that state and local laws related \nregulatory text and well as pronouncements within the preamble \nof SAFE 1. In 2020, EPA finalized its amended and less stringent \ncarbon dioxide standards for the 2021-2026 model years in an action \ntitled \u201cThe Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for \nModel Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks\u201d (SAFE \n2). 85 FR 24174 (April 30, 2020). \n7.\u2002  \u201cCalifornia State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of a Previous \nWithdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; Opportunity for Public \nHearing and Public Comment.\u201d 86 FR 22421 (April 28, 2021). \n\n60a\nto fuel economy standards, including GHG standards and \nZEV sales mandates, were preempted under EPCA,8 and \nEPA revised and made more stringent the Federal GHG \nemission standards for light-duty vehicles for 2023 and \nlater model years, under section 202(a).9 \nSection III of this action outlines the principles that \ngovern waiver reconsiderations. It sets forth the statutory \nbackground and context for the CAA preemption of \nnew motor vehicle emission standards, the criteria for \ngranting a waiver of preemption, and the ability of other \nStates to adopt and enforce California\u2019s new motor vehicle \nemission standards where a waiver has been issued if \ncertain CAA criteria are met. In brief, CAA section 209(a) \ngenerally preempts all States or political subdivisions \nfrom adopting and enforcing any standard relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor \nvehicle engines. But section 209(b) contains an important \nexception that allows only California to submit a request \nto waive preemption for its standards. Importantly, \nEPA must grant the waiver unless the Administrator \nmakes at least one of three findings: (1) That California\u2019s \ndetermination that its standards will be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective of public health and welfare as \napplicable Federal standards, is arbitrary and capricious \n(the \u201cfirst waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(A)); \n(2) that California does not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions (the \n\u201csecond waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(B)); or (3) \n8.\u2002  86 FR 74236 (December 29, 2021). \n9.\u2002  86 FR 74434 (December 30, 2021). \n\n61a\nthat California standards are not consistent with section \n202(a), which contains EPA\u2019s authority to regulate motor \nvehicles (the \u201cthird waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)\n(C)). In the 1977 amendments to the CAA, section 177 was \nadded to allow other States that may be facing their own \nair quality concerns to adopt and enforce the California \nnew motor vehicle emission standards for which California \nhas been granted a waiver under section 209(b) if certain \ncriteria are met. \nSection III also provides more context to indicate that \nCongress intended that, when reviewing a request for a \nwaiver, EPA treat with deference the policy judgments on \nwhich California\u2019s vehicle emission standards are based. \nIt discusses the history of Congress allowing states to \nadopt more stringent standards. Ultimately, Congress \nbuilt a structure in section 209(b) that grants California \nauthority to address its air quality problems, and also \nacknowledges the needs of other states to address their \nair quality problems through section 177. Lastly, Section \nIII describes the burden and standard of proof for waiver \ndecisions.\nSection IV of this action then discusses EPA\u2019s first \nbasis for rescinding the SAFE 1 waiver withdrawal: That \nEPA did not appropriately exercise its limited authority \nto withdraw a waiver once granted. Section 209 does not \nprovide EPA with express authority to reconsider and \nwithdraw a waiver previously granted to California. EPA\u2019s \nauthority thus stems from its inherent reconsideration \nauthority. In the context of reconsidering a waiver grant, \nthat authority may only be exercised sparingly. EPA \n\n62a\nbelieves its inherent authority to reconsider a waiver \ndecision is constrained by the three waiver criteria that \nmust be considered before granting or denying a waiver \nrequest under section 209(b). EPA\u2019s reconsideration \nmay not be broader than the limits Congress placed on \nits ability to deny a waiver in the first place. EPA notes \nfurther support for limiting its exercise of reconsideration \nauthority, relevant in the context of a waiver withdrawal, \nis evidenced by Congress\u2019s creation of a state and federal \nregulatory framework to drive motor vehicle emissions \nreduction and technology innovation that depends for \nits success on the stable market signal of the waiver \ngrant\u2014automobile manufacturers must be able to depend \nreliably on the continuing validity of the waiver grant \nin order to justify the necessary investments in cleaner \nvehicle technology. Accordingly, EPA now believes it may \nonly reconsider a previously granted waiver to address a \nclerical or factual error or mistake, or where information \nshows that factual circumstances or conditions related to \nthe waiver criteria evaluated when the waiver was granted \nhave changed so significantly that the propriety of the \nwaiver grant is called into doubt. Even then, as with other \nadjudicatory actions, when choosing to undertake such a \nreconsideration EPA believes it should exercise its limited \nauthority within a reasonable timeframe and be mindful \nof reliance interests. EPA expects such occurrences will \nbe rare. The Agency\u2019s waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1 was \nnot an appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s limited authority; \nthere was no clerical error or factual error in the ACC \nprogram waiver, and SAFE 1 did not point to any factual \ncircumstances or conditions related to the three waiver \nprongs that have changed so significantly that the \n\n63a\npropriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Rather, \nthe 2019 waiver withdrawal was based on a change in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation, an incomplete assessment \nof the record, and another agency\u2019s action beyond the \nconfines of section 209(b). EPA erred in reconsidering a \npreviously granted waiver on these bases. Accordingly, \nEPA is rescinding its 2019 withdrawal of its 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver.\nSections V and VI further explain why, even if SAFE \n1 were an appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s limited authority \nto reconsider its previously-granted waiver, the Agency \nwould still now rescind its waiver withdrawal.\nAs discussed in Section V, the Agency\u2019s reinterpretation \nof the second waiver prong in SAFE 1 was flawed. While \nEPA has traditionally interpreted the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), to require a waiver unless \nthe Agency demonstrates that California does not \nneed its own motor vehicle emissions program, to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, the SAFE 1 \nwaiver withdrawal decision was based on a statutory \ninterpretation that calls for an examination of the need \nfor the specific standard at issue. Section V explains why \nEPA believes that its traditional interpretation is, at \nleast, the better interpretation of the second waiver prong \nbecause it is most consistent with the statutory language \nand supported by the legislative history. Accordingly, we \nreaffirm the traditional interpretation\u2014in which EPA \nreviews the need for California\u2019s motor vehicle program\u2014\nin this action.\n\n64a\nAdditionally, Section V explains why even if the \nfocus is on the specific standards, when looking at the \nrecord before it, EPA erred in SAFE 1 in concluding \nthat California does not have a compelling need for the \nspecific standards at issue\u2014the GHG emission standards \nand ZEV sales mandate. In particular, in SAFE 1, the \nAgency failed to take proper account of the nature and \nmagnitude of California\u2019s serious air quality problems, \nincluding the interrelationship between criteria and GHG \npollution.10 Section V further discusses EPA\u2019s improper \nsubstitution in SAFE 1 of its own policy preferences for \nCalifornia\u2019s, and discusses the importance of deferring to \nCalifornia\u2019s judgment on \u201cambiguous and controversial \nmatters of public policy\u201d that relate to the health and \nwelfare of its citizens.11 Based on a complete review of the \nrecord in this action, EPA now believes that, even under \nthe SAFE 1 interpretation, California needs the ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG standards at issue to address \ncompelling and extraordinary air quality conditions in \n10.\u2002  As explained herein, the requirements in the ACC program \nwere designed to work together in terms of the technologies that \nwould be used to both lower criteria emissions and GHG emissions. \nThe standards, including the ZEV sales mandate and the GHG \nemission standards, were designed to address the short- and long-\nterm air quality goals in California in terms of the criteria emission \nreductions (including upstream reductions) along GHG emission \nreductions. The air quality issues and pollutants addressed in the \nACC program are interconnected in terms of the impacts of climate \nchange on such local air quality concerns such as ozone exacerbation \nand climate effects on wildfires that affect local air quality. \n11.\u2002  40 FR 23102, 23104 (May 28, 1975); 58 FR 4166 (January \n13, 1993). \n\n65a\nthe state. EPA\u2019s findings in SAFE 1, which were based on \nthe Agency\u2019s inaccurate belief that these standards were \neither not intended to or did not result in criteria emission \nreductions to address California\u2019s National Ambient Air \nQuality Standard (NAAQS) obligations, are withdrawn. \nSection VI discusses SAFE 1\u2019s other basis for \nwithdrawing the ACC program waiver, EPCA. In SAFE \n1, EPA reached beyond the waiver criteria in section \n209(b)(1) and considered NHTSA\u2019s regulations in SAFE \n1 that state or local regulation of carbon dioxide emission \nfrom new motor vehicles (including California\u2019s ZEV sales \nmandate and GHG standards) are related to fuel economy \nand as such are preempted under EPCA. NHTSA has \nsince issued a final rule that repeals all regulatory text \nand additional pronouncements regarding preemption \nunder EPCA set forth in SAFE 1.12 This action by NHTSA \neffectively removes the underpinning and any possible \nreasoned basis for EPA\u2019s withdrawal decision based on \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1. Additionally, the \nAgency has historically refrained from consideration of \nfactors beyond the scope of the waiver criteria in section \n209(b)(1) and the 2013 ACC program waiver decision was \nundertaken consistent with this practice. EPA believes \nthat the consideration of EPCA preemption in SAFE 1 \nled the Agency to improperly withdraw the ACC program \nwaiver on this non-CAA basis. EPA\u2019s explanation that \nwithdrawal on this basis was justified because SAFE 1 \nwas a joint action, and its announcement that this would \nbe a single occurrence, does not justify the ACC waiver \n12\u2002  86 FR 74236. \n\n66a\nwithdrawal. Thus, EPA is rescinding the withdrawal of \nthose aspects of the ACC program waiver that were based \non NHTSA\u2019s actions in SAFE 1. \nSection VII addresses SAFE 1\u2019s interpretive view of \nsection 177 that States adopting California\u2019s new motor \nvehicle emission standards could not adopt California\u2019s \nGHG standards.13 EPA believes it was both unnecessary \nand inappropriate in a waiver proceeding to provide \nan interpretive view of the authority of states to adopt \nCalifornia standards when section 177 does not assign \nEPA any approval role in states\u2019 adoption of the standards. \nTherefore, as more fully explained in Section VII, the \nAgency is rescinding the interpretive view on section \n177 set out in SAFE 1. Section VIII discusses certain \nother considerations, including the equal sovereignty \ndoctrine and California\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision, \nand concludes that they do not disturb EPA\u2019s decision to \nrescind the 2019 waiver withdrawal action. \nSection IX contains the final decision to rescind \nthe withdrawal of the 2013 ACC program waiver. In \nsummary, I find that although EPA has inherent authority \nto reconsider its prior waiver decisions, that authority to \nreconsider is limited and may be exercised only when EPA \nhas made a clerical or factual error or mistake, or where \ninformation shows that factual circumstances or conditions \nrelated to the waiver criteria evaluated when the waiver \nwas granted have changed so significantly that the \npropriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Further, \n13.\u2002  84 FR at 51310, 51350. \n\n67a\nEPA\u2019s reconsideration may not be broader than the limits \nCongress placed on its ability to deny a waiver in the first \nplace. Even where those conditions are met, I believe that \nany waiver withdrawal decision should consider other \nfactors such as the length of time since the initial decision \nand California and others\u2019 reliance on the initial decision. \nBecause there were no factual or clerical errors or such \nsignificantly changed factual circumstances or conditions \nnecessary to trigger EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider its \npreviously granted waiver during the SAFE 1 proceeding, \nI believe SAFE 1 was not an appropriate exercise of \nEPA\u2019s authority to reconsider. In addition, even if it were \nan appropriate exercise, EPA should not have departed \nfrom its traditional interpretation of the second waiver \nprong (section 209(b)(1)(B)), which is properly focused on \nCalifornia\u2019s need for a separate motor vehicle emission \nprogram\u2014not specific standards\u2014to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions. And even under EPA\u2019s SAFE \n1 interpretation of the second waiver prong, a complete \nreview of the factual record demonstrates that California \ndoes need the GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nin the State. Therefore, EPA should not have withdrawn \nthe ACC program waiver based upon the second waiver \nprong in SAFE 1 and recission of the withdrawal is \nwarranted. Additionally, I find that EPA inappropriately \nrelied on NHTSA\u2019s finding of preemption, now withdrawn, \nto support its waiver withdrawal, and rescind the waiver \nwithdrawal on that basis as well. Finally, independently \nin this action, I am rescinding the interpretive views of \nsection 177 that were set forth in SAFE 1, because it was \ninappropriate to include those views as part of this waiver \nproceeding.\n\n68a\nFor these reasons, I am rescinding EPA\u2019s part of \nSAFE 1 related to the CAA preemption of California\u2019s \nstandards. This recission has the effect of bringing the \nACC program waiver back into force.\nII.\t Background\nThis section provides background information needed \nto understand EPA\u2019s decision process in SAFE 1, and this \ndecision. This context includes: A summary of California\u2019s \nACC program including the record on the criteria pollutant \nbenefits of its ZEV sales mandate and GHG emission \nstandards; a review of the prior GHG emission standards \nwaivers in order to explain EPA\u2019s historical evaluation \nof the second waiver prong; an overview of the SAFE \n1 decision; a review of the petitions for reconsideration \nfiled subsequent to SAFE 1; and a description of the \nbases and scope of EPA\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1. \nEPA\u2019s sole purpose in soliciting public comment on its \nreconsideration was to determine whether SAFE 1 was a \nvalid and appropriate exercise of the Agency\u2019s authority. \nIn the Notice of Reconsideration, EPA therefore noted \nthat reconsideration was limited to SAFE 1 and that \nthe Agency was not reopening the ACC program waiver \ndecision.\nA.\t California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car (ACC) Program \nand EPA\u2019s 2013 Waiver\nOn June 27, 2012, CARB notified EPA of its adoption \nof the ACC program regulatory package that contained \namendments to its LEV III and ZEV sales mandate, and \nrequested a waiver of preemption under section 209(b) to \n\n69a\nenforce regulations pertaining to this program.14 The ACC \nprogram combined the control of smog- and soot-causing \npollutants and GHG emissions into a single coordinated \npackage of requirements for passenger cars, light-duty \ntrucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles (as well as \nlimited requirements related to heavy-duty vehicles for \ncertain model years).15 \nIn its 2012 waiver request, CARB noted that the 2012 \nZEV amendments would also result in additional criteria \npollutant benefits in California in comparison to the \n14.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request, EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0562-0004 (2012 \nWaiver Request) at 1, 3-6. CARB\u2019s LEV III standards include both \nits criteria emission standards and its GHG emission standards. \nSAFE 1 did not address the LEV III criteria emission standards \nand as such the ACC program waiver remained in place. SAFE \n1 did address CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate and this action addresses these two standards as well. \nAs noted in CARB\u2019s 2012 Waiver Request, these three standards \nare interrelated and comprehensive in order to address the State\u2019s \nserious air quality problems including its criteria pollutants and \nclimate change challenges. \n15.\u2002  As noted in CARB\u2019s waiver request, \u201c[a]t the December \n2009 hearing, the Board adopted Resolution 09-66, reaffirming \nits commitment to meeting California\u2019s long term air quality and \nclimate change reduction goals through commercialization of ZEV \ntechnologies. The Board further directed staff to consider shifting \nthe focus of the ZEV regulation to both GHG and criteria pollutant \nemission reductions, commercializing ZEVs and PHEVs in order to \nmeet the 2050 goals, and to take into consideration the new LEV fleet \nstandards and propose revisions to the ZEV regulation accordingly.\u201d \n2012 Waiver Request at 2 (emphasis added). EPA stated in SAFE \n1 that California\u2019s ZEV standard initially targeted only criteria \npollutants. 84 FR at 51329. See also 78 FR at 2118. \n\n70a\nearlier ZEV regulations and would likely provide benefits \nbeyond those achieved by complying with the LEV III \ncriteria pollutant standard for conventional vehicles only. \nCARB attributed these benefits not to vehicle emissions \nreductions specifically, but to increased electricity and \nhydrogen use that would be more than offset by decreased \ngasoline production and refinery emissions.16 CARB\u2019s \nwaiver request attributed the criteria emissions benefits \nto its LEV III criteria pollutant fleet standard and did \nnot include similar benefits from its ZEV sales mandate. \nAccording to the request, the fleet would become cleaner \nregardless of the ZEV sales mandate because the ZEV \nsales mandate is a way to comply with the LEV III \nstandards and, regardless of the ZEV sales mandate, \nmanufacturers might adjust their compliance response \nto the standard by making less polluting conventional \nvehicles. CARB further explained that because upstream \ncriteria and PM emissions are not captured in the LEV \nIII criteria pollutant standard, net upstream emissions \nare reduced through the increased use of electricity and \nconcomitant reductions in fuel production.17 \nOn August 31, 2012, EPA issued a notice of opportunity \nfor public hearing and written comment on CARB\u2019s \nrequest and solicited comment on all aspects of a full \nwaiver analysis for such request under the criteria \nof section 209(b).18 Commenters opposing the waiver \n16.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 6. \n17.\u2002  Id. at 15-16. \n18.\u2002  77 FR 53119 (August 31, 2012). \n\n71a\nasked EPA to deny the waiver under the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), as it applied to the GHG \nprovisions in the ACC Program, calling on EPA to \nadopt an alternative interpretation of that provision \nfocusing on California\u2019s need for the specific standards. \nFollowing public notice and comment and based on its \ntraditional interpretation of section 209(b), on January \n9, 2013, EPA granted California\u2019s request for a waiver of \npreemption to enforce the ACC program regulations.19 \nThe traditional interpretation, which EPA stated is the \nbetter interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B), calls for \nevaluating California\u2019s need for a separate motor vehicle \nemission program to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.20 As explained, EPA must grant a waiver to \n19.\u2002  Set forth in the ACC program waiver decision is a summary \ndiscussion of EPA\u2019s earlier decision to depart from its traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) (the second waiver prong) in \nthe 2008 waiver denial for CARB\u2019s initial GHG standards for certain \nearlier model years along with EPA\u2019s return to the traditional \ninterpretation of the second prong in the waiver issued in 2009. 78 \nFR at 2125-31. These interpretations are discussed more fully in \nSection III. \n20.\u2002  Id. at 2128 (\u201cThe better interpretation of the text and \nlegislative history of this provision is that Congress did not intend \nthis criterion to limit California\u2019s discretion to a certain category \nof air pollution problems, to the exclusion of others. In this context \nit is important to note that air pollution problems, including local or \nregional air pollution problems, do not occur in isolation. Ozone and \nPM air pollution, traditionally seen as local or regional air pollution \nproblems, occur in a context that to some extent can involve long \nrange transport of this air pollution or its precursors. This long \nrange or global aspect of ozone and PM can have an impact on local \nor regional levels, as part of the background in which the local or \nregional air pollution problem occurs.\u201d). \n\n72a\nCalifornia unless the Administrator makes at least one of \nthe three statutorily-prescribed findings in section 209(b)\n(1). Concluding that opponents of the waiver did not meet \ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate that California does \nnot have such need, EPA found that it could not deny the \nwaiver under the second waiver prong.21 \nWithout adopting the alternative interpretation, \nEPA noted that, to the extent that it was appropriate to \nexamine the need for CARB\u2019s specific GHG standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, EPA \nhad explained at length in its earlier 2009 GHG waiver \ndecision that California does have compelling and \nextraordinary conditions directly related to regulation \nof GHGs. This conclusion was supported by additional \nevidence submitted by CARB in the ACC program \nwaiver proceeding, including reports that demonstrate \nrecord-setting wildfires, deadly heat waves, destructive \nstorm surges, and loss of winter snowpack. Many of these \nextreme weather events and other conditions have the \npotential to dramatically affect human health and well-\n21.\u2002  Because EPA received comment on this issue during the \nACC program waiver proceeding, as it pertained to both CARB\u2019s \nGHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate, the Agency \nrecounted the interpretive history associated with standards for \nboth GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants to explain EPA\u2019s \nbelief that section 209(b)(1)(B) should be interpreted the same \nway for all air pollutants. Id. at 2125-31 (\u201cAs discussed above, EPA \nbelieves that the better interpretation of the section 209(b)(1)(B) \ncriterion is the traditional approach of evaluating California\u2019s need \nfor a separate motor vehicle emission program to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions. Applying this approach with the \nreasoning noted above, with due deference to California, I cannot \ndeny the waiver.\u201d). \n\n73a\nbeing.22 Similarly, to the extent that it was appropriate to \nexamine the need for CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate, EPA \nnoted that the ZEV sales mandate in the ACC program \nenables California to meet both its air quality and climate \ngoals into the future. EPA recognized that CARB\u2019s \ncoordinated strategies reflected in the ACC program for \naddressing both criteria pollutants and GHGs and the \nmagnitude of the technology and energy transformation \nneeded to meet such goals.23 Therefore, EPA determined \nthat, to the extent the second waiver prong should be \ninterpreted to mean a need for the specific standards at \nissue, CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate satisfy such a finding. \nIn the context of assessing the need for the specific \nZEV sales mandate in the ACC program waiver, EPA \nnoted CARB\u2019s intent in the redesign of the ZEV regulation \n22.\u2002  Id. at 2126-29. Within the 2009 GHG waiver, and again in \nthe 2013 ACC program waiver, EPA explained that the traditional \napproach does not make section 209(b)(1)(B) a nullity, as EPA must \nstill determine whether California does not need its motor vehicle \nprogram to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions as \ndiscussed in the legislative history. Conditions in California may \none day improve such that it may no longer have a need for its motor \nvehicle program. \n23.\u2002  Id. at 2131 (\u201cWhether or not the ZEV standards achieve \nadditional reductions by themselves above and beyond the LEV III \nGHG and criteria pollutant standards, the LEV III program overall \ndoes achieve such reductions, and EPA defers to California\u2019s policy \nchoice of the appropriate technology path to pursue to achieve these \nemissions reductions. The ZEV standards are a reasonable pathway \nto reach the LEV III goals, in the context of California\u2019s longer-\nterm goals.\u201d). \n\n74a\nof addressing both criteria pollutants and GHG emissions, \nand CARB\u2019s demonstration of \u201cthe magnitude of the \ntechnology and energy transformation needed from the \ntransportation sector and associated energy production to \nmeet . . . the goals set forth by California\u2019s climate change \nrequirements\u201d and found that the ZEV standards would \nhelp California achieve those \u201clong term emission benefits \nas well as . . . some [short-term] reduction in criteria \npollutant emissions.\u201d24 \nB.\t Prior Waivers for GHG Standards\nFor over fifty years, EPA has evaluated California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers of preemption under section 209(b), \nprimarily considering CARB\u2019s motor vehicle emission \nprogram for criteria pollutants.25 More recently, the Agency \nhas worked to determine how section 209(b)(1)(B) should \nbe interpreted and applied to GHG standards, including \n24.\u2002  Id. at 2130-31.

Congress directed EPA to implement \nsubsection (e). See 40 CFR part 1074. EPA review of CARB requests \nsubmitted under section 209(e)(2)(A)(ii) includes consideration of \nwhether CARB needs its nonroad vehicle and engine program to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions. See 78 FR 58090 \n(September 20, 2013). \n\n75a\nconsideration of the relationship of GHG standards to \nCalifornia\u2019s historical air quality problems, the public \nhealth impacts of GHG emissions on NAAQS pollutants, \nand the direct impacts of GHG emissions and climate \nchange on California and its inhabitants. While the SAFE \n1 withdrawal and revocation of the waiver for CARB\u2019s \nACC program represents a singular snapshot of this \ntask, it is important to examine EPA\u2019s long-standing and \nconsistent waiver practice in general, including EPA\u2019s \ninterpretations in prior waiver decisions pertaining to \nCARB\u2019s GHG emission standards, in order to determine \nwhether EPA properly applied the waiver criterion in \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) in SAFE 1.26 \nHistorically, EPA has consistently interpreted and \napplied the second waiver prong by considering whether \nCalifornia needed a separate motor vehicle emission \nprogram as compared to the specific standards at issue \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.27 At the \nsame time, in response to commenters that have argued \nthat EPA is required to examine the specific standards \nat issue in the waiver request, EPA\u2019s practice has been to \nnevertheless review the specific standards to determine \nwhether California needs those individual standards to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions.28 This \n26.\u2002  EPA notes that, in the history of EPA waiver decisions, \nit has only denied a waiver once (in 2008) and withdrawn a waiver \nonce (in 2019). Each instance was under this second waiver prong \nin section 209(b)(1)(B). \n27.\u2002  49 FR 18887, 18890 (May 3, 1984). \n28.\u2002   For example, in EPA\u2019s 2009 GHG waiver that reconsidered \nthe 2008 GHG waiver denial, the Agency noted that \u201cGiven the \n\n76a\ndoes not mean that EPA has adopted an \u201calternative \napproach\u201d and required a demonstration for the need for \nspecific standards; rather, this additional Agency review \nhas been afforded to address commenters\u2019 concerns and \nthis secondary analysis has been done to support the \nAgency\u2019s primary assessment. For example, EPA granted \nan authorization for CARB\u2019s In-use Off-road Diesel \nStandards (Fleet Requirements) that included an analysis \nunder both approaches.29 The only two departures from \nthis traditional approach occurred first in 2008 when EPA \ncomments submitted, however, EPA has also considered an \nalternative interpretation, which would evaluate whether the \nprogram or standards has a rational relationship to contributing \nto amelioration of the air pollution problems in California. Even \nunder this approach, EPA\u2019s inquiry would end there. California\u2019s \npolicy judgment that an incremental, directional improvement will \noccur and is worth pursuing is entitled, in EPA\u2019s judgment, to great \ndeference. EPA\u2019s consistent view is that it should give deference to \nCalifornia\u2019s policy judgments, as it has in past waiver decisions, \non California\u2019s choice of mechanism used to address air pollution \nproblems. EPA does not second-guess the wisdom or efficacy of \nCalifornia\u2019s standards. EPA has also considered this approach \nwith respect to the specific GHG standards themselves, as well as \nCalifornia\u2019s motor vehicle emissions program.\u201d 74 FR at 32766 (citing \nto Motor & Equip.

On \nMarch 6, 2008, EPA denied the waiver request based \non a new interpretive finding that section 209(b) was \nintended for California to enforce new motor vehicle \nemission standards that address local or regional air \npollution problems, and an Agency belief that California \ncould not demonstrate a \u201cneed\u201d under section 209(b)\n(1)(B) for standards intended to address global climate \nchange problems. EPA also employed this new alternative \ninterpretation to state a belief that the effects of climate \nchange in California are not compelling and extraordinary \nin comparison with the rest of the country. Therefore, in \nthe 2008 waiver denial, EPA did not evaluate whether \nCalifornia had a need for its motor vehicle emission \nprogram to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \n(the traditional interpretation) but rather focused on \nthe specific GHG emission standard in isolation and not \nin conjunction with the other motor vehicle emission \nstandards for criteria pollutants.\nIn 2009, EPA initiated a reconsideration of the \n2008 waiver denial. The reconsideration resulted in \ngranting CARB a waiver for its GHG emission standards \n\n78a\ncommencing in the 2009 model year.30 In granting \nthe waiver, EPA rejected the Agency\u2019s alternative \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong announced \nin the 2008 waiver denial. Instead, EPA returned to \nits traditional approach of evaluating California\u2019s need \nfor a separate motor vehicle emission program to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because the \nAgency viewed it as the better interpretation of the \nsecond waiver prong. Under the traditional interpretation, \nEPA found that the opponents of the waiver had not met \ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate that California did \nnot need its motor vehicle emission program to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions. In responding \nto comments on this issue, EPA also determined that, \neven if the alternative interpretation were to be applied, \nthe opponents of the waiver had not demonstrated that \nCalifornia did not need its GHG emissions standards to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions.31 \nSince EPA\u2019s 2009 GHG waiver decision and before \nSAFE 1 the Agency applied the traditional interpretation \nof the second waiver prong in its GHG-related waiver \n30.\u2002  74 FR 32743, 32745 (July 8, 2009). \n31.\u2002  74 FR at 32759-67. For example, EPA noted that the \nanalysis of the need for CARB\u2019s GHG standards in the 2008 waiver \ndenial failed to consider that although the factors that cause ozone \nare primarily local in nature and that ozone is a local or regional \nair pollution problem, the impacts of global climate change can \nnevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution problem.

In the first instance, \nin 2009, CARB adopted amendments to its certification \nrequirements that would accept demonstration to the \nFederal GHG standards as compliance with CARB\u2019s \nGHG program. This provision is known as a \u201cdeemed-to-\ncomply\u201d provision.32 In 2011, EPA determined that this \ndeemed-to-comply provision was within-the-scope of the \nwaiver issued in July 2009, relying on the traditional \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong.33 As such, \n32.\u2002  California Code of Regulations, Title 13 1961(a)(1)(B). \nUnder this provision, automakers could comply with the California \nGHG standards for model years 2017-2025 by meeting Federal GHG \nstandards for the same model years. \n33.\u2002  76 FR 34693. EPA\u2019s \u201cwithin-the-scope\u201d decisions are \ngenerally performed when CARB has amended its regulations that \nwere previously waived by EPA under section 209(b)(1) and include an \nanalysis of whether EPA\u2019s prior evaluation of the waiver criteria has \nbeen undermined by CARB\u2019s amendments. EPA received comment \nduring the reconsideration of SAFE 1 that questioned whether \nCARB needed its GHG standards if it was otherwise accepting \ncompliance with the Federal GHG standards. EPA addressed the \nissue in its final decision (76 FR at 34696-98) and continues to believe \nEPA\u2019s analysis applies. The existence of federal emission standards \nthat CARB may choose to harmonize with or deem as compliance \nwith its own State standards (or that CARB may choose to set \nmore stringent standards) does not on its own render California\u2019s \nas not needed. CARB continues to administer an integrated and \ncomprehensive motor vehicle emission program (including its ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG emission standards and other applicable \nemission standards for light-duty vehicles) and this program \ncontinues to evolve to address California\u2019s serious air quality issues. \nCARB\u2019s decision to select some federal emission standards as \n\n80a\nin the June 14, 2011 within-the-scope decision EPA \ndetermined that CARB\u2019s 2009 amendments did not affect \nor undermine the Agency\u2019s prior determination made in \nthe 2009 GHG waiver decision, including the technological \nfeasibility findings in section 209(b)(1)(C).34 EPA also \nacted on two requests for waivers of preemption for \nCARB\u2019s heavy-duty (HD) tractor-trailer GHG emission \nstandards.35 Once again, EPA relied upon its traditional \napproach of evaluating California\u2019s need for a separate \nmotor vehicle emission program to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions and found that no evidence \nhad been submitted to demonstrate that California no \nsufficient to comply with its own State emission standards does not \nnegate the overall design and purpose of section 209 of the CAA. \nIn the within-the-scope decision issued in 2011, EPA agreed with \nGlobal Automakers comment that the deemed-to-comply provision \nrenders emission benefits equally protective as between California \nand Federal programs.

Rather, EPA noted, \nthe relevant question is whether California needs its own motor \nvehicle emission program and not whether there is a need for specific \nstandards.

EPA posited that since the grant of the initial \nwaiver a reassessment of California\u2019s need for its GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate under the second \nwaiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(B), was appropriate. EPA \nfurther posited that its own Federal GHG rulemaking in \nthe SAFE proposal raised questions about the feasibility \nof CARB\u2019s standards under the third waiver prong, section \n209(b)(1)(C).39 In addition, EPA reasoned that the SAFE \nproposal presented a unique situation that required \nEPA to consider the implications of NHTSA\u2019s proposed \nconclusion that California\u2019s GHG emission standards and \nZEV sales mandate were preempted by EPCA.40 EPA \n38.\u2002  The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule \nfor Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, 83 \nFR at 42986. \n39.\u2002  As explained below, EPA did not make a determination \nregarding section 209(b)(1)(C) in SAFE 1. \n40.\u2002  \u201cTo the extent that NHTSA has determined that these \nstandards are void ab initio because EPCA preempts standards that \nrelate to fuel economy, that determination presents an independent \nbasis for EPA to consider the validity of the initial grant of a waiver \n\n83a\nthus also posited that state standards preempted under \nEPCA cannot be afforded a valid section 209(b) waiver \nand then proposed that it would be necessary to withdraw \nthe waiver separate and apart from section 209(b)(1)(B) \nand (C) if NHTSA finalized its interpretation regarding \npreemption under EPCA. \nDuring the SAFE 1 proceeding, EPA received \nadditional information demonstrating that the ZEV \nsales mandate plays a role in reducing criteria pollution, \nincluding CARB\u2019s comments that EPA\u2019s prior findings \nin the ACC program waiver were correct.

In the same action, EPA withdrew the \nwaiver of preemption for California to enforce the ACC \nprogram GHG and ZEV sales mandate on two grounds.45 \nFirst, in SAFE 1 the Agency posited that standards \npreempted under EPCA could not be afforded a valid \nwaiver of preemption under section 209(b).

Additionally, EPA expressed its intention \nnot to consider factors other than statutory criteria set out \nin section 209(b)(1)(A)-(C) in future waiver proceedings, \nexplaining that addressing the preemptive effect of EPCA \nand its implications for EPA\u2019s waiver for California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate was uniquely called for \nin SAFE 1 because EPA and NHTSA were coordinating \nregulatory actions in a single notice.47 \nSecond, EPA withdrew the waiver for the GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate under the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), on two alternative grounds. \nSpecifically, EPA determined first that California does \nnot need the GHG standards \u201cto meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(B), \nand second, even if California does have compelling and \nextraordinary conditions in the context of global climate \nchange, California does not \u201cneed\u201d the specific GHG \nstandards under section 209(b)(1)(B) because they will not \nmeaningfully address global air pollution problems of the \ntype associated with GHG emissions.48 EPA also reasoned \n46.\u2002  84 FR at 51338. \n47.\u2002  Id. \n48.\u2002  Id. at 51341-42. \n\n87a\nthat because CARB had characterized the ZEV sales \nmandate as a compliance mechanism for GHG standards, \nboth were \u201cclosely interrelated\u201d given the overlapping \ncompliance regimes for the ACC program, and as a result \nthe ZEV sales mandate was inextricably interconnected \nwith CARB\u2019s GHG standards.49 In support of its overall \ndetermination that the ZEV sales mandate was not needed \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, EPA \nrelied on a single statement in the ACC program waiver \nsupport document where CARB did not attribute criteria \nemission reductions to the ZEV sales mandate, but rather \nnoted its LEV III criteria pollutant fleet standard was \nresponsible for those emission reductions.50 Relying on \nthis reasoning, EPA also withdrew the waiver for the ZEV \nsales mandate under the second waiver prong finding that \nCalifornia had no \u201cneed\u201d for its own ZEV sales mandate. \nIn withdrawing the waiver, EPA relied on an \nalternative view of the scope of the Agency\u2019s analysis of \nCalifornia waiver requests and posited that reading \u201csuch \nState standards\u201d as requiring EPA to only and always \nconsider California\u2019s entire motor vehicle program would \nlimit the application of this waiver prong in a way that \nEPA did not believe Congress intended.51 EPA further \n49.\u2002  Id. at 51337. \n50.\u2002  Id. at 51330. \n51.\u2002  In other words, EPA asserted that once it determines that \nCalifornia needed its very first set of submitted standards to meet \nextraordinary and compelling conditions, EPA would never have the \ndiscretion to determine that California did not need any subsequent \nstandards for which it sought a successive waiver. EPA based its \n\n88a\nnoted that the Supreme Court had found that CAA \nprovisions may apply differently to GHGs than they do to \ntraditional pollutants in UARG v. EPA, 134 S.

As noted above, the House \nCommittee Report explained as part of the 1977 amendments to the \nClean Air Act that California was to be afforded flexibility to adopt \na complete program of motor vehicle emission controls (emphasis \nadded). As such, EPA believes that Congress intended EPA to afford \nCalifornia the broadest possible discretion in selecting the best \nmeans to protect the health of its citizens and the public welfare.32 \nEPA believes this intent extends to CARB\u2019s flexibility in designing \nits motor vehicle emission program and evaluating the aggregate \neffect of regulations within the program.\u201d 78 FR at 2217. \n54.\u2002  83 FR at 43240. \n55.\u2002  84 FR at 51350. EPA explained that it may make a \ndetermination in connection with a future final action with regard \nto Federal standards. EPA\u2019s subsequent regulation to issue Federal \nstandards did not address this issue. 85 FR 24174. \n\n90a\nprogram waiver was implicit in section 209(b) given that \nrevocation of a waiver is implied in the authority to grant \na waiver. The Agency noted that further support for the \nauthority to reconsider could be found in a single sentence \nin the 1967 legislative history of provisions now codified \nin sections 209(a) and (b) and the judicial principle that \nagencies possess inherent authority to reconsider their \ndecisions. According to the Senate report from the 1967 \nCAA amendments, the Administrator has \u201cthe right . . . \nto withdraw the waiver at any time [if] after notice and \nan opportunity for public hearing he finds that the State \nof California no longer complies with the conditions of \nthe waiver.\u201d56 EPA also noted that, subject to certain \nlimitations, administrative agencies possess inherent \nauthority to reconsider their decisions in response to \nchanged circumstances: \u201cIt is well settled that EPA has \ninherent authority to reconsider, revise, or repeal past \ndecisions to the extent permitted by law so long as the \nAgency provides a reasoned explanation.\u201d57 This authority \nexists in part because EPA\u2019s interpretations of the statutes \nit administers \u201care not carved in stone.\u201d58 \nFinally, in SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive \nview of section 177 as not authorizing other states to adopt \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG standards for which EPA had granted \na waiver of preemption under section 209(b). Although \nsection 177 does not require states that adopt California\u2019s \n56.\u2002  84 FR at 51332 (citing S. Rep.

EPA stated that nonattainment designations \nexist only as to criteria pollutants and GHGs are not \ncriteria pollutants; therefore, states could not adopt \nGHG standards under section 177. Notably, California in \nprevious waiver requests addressed the criteria pollutant \nbenefits of GHG emissions reductions, specifically related \nto ground level ozone.\nD.\t Petitions for Reconsideration\nAfter issuing SAFE 1, EPA received three petitions \nfor reconsideration urging the Agency to reconsider the \nwaiver withdrawal of the ACC program\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate and to rescind part or all of the \nSAFE 1 action.59 The first Petition for Clarification/\nReconsideration was submitted by the State of California \nand a number of States and Cities on October 9, 2019 \n(California Petition for Clarification).60 These Petitioners \nsought both clarification and reconsideration of the scope \nof SAFE 1. Citing somewhat contradictory statements in \nthe action, they claimed that SAFE 1 created confusion \nregarding which model years of the ACC program were \n59.\u2002  The California Petition for Clarification only sought \nreconsideration of SAFE 1 to the extent it withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver for model years outside those proposed. The other \ntwo petitions sought reconsideration of the full SAFE 1 action. \n60.\u2002  EPA-OAR-2021-0257-0015. \n\n92a\naffected by the waiver withdrawal.61 They based their \nrequest for reconsideration of the withdrawal on the \ngrounds that the SAFE 1 action relied on analyses and \njustifications not presented at proposal and, thus, was \nbeyond the scope of the proposal. \nA second Petition for Reconsideration was submitted \nby several non-governmental organizations on November \n25, 2019 (NGOs\u2019 Petition).62 These Petitioners claimed that \nEPA\u2019s reconsideration of the ACC program waiver was not \na proper exercise of agency authority because the Agency \nfailed to consider comments submitted after the formal \ncomment period\u2014which they charged as inadequate\u2014\nand because the EPA\u2019s rationale was a pretextual cover \n61.\u2002  The California Petition for Clarification notes that, \u201c[i]n the \nFinal Actions, EPA makes statements that are creating confusion, \nand, indeed, appear contradictory, concerning the temporal scope \nof its action(s)\u2014specifically, which model years are covered by the \npurported withdrawal of California\u2019s waiver for its GHG and ZEV \nstandards. In some places, EPA\u2019s statements indicate that it has \nlimited its action(s) to the model years for which it proposed to \nwithdraw and for which it now claims to have authority to withdraw\u2014\nnamely model years 2021 through 2025. In other places, however, \nEPA\u2019s statements suggest action(s) with a broader scope\u2014one \nthat would include earlier model years.\u201d Id. at 2. In SAFE 1, EPA \nwithdrew the waiver for California\u2019s GHG and ZEV standards for \nmodel years 2017-2025 on the basis of EPCA preemption and for \nmodel years 2021-2025 on the basis of the second waiver prong. \n62.\u2002  EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0014.

The late \ncomments summarized in the Petition address SAFE 1\u2019s \nEPCA preemption and second waiver prong arguments. \nOn EPCA preemption, the summarized comments \nasserted that EPCA does not preempt GHG standards \nbecause GHG emission standards are not the \u201cfunctional \nequivalent\u201d of fuel economy standards, as SAFE 1 \nclaimed. On the second waiver prong, the summarized \ncomments asserted both that GHG and ZEV standards \ndo have criteria pollutant benefits, and that the threat of \nclimate change is compelling and extraordinary and will \nhave California-specific impacts. In addition to objections \nto SAFE 1\u2019s EPCA preemption and second waiver prong \narguments, the summarized comments asserted that ZEV \nstandards play a key role in SIPs, which were disrupted \nby SAFE 1. This disruption, Petitioners claimed, violated \n\u201cconformity\u201d rules prohibiting federal actions from \nundermining state\u2019s air quality plans.63 \nA third Petition for Reconsideration was submitted by \nseveral states and cities on November 26, 2019 (States and \nCities\u2019 Petition).64 These Petitioners sought reconsideration \n63.\u2002  These \u201clate comments\u201d can be found in the \u201cAppendix \nof Exhibits\u201d attached to the Petition for Reconsideration. These \ncomments are considered part of EPA\u2019s record for purposes of the \nreconsideration of SAFE 1. \n64.\u2002  See EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0029. This Petition was \njoined by the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \nHawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, \nNew Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nVermont, Washington, Wisconsin, Michigan, the Commonwealths of \nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the District of Columbia, \n\n94a\nof the withdrawal on the grounds that EPA failed to \nprovide an opportunity to comment on various rationales \nand determinations, in particular on its authority to \nrevoke argument, flawed re-interpretation and application \nof the second waiver prong, its flawed new rationale for \nconsidering factors outside section 209(b) (namely, EPCA \npreemption), and its determination that states cannot \nadopt California\u2019s GHG standards under section 177. For \nexample, these Petitioners claimed they did not have an \nadequate opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s use of equal \nsovereignty or the endangerment finding as rationales for \nits new \u201cparticularized nexus\u201d interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong. These Petitioners also claimed that EPA\u2019s \nstatements concerning the burden of proof applicable to \na waiver revocation were either unclear or inaccurate, \nparticularly whether the Agency bears the burden of proof \nin withdrawing a previously granted waiver and, if not, \nhow and why this burden of proof is different from the \nburden of proof for denying a waiver request.65 Finally, \nthese Petitioners asserted that the Agency failed to \nconsider comments, submitted after the formal comment \nperiod, that challenged EPA\u2019s interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong, including new evidence of California\u2019s need \nfor its GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate, \nand alleged that EPA\u2019s rationale was pretextual and \nbased on the Administration\u2019s political animosity towards \nCalifornia and on the oil industry\u2019s influence. \nand the Cities of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and San \nJose. \n65.\u2002  The applicable burden of proof for a waiver withdrawal is \ndiscussed in Section III of this decision. \n\n95a\nEPA notified the petitioners in the above-noted \nPetitions for Reconsideration that the Agency would \nbe considering issues raised in their petitions as part \nof the proceeding to reconsider SAFE 1. This action \naddresses these petitions in the broader context of EPA\u2019s \nadjudicatory reconsideration of SAFE 1 commenced in \nresponse to a number of significant issues with SAFE 1.\nIII.\tPrinciples Governing This Review\nThe CAA has been a paradigmatic example of \ncooperative federalism, under which \u201cStates and the \nFederal Government [are] partners in the struggle against \nair pollution.\u201d66 In Title II, Congress authorized EPA to \npromulgate emission standards for mobile sources and \ngenerally preempted states from adopting their own \nstandards.67 At the same time, Congress created an \nimportant exception for the State of California. \n66.\u2002  General Motors Corp. v. United States, 496 U.S. 530, 532 \n(1990). \n67.\u2002  \u201cThe regulatory difference [between Titles I and II] is \nexplained in part by the difficulty of subjecting motor vehicles, \nwhich readily move across state boundaries, to control by individual \nstates.\u201d Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. \n1996). Congress also asserted federal control in this area to avoid \n\u201cthe specter of an anarchic patchwork of federal and state regulatory \nprograms\u201d nationwide. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, \n627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ( MEMA I ). \n\n96a\nA.\t Scope of Preemption and Waiver Criteria Under \nthe Clean Air Act\nThe legal framework for this decision stems from the \nwaiver provision first adopted by Congress in 1967, and \nsubsequent amendments. In Title II of the CAA, Congress \nestablished only two programs for control of emissions \nfrom new motor vehicles\u2014EPA emission standards \nadopted under the CAA and California emission standards \nadopted under its state law. Congress accomplished this \nby preempting all state and local governments from \nadopting or enforcing emission standards for new motor \nvehicles, while at the same time providing that California \ncould receive a waiver of preemption for its emission \nstandards and enforcement procedures in keeping with \nits prior experience regulating motor vehicles and its \nserious air quality problems. Accordingly, section 209(a) \npreempts states or political subdivisions from adopting \nor attempting to enforce any standard relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles.68 Under the \nterms of section 209(b)(1), after notice and opportunity \nfor public hearing, EPA must waive the application of \nsection 209(a) to California unless the Administrator finds \n68.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(a)-(a) Prohibition No State or any political \nsubdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard \nrelating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines subject to this part. No State shall require \ncertification, inspection, or any other approval relating to the control \nof emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle \nengine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if \nany), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or \nequipment. \n\n97a\nat least one of three criteria to deny a waiver in section \n209(b)(1)(A)-(C) has been met.69 EPA may thus deny a \nwaiver only if it makes at least one of these three findings \nbased on evidence in the record, including arguments that \nopponents of the waiver have provided. This framework \nstruck an important balance that protected manufacturers \nfrom multiple and different state emission standards and \npreserved a pivotal role for California in the control of \nemissions from new motor vehicles. Congress intentionally \nstructured this waiver provision to restrict and limit \nEPA\u2019s ability to deny a waiver and did this to ensure that \nCalifornia had broad discretion in selecting the means \nit determined best to protect the health and welfare of \n69.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1): \n(1) The Administrator shall, after notice and \nopportunity for public hearing, waive application of \nthis section to any State which has adopted standards \n(other than crankcase emission standards) for the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines prior to March 30, 1966, if the \nState determines that the State standards will be, in \nthe aggregate, at least as protective of public health \nand welfare as applicable Federal standards. No such \nwaiver shall be granted if the Administrator finds \nthat\u2014\n(A) the determination of the State is arbitrary and \ncapricious,\n(B) such State does not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, or\n(C) such State standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent with \nsection 7521(a) of this title.\n\n98a\nits citizens in recognition of both the harsh reality of \nCalifornia\u2019s air pollution and to allow California to serve \nas a pioneer and a laboratory for the nation in setting \nnew motor vehicle emission standards and developing \ncontrol technology.70 Accordingly, section 209(b) specifies \nthat EPA must grant California a waiver if California \ndetermines that its standards are, in the aggregate, at \nleast as protective of the public health and welfare as \napplicable Federal standards. \nEPA has consistently interpreted the waiver provision \nas placing the burden on the opponents of a waiver and \nEPA to demonstrate that one of the criteria for a denial \nhas been met. In this context, since 1970, EPA has \nrecognized its limited discretion in reviewing California \nwaiver requests. For over fifty years, therefore, EPA\u2019s role \nupon receiving a request for waiver of preemption from \nCalifornia has been limited and remains only to determine \nwhether it is appropriate to make any of the three findings \nspecified by the CAA. If the Agency cannot make at \nleast one of the three findings, then the waiver must be \ngranted. The three waiver criteria are also properly \nseen as criteria for a denial. This reversal of the normal \nstatutory structure embodies and is consistent with the \ncongressional intent of providing deference to California \nto maintain its own new motor vehicle emission program.\n70.\u2002  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1967) \n(The waiver of preemption is for California\u2019s \u201cunique problems and \npioneering efforts.\u201d); 113 Cong.

Murphy); MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n\n99a\nThe 1970 CAA Amendments strengthened EPA\u2019s \nauthority to regulate vehicular \u201cemission[s] of any air \npollutant,\u201d while reaffirming the corresponding breadth \nof California\u2019s entitlement to regulate those emissions \n(amending CAA section 202 and recodifying the waiver \nprovision as section 209(b), respectively). Congress also \nestablished the NAAQS program, under which EPA \nissues air quality criteria and sets standards for so-called \n\u201ccriteria\u201d pollutants, and states with regions that have \nnot \u201cattained\u201d those federal standards must submit SIPs \nindicating how they plan to attain the NAAQS (which \nis often a multi-year, comprehensive plan). With the \nCAA Amendments of 1977, Congress allowed California \nto consider the protectiveness of its standards \u201cin the \naggregate,\u201d rather than requiring that each standard \nproposed by the State be as or more stringent than its \nfederal counterpart.71 Congress also approved EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the waiver provision as providing \nappropriate deference to California\u2019s policy goals and \nconsistent with Congress\u2019s intent \u201cto permit California to \nproceed with its own regulatory program\u201d for new motor \nvehicle emissions.72 \nIn previous waiver decisions, EPA has noted that \nthe statute specifies particular and limited grounds for \nrejecting a waiver and has therefore limited its review \nto those grounds. EPA has also noted that the structure \nCongress established for reviewing California\u2019s decision-\nmaking is deliberately narrow, which further supports \nthis approach. This has led EPA to reject arguments that \n71.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1). \n72.\u2002  H.R. Rep.

Thus, my consideration of all \nthe evidence submitted concerning a waiver \ndecision is circumscribed by its relevance to \nthose questions that I may consider under \nsection 209(b).73 \nGiven the text, legislative history, and judicial \nprecedent, EPA has consistently interpreted section \n209(b) as requiring it to grant a waiver unless opponents \nof a waiver can demonstrate that one of the criteria for a \ndenial has been met.74 \n73.\u2002  78 FR at 2115 (footnote omitted). \n74.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1120-21 (\u201cThe language of the statute \nand its legislative history indicate that California\u2019s regulations, and \nCalifornia\u2019s determination that they comply with the statute, when \n\n101a\nThe 1977 CAA Amendments additionally demonstrated \nthe significance of California\u2019s standards to the Nation as \na whole with Congress\u2019 adoption of a new section 177. \nSection 177 permits other states addressing their own \nair pollution problems to adopt and enforce California \nnew motor vehicle standards \u201cfor which a waiver has been \ngranted if certain criteria are met.\u201d75 Also known as the \npresented to the Administrator are presumed to satisfy the waiver \nrequirements and that the burden of proving otherwise is on whoever \nattacks them.\u201d); Motor & Equip.

It was in an \neffort to assist those states struggling to meet federal pollution \nstandards that Congress, as noted earlier, directed in 1977 that other \nstates could promulgate regulations requiring vehicles sold in their \nstate to be in compliance with California\u2019s emission standards or to \n\u201cpiggyback\u201d onto California\u2019s preemption exemption. This opt-in \nauthority, set forth in \u00a7177 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7507, is carefully \ncircumscribed to avoid placing an undue burden on the automobile \nmanufacturing industry.\u201d). \n\n102a\n\u201copt-in\u201d provision, section 177 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7507, \nprovides: \nNotwithstanding section 7543(a) of this \ntitle, any State which has plan provisions \napproved under this part may adopt and enforce \nfor any model year standards relating to control \nof emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines and take such other \nactions as are referred to in section 7543(a) of \nthis title respecting such vehicles if\u2014\n(1) such standards are identical to the \nCalifornia standards for which a waiver has \nbeen granted for such model year, and\n(2) California and such State adopt \nsuch standards at least two years before \ncommencement of such model year (as \ndetermined by regulations of the Administrator).\nNothing in this section or in Subchapter II \nof this chapter shall be construed as authorizing \nany such State to prohibit or limit, directly or \nindirectly, the manufacture or sale of a new \nmotor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is \ncertified in California as meeting California \nstandards, or to take any action of any kind to \ncreate, or have the effect of creating, a motor \nvehicle or motor vehicle engine different that a \nmotor vehicle or engine certified in California \nunder California standards (a \u201cthird vehicle\u201d) \nor otherwise create such a \u201cthird vehicle.\u201d\n\n103a\nAny state with qualifying SIP provisions may exercise \nthis option and become a \u201cSection 177 State,\u201d without \nfirst seeking the approval from EPA.76 Thus, over time, \nCongress has recognized the important state role, for \nexample, by making it easier (by allowing California \nto consider its standards \u201cin the aggregate\u201d) and by \nexpanding the opportunity (via section 177) for states to \nadopt standards different from EPA\u2019s standards.77 \n76.\u2002  In 1990 Congress amended the CAA by adding section \n209(e) to section 209. Section 209(e) sets forth the terms of CAA \npreemption for nonroad engines and vehicles and the ability of \nStates to adopt California emissions standards for such vehicles and \nengines if certain criteria are met. 42 U.S.C. 7543(e)(2)(B) (\u201cAny \nState other than California which has plan provisions approved \nunder part D of subchapter I may adopt and enforce, after notice to \nthe Administrator, for any period, standards relating to control of \nemissions from nonroad vehicles or engines . . . if (i) such standards \nand implementation and enforcement are identical, for the period \nconcerned, to the California standards . . . .\u201d).

In waiver decisions, EPA has thus recognized \nthat congressional intent in creating a limited review of \nCalifornia waiver requests based on the section 209(b)(1) \ncriteria was to ensure that the federal government did \nnot second-guess the wisdom of state policy. In an early \nwaiver decision EPA highlighted this deference:\nIt is worth noting * * * I would feel \nconstrained to approve a California approach \nto the problem which I might also feel unable \nto adopt at the federal level in my own capacity \nas a regulator. The whole approach of the Clean \nAir Act is to force the development of new types \nof emission control technology where that is \nneeded by compelling the industry to \u201ccatch \nup\u201d to some degree with newly promulgated \nstandards.

Since a balancing \nof these risks and costs against the potential \nbenefits from reduced emissions is a central \npolicy decision for any regulatory agency under \n\n105a\nthe statutory scheme outlined above, I believe I \nam required to give very substantial deference \nto California\u2019s judgments on this score.78 \nAs noted above, Congress amended the CAA in 1977. \nWithin these amendments, Congress had the opportunity \nto reexamine the waiver provision and elected to expand \nCalifornia\u2019s flexibility to adopt a complete program of \nmotor vehicle emission controls. The House Committee \nReport explained that \u201c[t]he amendment is intended to \nratify and strengthen the California waiver provision \nand to affirm the underlying intent of that provision, \ni.e., to afford California the broadest possible discretion \nin selecting the best means to protect the health of its \ncitizens and the public welfare.\u201d79 \nSAFE 1 was a departure from congressional intent \nand EPA\u2019s typical practice of deference to California \non matters of state public policy regarding how best to \naddress its serious air quality problems. In SAFE 1, \nEPA adopted a new interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) \nmore than five years after the initial grant of the ACC \nprogram waiver and applied it to CARB\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate. Specifically, EPA premised its \nfinding on a consideration of California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for the \n78.\u2002  40 FR at 23104. \n79.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1110 (citing H.R. Rep.

In response to the SAFE \n1 proposal, California had provided further context and \nadditional data on net upstream emissions benefits of the \nZEV sales mandate, but EPA did not consider them in \narriving at the findings and conclusions in SAFE 1. The \nfinal decision in SAFE 1 was not based on the third waiver \nprong.80 EPA also explained in SAFE 1 that the task of \ninterpreting section 209(b)(1)(B) required no deference \nto California.81 \nC.\t Standard and Burden of Proof\nIn Motor and Equipment Manufacturers\u2019 Association \nv.

We need not decide how this standard \noperates in every waiver decision.\u201d83 The court upheld \nthe Administrator\u2019s position that to deny a waiver, there \nmust be clear and compelling evidence to show that the \nproposed procedures undermine the protectiveness of \nCalifornia\u2019s standards. The court noted that this standard \nof proof also accords with the congressional intent to \nprovide California with the broadest possible discretion in \nsetting regulations it finds protective of the public health \nand welfare.84 With respect to the consistency finding, \n82.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1122. \n83.\u2002  Id. \n84.\u2002  Id. \n\n108a\nthe court did not articulate a standard of proof applicable \nto all proceedings but found that the opponents of the \nwaiver were unable to meet their burden of proof even if \nthe standard were a mere preponderance of the evidence. \nAlthough MEMA I did not explicitly consider the \nstandards of proof under section 209 concerning a waiver \nrequest for \u201cstandards,\u201d as compared to accompanying \nenforcement procedures, there is nothing in the opinion \nto suggest that the court\u2019s analysis would not apply with \nequal force to such determinations.

News 1977, p. 1380). \n\n109a\nAs noted earlier, the burden of proof in a waiver \nproceeding is on EPA and the opponents of the waiver. \nThis is clear from the statutory language stating that \nEPA \u201cshall . . . waive\u201d preemption unless one of three \nstatutory factors is met. This reading was upheld by \nthe D.C. Circuit in MEMA I, which concluded that this \nobligation rests firmly with opponents of the waiver in \na section 209 proceeding, holding that: \u201c[t]he language \nof the statute and its legislative history indicate that \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations, and California\u2019s determinations \nthat they must comply with the statute, when presented \nto the Administrator are presumed to satisfy the waiver \nrequirements and that the burden of proving otherwise \nis on whoever attacks them. California must present its \nregulations and findings at the hearing and thereafter \nthe parties opposing the waiver request bear the burden \nof persuading the Administrator that the waiver request \nshould be denied.\u201d86 \nThe Administrator\u2019s burden, on the other hand, is to \nmake a reasonable evaluation of the information in the \nrecord in coming to the waiver decision. As the court in \nMEMA I stated, \u201cHere, too, if the Administrator ignores \nevidence demonstrating that the waiver should not be \ngranted, or if he seeks to overcome that evidence with \nunsupported assumptions of his own, he runs the risk \nof having his waiver decision set aside as \u2018arbitrary and \ncapricious.\u2019\u201d87 Therefore, the Administrator\u2019s burden is \nto act \u201creasonably.\u201d88 \n86.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1121. \n87.\u2002  Id. at 1126. \n88.\u2002  Id. \n\n110a\nIn this instance, EPA has withdrawn a previously \ngranted waiver and is now reconsidering whether that \nwithdrawal was an appropriate exercise of authority, \nwhether the reinterpretation of the second waiver prong \nwas appropriate, and whether EPA\u2019s evaluation and \nfindings of fact under the second waiver prong meet the \napplicable burden of proof in the context of deference to \nCalifornia\u2019s policy choices. EPA believes that the same \nburden that is applicable to those opposed to an initial \nwaiver request from CARB (this applies to any party \nincluding the Administrator as explained in MEMA I ) is \nalso applicable to EPA\u2019s actions in SAFE 1 ( e.g., the burden \nof proof of whether California does not need its standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions rests on \nthose opposing a waiver for California).89 \n89.\u2002  In EPA\u2019s 2009 evaluation of the 2008 GHG waiver denial the \nAgency applied a similar test. See 74 FR at 32745 (\u201cAfter a thorough \nevaluation of the record, I am withdrawing EPA\u2019s March 6, 2008 \nDenial and have determined that the most appropriate action in \nresponse to California\u2019s greenhouse gas waiver request is to grant \nthat request. I have determined that the waiver opponents have not \nmet their burden of proof in order for me to deny the waiver under \nany of the three criteria in section 209(b)(1).\u201d). In the context of \n2009 GHG waiver that reconsidered the Agency\u2019s 2008 GHG waiver \ndenial, EPA determined it was appropriate to apply the same burden \nof proof during the reconsideration as would apply at the time of \nthe initial waiver evaluation. EPA received comment suggesting \nthat the entire burden of proof shifts to California in order for the \nprior 2008 denial to be reversed. EPA, in response, stated that \n\u201c. . . regardless of the previous waiver denial, once California makes \nits protectiveness determination the burden of proof falls on the \nopponents of the waiver . . . . This is consistent with the legislative \nhistory, which indicates that Congress intended a narrow review by \nEPA and to preserve the broadest possible discretion for California.\u201d \nId. at 32749. EPA acknowledges that in SAFE 1 the Agency not only \n\n111a\nIV.\tEPA Did Not Appropriately Exercise Its Limited \nAuthority To Reconsider the ACC Program Waiver \nin SAFE 1\nThe first question this final action tackles is whether \nthe agency properly exercised its reconsideration authority \nto withdraw its previously-granted waiver in SAFE 1. \nEPA concludes that it did not, and on that independent \nbasis rescinds SAFE 1\u2019s waiver withdrawal.\nSection 209 does not provide EPA with express \nauthority to reconsider and withdraw a waiver previously \ngranted to California. EPA\u2019s authority thus stems from its \ninherent reconsideration authority. For several reasons, \nin the context of reconsidering a waiver grant, that \nauthority may only be exercised sparingly. First, EPA \nbelieves its inherent authority to reconsider a waiver \nadopted an interpretation of the second waiver prong which was \nsimilar to the previously rejected interpretation, but that in doing \nso also questioned its previous position that the burden of proof in \nevaluating the need for standards at issue resides with those that \noppose the waiver, including EPA. See 84 FR at 51344 n.268. In \nthis action, however, EPA now finds that the historical deference \nprovided to California regarding its policy choices on how best to \naddress its serious air quality conditions also requires that the \nburden of proof should reside in those seeking to demonstrate that \nstandards are not needed under the second waiver prong regardless \nof whether the rationale is characterized as a new interpretation or \nnot. The language of section 209(b)(1) requires California to make \na protectiveness finding under the first waiver prong. Moreover, \nnothing in section 209(b) could be read as support for drawing a \ndistinction between the burden of proof when the Agency considers \nan initial waiver request and one where the Agency reconsiders \na waiver decision based on a new interpretation of the statutory \ncriteria. That burden properly resides with opponents of the waiver. \n\n112a\ndecision is constrained by the three waiver criteria that \nmust be considered before granting or denying a waiver \nrequest under section 209(b). A contrary approach, which \ntreats reconsiderations as more broadly appropriate, \nwould undermine Congress\u2019 intent that California be \nable to exercise its policy judgments and develop motor \nvehicle controls programs to address California\u2019s air \npollution problems, and make advances which could be \nbuilt on by EPA or adopted by other states. Second, EPA \nbelieves it may only reconsider a previously granted \nwaiver to address a clerical or factual error or mistake, \nor where information shows that factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted have changed so significantly that \nthe propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Even \nwhen EPA is acting within the appropriate bounds of its \nauthority to reconsider, during that reconsideration EPA \nshould exercise its limited authority within a reasonable \ntimeframe and be mindful of reliance interests.\nThe Agency\u2019s reconsideration in SAFE 1 was not an \nappropriate exercise of authority; there was no clerical \nerror or factual error in the ACC program waiver, and \nSAFE 1 did not point to any factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the three waiver prongs that had \nchanged so significantly that the propriety of the waiver \ngrant is called into doubt. Rather, the 2019 waiver \nwithdrawal was based on a change in EPA\u2019s statutory \ninterpretation, an incomplete and inaccurate assessment \nof the record, and another agency\u2019s action beyond the \nconfines of section 209(b). EPA erred in reconsidering \na previously granted waiver on these bases. Moreover, \nin considering the passage of time between the initial \n\n113a\nwaiver and the SAFE 1 action, and the development of \nreliance interests based on the waiver, EPA finds those \nfactors do not support the reconsideration of the ACC \nprogram waiver that occurred in SAFE 1. Accordingly, \nas explained in detail below, EPA is rescinding SAFE 1\u2019s \nwithdrawal of its 2013 ACC program waiver because it \nwas an inappropriate exercise of reconsideration authority.\nA.\t Comments Received\nEPA received several comments in the reconsideration \nproceeding on the Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider \nwaivers. Comments on explicit authority focused on \nwhether any language in section 209(b)(1), on its face, \npermits EPA to reconsider a previously granted waiver. \nSome of these commenters also distinguished between \nthe denial of the 2008 waiver and the reconsideration and \ngrant of the GHG waiver in 2009, and EPA\u2019s grant of the \nACC program waiver in 2013 and the reconsideration and \nwithdrawal of the ACC program waiver in 2019.\nEPA received comments in support of and against \nthe view that EPA has inherent authority to reconsider \nwaivers. As support for EPA\u2019s implied authority to \nreconsider, one commenter cited relevant language from \nthe Senate Committee Report from 1967 that stated, \n\u201cimplicit in [\u00a7209] is the right of [EPA] to withdraw the \nwaiver [if] at any time after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California \nno longer complies with the conditions of that waiver.\u201d90 \n90.\u2002  Urban Air Initiative (Urban Air), Docket No. EPA-HQ-\nOAR-2021-0257-0223 at 22 (quoting S.

Otherwise, EPA would be unable to monitor \nCARB\u2019s continued compliance with the waiver conditions \nin light of updated information.91 The same commenter \nalso argued that an agency generally retains the authority \nto reconsider and correct any earlier decision unless \nCongress acts to displace the authority with a process to \nrectify the Agency\u2019s mistakes and that explicit statutory \nauthority to withdraw a waiver is therefore not necessary, \nbecause \u201cthe power to reconsider is inherent in the power \nto decide.\u201d92 The commenter claimed that, under Chevron, \n\u201c[a]n agency has a \u2018continuing\u2019 statutory obligation to \nconsider the \u2018wisdom of its policy.\u2019\u201d93 \nIn contrast, several commenters maintained that \nsection 209(b) strongly indicates that EPA\u2019s authority to \n91.\u2002  Id. at 21 (\u201cA determination that California\u2019s state standards \nare technologically feasible and appropriate requires complex \ntechnical projections at the frontiers of science, which must be \ncontinually updated \u2018if the actual future course of technology \ndiverges from expectation.\u2019\u201d (quoting NRDC Inc. v.

The 1967 legislative \nhistory provides some indication of congressional intent \nto preserve some implied authority for EPA to reconsider \nprevious waiver decisions, but also to place limitations \non it. This legislative history explains: \u201c[i]mplicit in this \nprovision is the right of the [Administrator] to withdraw \nthe waiver at any time [if] after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California \nno longer complies with the conditions of the waiver.\u201d142 \nThus, from the earliest days of the program it has been \nunderstood that any withdrawal of a waiver should be \ntied to the statutory criteria and California\u2019s compliance \nwith them. This legislative history must be taken into \naccount along with Congress\u2019s intent expressed in the 1977 \nlegislative history, which, as discussed previously, sought \nto ensure deference to California and to strengthen that \nstate\u2019s role in driving emissions-reducing technological \ninnovation. Congress was also mindful to ensure the \nability of other states to adopt California\u2019s standards.143 \nUltimately, EPA concludes it has authority to reconsider \npreviously-granted waivers, but that this authority may \nonly be exercised sparingly. As discussed below, there are \nseveral considerations that support narrow authority to \nreconsider waiver grants. \nFirst and most important, EPA believes its inherent \nauthority to reconsider a waiver decision is constrained \nby the three waiver criteria that must be considered \nbefore granting or denying a waiver request under section \n142.\u2002  S. Rep. No. 90-403, at 34 (1967). \n143.\u2002  See supra Section III.B. \n\n134a\n209(b). It would be inappropriate and inconsistent with \ncongressional intent for EPA to reconsider and withdraw a \nwaiver on a ground outside the limited scope of those which \nCongress specified for EPA to consider when reviewing \na waiver in the first place.144 In the few instances where \nthe Agency reconsidered prior waiver decisions prior to \nSAFE 1, EPA focused its review on the section 209(b) \nstatutory waiver criteria.145 \nA circumscribed approach to reconsideration of \nwaivers is consistent with the deference to California\u2019s \npolicy judgment that Congress built into the waiver \nprocess.146 Congress explicitly required that EPA \u201cshall\u201d \ngrant the waiver unless one of three limited criteria \nare met. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d (versus \u201cmay\u201d) \nwas heavily debated by the enacting Congress, with \nthe successful proponents of \u201cshall\u201d explaining that \nsuch language would \u201cguarantee\u201d that California could \nregulate with the burden placed on EPA to demonstrate \n144.\u2002  See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115 (noting that section 209(b) \ncreates \u201ca narrowly circumscribed proceeding requiring no broad \npolicy judgments\u201d). \n145.\u2002  EPA initiated reconsideration of certain motor-cycle \nstandards, under the third waiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(C), in \norder to \u201cvacate that portion of the waiver previously granted under \nsection 209(b).\u201d 47 FR 7306, 7309 (February 18, 1982).

EPA explained that the balancing of \nrisks and costs against potential benefits from reduced \nemissions is a central policy decision for any regulatory \nagency and substantial deference should be provided to \nCalifornia\u2019s judgement on such matters.156 \nIn addition, limiting reconsideration of waivers \nundergirds Congress\u2019 intent that California would be a \nlaboratory for the country driving emissions-reducing \ntechnological innovation when it created the program in \nthe first place. As the D.C. Circuit explained in MEMA \nI: \u201cThe history of congressional consideration of the \nCalifornia waiver provision, from its original enactment up \nthrough 1977, indicates that Congress intended the State \nto continue and expand its pioneering efforts at adopting \nand enforcing motor vehicle emission standards different \nfrom and in large measure more advanced than the \ncorresponding federal program; in short, to act as a kind \nof laboratory for innovation.\u201d157 Indeed, broad authority \nto reconsider waiver grants could undermine the very \nstructure that Congress built in Title II. Specifically, while \nEPA does not consider section 177 when reviewing waiver \nrequests under section 209, Congress built a structure \nwherein EPA must grant California a waiver under section \n209 unless one of the three statutory criteria are met, and \nthen other states may adopt California\u2019s standards under \nsection 177 as part of their overall air quality programs. \n156.\u2002  40 FR at 23104. \n157.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 110-11. \n\n138a\nLimited inherent authority to reconsider previously-\ngranted waivers as described in this action is important \nto the success of Congress\u2019s structure. \nFinally, even the sentence in the legislative history \nthat suggests EPA has inherent reconsideration authority \nin the first place, and which SAFE 1 relied on for its \nassertion of inherent reconsideration authority, lends \nweight to the view that this authority is limited. According \nto the Senate report from the 1967 CAA amendments, \nthe Administrator has \u201cthe right . . . to withdraw the \nwaiver at any time [if] after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California no \nlonger complies with the conditions of the waiver.\u201d158 That \nspecific circumstance\u2014where California does not comply \nwith the conditions of a waiver\u2014should not be expanded \nto include a gaping hole for discretionary administrative \npolicy changes. \nGiven all of the above considerations, several principles \nemerge. EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider a grant of a waiver, \nwhich is an adjudicatory action by the Administrator, is \nnot open-ended. Any reconsideration is constrained to \nthe criteria that Congress set out in section 209(b). Even \nwithin those statutory criteria, considering all of the \nfactors that weigh in favor of a narrow interpretation of the \nAgency\u2019s authority and the importance of not disrupting \nCongress\u2019s scheme, EPA believes reconsideration is \nlimited to situations where the Agency has made a clerical \nor factual error or mistake, or where information shows \n158.\u2002  S. Rep. No. 90-403, at 34 (1967). \n\n139a\nthat factual circumstances or conditions related to the \nwaiver criteria evaluated when the waiver was granted \nhave changed so significantly that the propriety of the \nwaiver grant is called into doubt. \nEven if the bases for EPA\u2019s reconsideration did satisfy \none of the foregoing conditions such that reconsideration \nmay be appropriate, during that reconsideration EPA \nbelieves it should consider the passage of time and reliance \ninterests. In the context of CAA waiver grants in general, \nand the 2013 ACC program waiver grant in particular, \nCalifornia is relying on its standards to meet short- and \nlong-term emission reduction goals.159 In addition, by the \ntime the SAFE proposal was published, twelve states had \nalready adopted at least one or both of the GHG and ZEV \nstandards.160 Several of these states incorporated these \nadopted standards into their SIPs.161 Several automakers \n159.\u2002  States and Cities at 17-18. \n160.\u2002  Id. at 17. \n161.\u2002  Id. at 10; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources \n(Wisconsin), Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0095 at 1 (\u201cThese \nstandards provide important and necessary reductions in both GHG \nand criteria pollutant emissions needed to meet state and local air \nquality goals and address federal CAA requirements.\u201d); Connecticut \nat 2 (\u201cThese programs enable long-term planning and yield critical \nemission reductions that are critical to meeting Connecticut\u2019s climate \ngoals as well as our statutory obligations to reach attainment with \nthe ozone NAAQs.\u201d); Delaware 2 (\u201cDelaware adopted the California \nLEV regulation and incorporated the LEV and GHG standards into \nthe State Implementation Plan. . . .

Such \nreconsideration could frustrate congressional intent in \ndesigning the waiver program and ultimately discourage \nreliance by the recipient of EPA\u2019s waiver decision (CARB), \nstates that may have adopted CARB\u2019s regulations under \nthe terms of section 177 (and are permitted to enforce \nthe regulations once EPA grants a waiver to California) \nas well as the regulated industry.\nWe now turn to whether the reconsideration in SAFE \n1 was a proper exercise of EPA\u2019s inherent reconsideration \nauthority. As an initial matter, SAFE 1 did not assert \nthat any clerical or factual error or mistake was made \nin the 2013 ACC program waiver. Nor did SAFE 1 point \nto any evidence showing that factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted have changed so significantly that \nmaintain the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards \n(NAAQS) . . . The California ZEV and GHG programs enable long-\nterm planning for both the states and the regulated community and \nhave been drivers of technological change across the industry.\u201d). \n162.\u2002  E.g., Ford at 1; Tesla at n.5, 4; Rivian (as a member of \nNCAT) at 13-14. \n\n141a\nthe propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. For \nexample, SAFE 1 did not assert that California was not \ncomplying with the terms of the waiver. Instead, SAFE 1\u2019s \nreconsideration was premised on retroactive application \nof discretionary policy changes. Therefore, EPA believes \nit did not appropriately exercise its inherent authority in \nSAFE 1 to reconsider the prior ACC program waiver. \nUpon reconsideration, and as further shown in Sections \nV and VI, EPA now believes that SAFE 1 amounted to \nan improper exercise of the Agency\u2019s limited inherent \nauthority to reconsider.163 \nSAFE 1 gave two primary reasons for withdrawing \nthe 2013 ACC program waiver. Neither was an appropriate \n163.\u2002  EPA acknowledges that, in the SAFE 1 proceedings, it had \nnoted that at the time of proposal that CARB had given notice that \nit was considering amending its \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d provision and \nthat by the time of SAFE 1, California had entered into agreements \nwith several automobile manufacturers to accept less stringent \nstandards than the California program or the Federal standards \nas promulgated in 2012. As noted in SAFE 1, EPA believed that \nneither of these matters were necessary for EPA\u2019s action in SAFE \n1, but that they provided further support for the action. 84 FR at \n51334 n.230. By this action, EPA finds that neither of these matters \namounted to a change in circumstances or conditions associated \nwith the three waiver criteria and EPA\u2019s evaluation of the criteria in \nthe ACC program waiver. EPA did not predicate its ACC program \nwaiver on CARB\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision or any changes to \nthe deemed-to-comply provision. (EPA does not take a position as \nto whether that provision has changed in its purpose as a result of \nCARB\u2019s 2018 amendment). Further, to the extent CARB utilized a \ndeemed-to-comply provision or uses non-regulatory mechanisms \nto achieve its air quality objectives, this had no bearing on EPA\u2019s \nassessment of whether CARB has a need for its standards under the \nsecond waiver prong at the time of SAFE 1 or now. \n\n142a\nbasis for reconsideration. First, SAFE 1 premised the \nrevocation on its interpretation of the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), that called for the Agency\u2019s \nscrutiny of specific standards under the waiver rather than \nCalifornia\u2019s program as a whole. As explained in detail in \nSection V of this final action, that statutory interpretation \nis flawed, and EPA does not believe a new statutory \ninterpretation should be the basis of reconsidering the \ngrant of a waiver.\nSAFE 1 premised the withdrawal of the ACC program \nwaiver under section 209(b)(1)(B) on the perceived lack of \nrecord support on the causal link between GHG emission \nstandards and air quality conditions in California.164 Yet, \nthe underlying record from the ACC program waiver, \nand the record of SAFE 1, have shown that CARB\u2019s \nZEV sales mandate and GHG emission standards are \ndesigned to address California\u2019s serious air quality \nproblems, including both its NAAQS pollutants and \na variety of climate impacts from GHG emissions. As \ndiscussed in greater detail in Section V, EPA has since \nat least 2009 recognized that greenhouse gas pollution \nexacerbates criteria pollution, and climate change \nimpacts on California\u2019s air quality conditions ( e.g., heat \n164.\u2002  \u201cCalifornia\u2019s approach in its ACC program waiver request \ndiffered from the state\u2019s approach in its waiver request for MY 2011 \nand subsequent heavy-duty tractor-trailer GHG standards, where \nCalifornia quantified NO X emissions reductions attributed to GHG \nstandards and explained that they would contribute to PM and ozone \nNAAQS attainment.\u201d 84 FR at 51337 n.252 (citing 79 FR at 46256, \n46257 n.15, 46261, 46262 n.75). \n\n143a\nexacerbation of ozone).165 The ACC program was especially \ndesigned to address both criteria and GHG pollution, \n165.\u2002  The first HD GHG emissions standard waiver related to \ncertain new 2011 and subsequent model year tractor-trailers. 79 FR \n46256 (August 7, 2014).

This, too, was an \ninappropriate ground for reconsideration. As earlier \nnoted, EPA believes its inherent authority to reconsider a \nwaiver decision is constrained by the three waiver criteria \nthat must be considered before granting or denying a \nwaiver request under section 209(b). Preemption under \nEPCA is not one of these criteria and was not considered \nin CARB\u2019s ACC program waiver request or in EPA\u2019s \ngranting of that waiver. In fact, in its waiver grant, the \nAgency expressly found that consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA would be inappropriate and unnecessary. \nIn SAFE 1, the Agency did not premise its consideration \nof preemption under EPCA on any of the three statutory \ncriteria. Therefore, EPA believes that SAFE 1 was not \na proper exercise of the authority to reconsider on this \nbasis, and any subsequent action in SAFE 1 to withdraw \nthe ACC program waiver was inappropriate.\nAlthough SAFE 1 was an inappropriate exercise of \ninherent authority given that the Agency did not correct \na factual error and there was no change in factual \n\n146a\ncircumstances so significant that the propriety of the \nwaiver would be called into doubt, it is nevertheless \nrelevant to note that SAFE 1 did not give appropriate \nconsideration to the passage of time and the reliance \ninterests that had developed between the granting and \nthe revocation of the ACC program waiver. Several \nautomakers and industry groups have also indicated \nreliance on these standards, as previously discussed.170 \nCalifornia and section 177 states were, by the time \nof the reconsideration, into the long-term plans they \nhad developed relying on the ACC program waiver \nstandards.171 California and other states rely on waivers \n170.\u2002  E.g., Ford at 1; Tesla at n.5, 4; Rivian (as a member of \nNCAT) at 13-14. EPA notes that it received limited comment on \nwhether reliance interests had formed since the issuance of SAFE \n1 but nothing to demonstrate error in the findings regarding section \n209(b)(1)(C) made within the ACC program waiver.

Further, as discussed elsewhere, the short passage of \ntime since the promulgation of SAFE 1 and ongoing litigation over \nthat action has, as automakers have noted in that briefing, prevented \nautomakers from relying on the waiver revocation.

EPA notes that it has \nadministered the California waiver program for a number of decades \nand acknowledges that emission standards continue to evolve at the \nCalifornia and the federal levels. This evolution in the standards has \nrested on regulatory certainty and the enforceability of CARB\u2019s \nemission standards once a waiver has been issued by EPA under \nsection 209(b) of the CAA.

EPA, however, did not \u201ccondition\u201d its ACC \nprogram waiver on any subsequent actions, including the \nMTE.178 EPA expects its waiver adjudications to be final \nand that appropriate reliance may flow to affected parties. \nMoreover, in this instance EPA did not make any final \ndetermination regarding the third waiver prong at section \n209(b)(1)(C). EPA notes that it has administered the \nCalifornia waiver program for a number of decades and \nacknowledges that emission standards continue to evolve \nat the California and the federal levels. This evolution in \nthe standards has rested on regulatory certainty and the \nenforceability of CARB\u2019s emission standards once a waiver \nhas been issued by EPA under section 209(b) of the CAA. \nEPA\u2019s historic practice of properly affording broad \ndiscretion to California has meant that in almost fifty \nreduce other harmful air pollutants, especially in communities of \ncolor and lower-income communities, which are disproportionately \nimpacted by vehicle pollution.

And while SAFE 1 cited prior reconsideration actions \nas support for the Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider prior \nwaiver decisions, as previously noted, EPA has historically \nlimited reconsideration of prior waived standards to \nstatutory criteria and most important, none of these \nprior reconsideration actions resulted in a revocation.179 \nAs further shown in Sections V and VI, SAFE 1 was the \nresult of a \u201cprobing substantive review of the California \nstandards,\u201d with the Agency substituting its own \njudgment for California\u2019s contrary to both congressional \nexhortation of deference to California and the Agency\u2019s \nreview practice. \nThis present reconsideration is an appropriate \nexercise of the Agency\u2019s reconsideration authority. It is not \nat all clear that the reasons for limiting reconsideration of \nwaiver grants apply to the same degree to reconsideration \nof waiver denials and withdrawals. However, EPA need not \nresolve the question in this action, because this action falls \nwell within the bounds of even the limited authority this \naction concludes the Agency possesses for reconsideration \nof waiver grants. First, this action corrects factual errors \nmade in the SAFE 1 waiver withdrawal. Specifically, \neven under SAFE 1\u2019s flawed interpretation of section \n209(b)(1)(B), SAFE 1 ignored facts demonstrating that \nCalifornia does need the specific standards at issue to meet \n179.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 7310 (affirming the grant of the waiver \nin the absence of \u201cfindings necessary to revoke California\u2019s waiver of \nFederal preemption for its motorcycle fill-pipe and fuel tank opening \nregulations.\u201d). \n\n152a\ncompelling and extraordinary conditions. Second, in this \nreconsideration EPA properly constrains its analysis to \nwhether SAFE 1 made one of the three statutory findings \nnecessary to deny a waiver. Third, this reconsideration \nis timely with respect to the finalization of SAFE 1 and \nlimited, if any, reliance interests have developed as a result \nof SAFE 1 (which has been subject to judicial review since \nits promulgation).\nC.\t Conclusion\nIn SAFE 1, EPA inappropriately exercised its limited \ninherent authority to reconsider the ACC program \nwaiver for several reasons. EPA believes its exercise of \nreconsideration authority to reinterpret the language of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) was not taken to correct any factual \nor clerical error or based upon factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted that have changed so significantly \nthat the propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. \nRather, as discussed in detail in Section V, it was based \nupon a flawed statutory interpretation and a misapplication \nof the facts under that interpretation. Likewise, EPA\u2019s \ndecision to reconsider the ACC program waiver based on \nNHTSA\u2019s rulemaking within SAFE 1, which raised issues \nbeyond the statutory waiver criteria, was inappropriate. \nFor these reasons EPA now believes it is appropriate to \nrescind its actions within SAFE 1.\n\n153a\nV.\t The SAFE 1 Interpretation of Section 209(b)(1)(B) \nwas Inappropriate and, in any Event, California \nmet its Requirements\nEven if SAFE 1\u2019s reconsideration of the 2013 program \nwaiver grant was appropriate, EPA concludes for two \nindependent reasons that its waiver withdrawal in SAFE \n1 based upon its new statutory interpretation was flawed. \nFirst, EPA concludes that the SAFE 1 interpretation of \nthe second waiver prong was not an appropriate reading \nof that second waiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(B). It bears \nnoting that the traditional interpretation is, at least, the \nbetter interpretation. Informed by but separate from the \nfactual analysis discussed next, the Agency finds that the \nnew interpretation set out in SAFE 1 was inconsistent \nwith congressional intent and contrary to the purpose \nof section 209(b). Under the traditional interpretation \nof the second waiver prong, California\u2019s need for its \nown motor vehicle program, including its GHG emission \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate, to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions is clear and the waiver should \nnot have been withdrawn. \nSecond, even if the interpretation in SAFE 1 were \nappropriate, EPA concludes that SAFE 1 incorrectly \nfound that California did not have a need for its specific \nstandards. EPA has evaluated California\u2019s need for both \nrequirements by applying both the traditional and the \nSAFE 1 interpretations of section 209(b)(1)(B). In doing \nso, EPA reviewed the record from the ACC program \nwaiver proceedings, including CARB\u2019s ACC program \nwaiver request and supporting documents, as well as the \ncomments received as part of the SAFE 1 proceeding and \n\n154a\nthe comments received under the present reconsideration \nof SAFE 1.180 The record review focused on salient \npronouncements and findings in the ACC program waiver \ndecision, such as the relationship of both criteria and \nGHG pollutants and the impacts of climate change on \nCalifornia\u2019s serious air quality conditions. For example, \nthe effects of climate change and the heat exacerbation \nof tropospheric ozone is well established. California\u2019s \nACC program is established, in part, to address this. \nCalifornia\u2019s program, including its GHG emission \nstandards, is also designed to address upstream criteria \nemission pollutants. The review did so primarily because \nSAFE 1 premised the withdrawal of the GHG standards at \nissue on the lack of a causal link between GHG standards \nand air quality conditions in California. The review \nincluded EPA\u2019s prior findings regarding heat exacerbation \nof ozone, a serious air quality issue recognized by EPA \nas presenting compelling and extraordinary conditions \nunder the second waiver prong. \n180.\u2002  EPA notes that it reviewed the factual record within the \nACC program waiver proceeding and finds there was no factual error \nin its evaluation of whether CARB\u2019s standards satisfied the second \nwaiver prong. EPA also notes, merely as confirming the finding it \nmade at the time of the ACC program waiver but not for purposes of \nmaking a new factual finding from that made at the time of the ACC \nprogram waiver decision, that the record and information contained \nin the SAFE 1 proceeding as well as the record and information \ncontained in the Agency\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1 (including late \ncomments submitted during the SAFE 1 proceeding and, in some \ncases, resubmitted during the Agency\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1) \nat each point in time clearly demonstrates the need of California\u2019s \nstandards (whether evaluated as a program or as specific standards) \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions within California. \n\n155a\nOn completion of this review, EPA finds no basis for \ndiscounting the ample record support on California\u2019s \nneed for both the GHG standards and the ZEV sales \nmandate to address compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California when using both the traditional \nand SAFE 1 interpretation to the second waiver prong. \nAdditionally, because of the way CARB\u2019s motor vehicle \nemission standards operate in tandem and are designed \nto reduce both criteria and GHG pollution and the ways \nin which GHG pollution exacerbates California\u2019s serious \nair quality problems, including the heat exacerbation of \nozone, the Agency in SAFE 1 should not have evaluated \nCalifornia\u2019s specific \u201cneed\u201d for GHG standards. In sum, \nin reconsidering SAFE 1, and after having now reviewed \nand evaluated the complete factual record, EPA reaffirms \nthat California needs the GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate at issue to \u201cmeet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d\nA.\t Historical Practice\nUnder section 209(b)(1)(B), EPA shall not grant a \nwaiver if California \u201cdoes not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d For \nnearly the entire history of the waiver program, EPA has \nread the phrase \u201csuch State standards\u201d in section 209(b)\n(1)(B) as referring back to standards \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d \nin the root paragraph of section 209(b)(1), which calls \nfor California to make a protectiveness finding for its \nstandards. EPA has interpreted the phrase \u201cin the \naggregate\u201d as referring to California\u2019s program as a \nwhole, rather than each State standard, and as such not \n\n156a\ncalling for the Agency\u2019s standard-by-standard analysis of \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request.181 EPA has thus reasoned that \nboth statutory provisions must be read together so that \nthe Agency reviews the same standards that California \nconsiders in making its protectiveness determination and \nto afford California discretion.182 The D.C. Circuit has \nalso stated that \u201c[t]he expansive statutory language gives \nCalifornia (and in turn EPA) a good deal of flexibility in \nassessing California\u2019s regulatory needs. We therefore find \nno basis to disturb EPA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the \nsecond criterion.\u201d183 \n181.\u2002  \u201cThe interpretation that my inquiry under (b)(1)(B) goes \nto California\u2019s need for its own mobile source program is borne out \nnot only by the legislative history, but by the plain meaning of the \nstatue as well.\u201d 49 FR at 18890. \n182.\u2002  74 FR at 32751 n. 44;.32761 n.104.

In 2008, EPA for the first time \nanalyzed California\u2019s waiver request under an alternative \napproach and denied CARB\u2019s waiver request. EPA concluded \nthat section 209(b) was intended to allow California to \npromulgate state standards applicable to emissions from \nnew motor vehicles to address air pollution problems that \nare local or regional, but that section 209(b)(1)(B) was not \nintended to allow California to promulgate state standards \nfor emissions from new motor vehicles designed to address \nglobal climate change problems. Or, in the alternative, \nEPA concluded that effects of climate change in California \nwere not compelling and extraordinary compared to the \neffects in the rest of the country.189 EPA rejected this view \na little over a year later in 2009 by applying the traditional \ninterpretation in granting California\u2019s waiver request for \nthe same GHG standard, finding no support in the statute \nor congressional intent for the alternative application of \nthe statute.190 \n188.\u2002  74 FR at 32763-65; 76 FR 34693; 79 FR 46256; 81 FR \n95982. \n189.\u2002  73 FR at 12160-64. \n190.\u2002  74 FR at 32744, 32746, 32763 (\u201cThe text of section 209(b) \nand the legislative history, when viewed together, lead me to reject \nthe interpretation adopted in the March 6, 2008 Denial, and to \napply the traditional interpretation to the evaluation of California\u2019s \ngreenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles.

There, EPA posited that section 209(b)(1)\nis BEV, FCV, and PHEVs in order to move advanced, low GHG \nvehicles from demonstration phase to commercialization. CARB \nalso analyzed pathways to meeting California\u2019s long term 2050 GHG \nreduction targets in the light-duty vehicle sector and determined that \nZEVs would need to reach nearly 100 percent of new vehicle sales \nbetween 2040 and 2050. CARB also notes that the \u201ccritical nature \nof the LEV III regulation is also highlighted in the recent effort to \ntake a coordinated look at strategies to meet California\u2019s multiple \nair quality and climate goals well into the future. This coordinated \nplanning effort, Vision for Clean Air: A Framework for Air Quality \nand Climate Planning (Vision for Clean Air) demonstrates the \nmagnitude of the technology and energy transformation needed \nfrom the transportation sector and associated energy production \nto meet federal standards and the goals set forth by California\u2019s \nclimate change requirements. . . . The Vision for Clean Air effort \nillustrates that in addition to the cleanup of passenger vehicles (at \nissue here) as soon as possible as required in the LEV III regulation, \ntransition to zero- and near-zero emission technologies in all on- and \noff-road engine categories is necessary to achieve the coordinated \ngoals. Therefore, EPA believes that CARB\u2019s 2018 and later MY ZEV \nstandards represent a reasonable pathway to reach these longer \nterm goals. Under EPA\u2019s traditional practice of affording CARB the \nbroadest discretion possible, and deferring to CARB on its policy \nchoices, we believe there is a rational connection between California \nZEV standards and its attainment of long term air quality goals. \nWhether or not the ZEV standards achieve additional reductions \nby themselves above and beyond the LEV III GHG and criteria \npollutant standards, the LEV III program overall does achieve \nsuch reductions, and EPA defers to California\u2019s policy choice of the \nappropriate technology path to pursue to achieve these emissions \nreductions.\u201d (footnote omitted)). \n\n164a\n(B) called for a \u201cparticularized nexus\u201d for California\u2019s \nmotor vehicle standards: \u201cCongress enacted the waiver \nauthority for California under section 209(b) against the \nbackdrop of traditional, criteria pollutant environmental \nproblems, under which all three links in this chain bear a \nparticularized nexus to specific local California features: \n(1) Criteria pollutants are emitted from the tailpipes of the \nCalifornia motor vehicle fleet; (2) those emissions of criteria \npollutants contribute to air pollution by concentrating \nlocally in elevated ambient levels, which concentration, in \nturn; (3) results in health and welfare effects ( e.g., from \nozone) that are extraordinarily aggravated in California \nas compared to other parts of the country, with this \nextraordinary situation being attributable to a confluence \nof California\u2019s peculiar characteristics, e.g., population \ndensity, transportation patterns, wind and ocean currents, \ntemperature inversions, and topography.\u201d195 As support for \nthe nexus test, EPA, for the first time in waiver decisions, \nrelied on section 202(a) and its own terms of authority to \ninform interpretation of the second waiver prong.196 In \naddition, EPA relied on legislative history to interpret \n\u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d conditions as a reference \nto \u201cpeculiar local conditions\u201d and \u201cunique problems\u201d in \nCalifornia.197 Accordingly, EPA reasoned that California \n195.\u2002  84 FR at 51339. \n196.\u2002  Id. at 51339-40. \n197.\u2002  Id. at 51342 (quoting S.

The analysis below walks \nthrough the statutory language and history associated \nwith this provision. As part of this discussion, the \nrelationship of this provision and California\u2019s authority \nand deference is highlighted. The two interpretations \nof the waiver prong are then reviewed, presenting the \nAgency\u2019s rationale for its findings of the inappropriate \nSAFE 1 interpretation and support for its conclusion \nabout the better interpretation. Second, as shown below, \nthe factual record before the Agency at the time of SAFE \n1 supports the GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate \nrequirements at issue under either the traditional or \nSAFE 1 interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B).\n1.\t EPA Is Withdrawing the SAFE 1 Section 209(b)(1)(B) \nInterpretation\nExcept for two short-lived exceptions in the context of \nthe 2008 waiver denial and SAFE 1, EPA has consistently \nSierra Nevada winter snowpack in 2014-2015, three of the five \ndeadliest wildfires in state history, and back-to-back years of the \nwarmest average temperatures on record.

As further explained below, all of these aspects \nlend support to the Agency practice of not subjecting \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver requests to review of the specific \nstandards under the second waiver prong, and we agree \nthat the traditional interpretation of section 209(b) is, at \nleast, the better interpretation.\nUnder section 209(b)(1)(B), EPA must grant a waiver \nrequest unless the Agency finds that California \u201cdoes \nnot need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d EPA has historically read the \nphrase \u201csuch State standards\u201d in section 209(b)(1)(B) as \nreferring back to standards \u201cin the aggregate\u201d in section \n209(b)(1), which addresses the protectiveness finding \nthat California must make for its waiver requests. In \naddition, as EPA has explained in the past, reading the \nprovision otherwise would conflict with Congress\u2019s 1977 \namendment to the waiver provision to allow California\u2019s \nstandards to be \u201cat least as protective\u201d as the federal \nstandards \u201cin the aggregate.\u201d This amendment must \nmean that some of California\u2019s standards may be weaker \nthan federal standards counterbalanced by others that \nare stronger. If, however, a waiver can only be granted if \neach standard on its own meets a compelling need, then \nCalifornia could never have a standard that is weaker \nthan the federal standard, rendering Congress\u2019s 1977 \n\n182a\namendment inoperative. Congress would not have created \nthe option for California\u2019s individual standards to be at \nleast as protective \u201cin the aggregate\u201d and then taken that \noption away in the second waiver prong\u2019s \u201ccompelling \nneed\u201d inquiry.\nIn addition, EPA has reasoned that giving effect to \nsection 209(b)(1) means that both subparagraph (b)(1)\n(B) and paragraph (b)(1) must be read together such that \nthe Agency reviews the same standards that California \nconsiders in making its protectiveness determination. \n\u201c\u00a7209 (formerly \u00a7208) was amended to require the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to consider \nCalifornia\u2019s standards as a package, so that California \ncould seek a waiver of preemption if its standards \u2018in \nthe aggregate\u2019 protected public health at least as well as \nfederal standards.\u201d238 \nEPA has thus explained the reasoning for the reading \nof \u201csuch State standards\u201d for instance, as follows:\n[I]f Congress had intended a review of the \nneed for each individual standard under (b)(1)(B), \nit is unlikely that it would have used the phrase \n\u201c. . . does not need such state standards,\u201d which \napparently refers back to the phrase \u201cState \nstandards . . . in the aggregate,\u201d as used in the \nfirst sentence of section 209(b)(1), rather than \nto the particular standard being considered. \n238.\u2002  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

However, because the Agency \nasserted in SAFE 1 that the equal sovereignty doctrine \nformed a gloss on its statutory interpretation of the three \ncriteria, EPA addresses that argument here briefly. In short, \nin SAFE 1, EPA stated that because section 209(b)(1) \nprovides \u201cextraordinary treatment\u201d to California, the \nsecond waiver prong should be interpreted to require a \n\u201cstate-specific\u201d and \u201cparticularized\u201d pollution problem. 257 \nBut section 177\u2019s grant of authority to other states to adopt \nCalifornia\u2019s standards undermines the notion that the \nregulatory scheme treats California in an extraordinary \nmanner. Indeed, if section 209(b) is interpreted to limit the \ntypes of air pollution that California may regulate, it would \ndiminish the sovereignty of California and the states \nthat adopt California\u2019s standards pursuant to section \n177 without enhancing any other state\u2019s sovereignty. \nNor does section 209(b) impose any burden on any state. \nFor these reasons, EPA agrees with commenters who \nargued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby \nCounty is inapposite. In section 209(b), Congress did \nnot authorize \u201cfederal intrusion into sensitive areas of \nstate and local policymaking.\u201d258 Rather, it underscored a \nfoundational principle of federalism\u2014allowing California \nto be a laboratory for innovation. Nor is section 209(b) \nan \u201cextraordinary departure from the traditional \ncourse of relations between the States and the Federal \nGovernment.\u201d259 To the contrary, it is just one of many \n257.\u2002  84 FR 51340, 51347. \n258.\u2002  Shelby County v.

But nothing in section \n209(b)(1)(B) can be read as calling for scrutinizing the \nspecific California standards under the waiver.260 Under \nsection 209(b)(1)(B), EPA is to grant a waiver unless \nCalifornia does not need \u201csuch State standards\u201d (plural). \nEPA interprets section 209(b)(1)(B) to refer back to the \nphrase \u201cin the aggregate\u201d in section 209(b)(1), which was \nadded in the 1977 CAA Amendments when Congress \n260.\u2002  In the 2009 GHG waiver, and again in the 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver, EPA explained that the traditional approach does \nnot make section 209(b)(1)(B) a nullity, as EPA must still determine \nwhether California does not need its motor vehicle program to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions as discussed in the \nlegislative history. Conditions in California may one day improve such \nthat it may no longer have a need for its motor vehicle program, or a \nprogram designed for a particular type of air pollution problem, if \nthe underlying specific air pollutant is no longer at issue. \n\n192a\nremoved the stringency requirements for waiver of \nCalifornia standards allowing instead for standards that \nare not as stringent as comparable federal standards, so \nlong as the standards were \u201cin the aggregate, at least \nas protective of public health and welfare as applicable \nFederal standards.\u201d EPA believes that referring back \nto section 209(b)(1) is appropriate given that it precedes \nthe language prior to section 209(b)(1)(B) and is in \naccord with the deference Congress intended by the 1977 \nAmendments.261 Conversely, EPA believes that under the \nSAFE 1 interpretation California would, of necessity, be \nrequired to make a protectiveness finding for each of the \nspecific standards, and the Agency believes this would be \nan inappropriate outcome from SAFE 1. Under the 1977 \nAmendments, California can \u201cinclude some less stringent \n[standards] than the corresponding federal standards.\u201d262 \nAs previously explained, \u201cCongress could not have given \nthis flexibility to California and simultaneously assigned \nto the state the seemingly impossible task of establishing \nthat \u2018extraordinary and compelling conditions\u2019 exist for \neach standard.\u201d263 \n261.\u2002  EPA had applied the traditional interpretation of the \nsecond waiver prong prior to the 1977 Amendments. \n262.\u2002  See H.R.

Indeed, section 209(b)(1)(C) \ninvolves an analysis of feasibility that can take more than \nthe feasibility and impacts of the new standards into \naccount. The feasibility assessment conducted for a new \nwaiver request focuses on the standards in that request \nbut builds on the previous feasibility assessments made \nfor the standards already in the program and assesses any \nnew feasibility risks created by the interaction between \nthe standards in the petition and the existing standards.265 \nIn sum, EPA now views as inconsistent with \ncongressional intent the SAFE 1 interpretation, which was \na flawed interpretation and also a significant departure \nfrom the traditional interpretation under which the \n264.\u2002  Section 209(b)(1)(C) provides that no such waiver shall \nbe granted if the Administrator finds that \u201csuch State standards \nand accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with \nsection 7521(a) [202(a)] of this title.\u201d \n265.\u2002  For example, in the 2013 ACC waiver that contains CARB\u2019s \nLEV III criteria pollutant standards and GHG emission standards, \nas well as the ZEV sales mandate, EPA assessed information \nsubmitted by CARB regarding the technological feasibility, lead \ntime available to meet the requirements, and the cost of compliance \nand the technical and resource challenges manufacturers face in \ncomplying with the requirements to simultaneously reduce criteria \nand GHG emissions. 78 FR at 2131. \n\n194a\nAgency reviews California\u2019s need for the same standards \nas those that the State determines are \u201cin the aggregate\u201d \nas protective of public health and welfare, under section \n209(b)(1).266 EPA believes the traditional interpretation \nis, at least, the better reading of the statute. \nAs previously explained, in reviewing waiver requests \nEPA has applied the traditional interpretation in the same \nway for all air pollutants, criteria and GHG pollutants \n266.\u2002  84 FR at 51345. EPA notes that in SAFE 1 the following \nrationale was used to interpret both 209(b)(1)(C) and then connect \nit with 209(b)(1)(B): \u201c[B]ecause both sections 209(b)(1)(B) and (C) \nemploy the term \u2018such state standards,\u2019 it is appropriate for EPA \nto read the term consistently between prongs (B) and (C). Under \nsection 209(b)(1)(C), EPA conducts review of standards California \nhas submitted to EPA for the grant of a waiver to determine if they \nare consistent with section 202(a). It follows then that EPA must read \n\u2018such state standards\u2019 in section 209(b)(1)(B) as a reference to the same \nstandards in subsection (C).\u201d Although the Agency has not pointed \nto 209(b)(1)(C) as a basis of statutory construction to support the \ntraditional interpretation of 209(b)(1)(B), EPA nevertheless believes \nit is supportive. EPA notes that the term \u201csuch state standards\u201d in \n209(b)(1)(C) allows the Agency, in appropriate circumstances, to \nreview the consistency of CARB\u2019s suite of standards, for a particular \nvehicle category, with section 202(a). For example, EPA evaluated all \nof the standards (LEV III criteria pollutant, ZEV sales mandate, and \nGHG standards) of the ACC program in recognition of the aggregate \ncosts and lead time associated with CARB\u2019s standards as well as \ntechnologies that may be employed to meet more than one standard. \n78 FR 2131-45. EPA\u2019s assessment under 209(b)(1)(C) is not in practice \na standard-by-standard review.

SAFE 1 then concluded that no nexus exists for \nGHG emissions in California.268 SAFE 1 further posited \nthat California must demonstrate \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary circumstances sufficiently different from \nthe nation as a whole to justify standards on automobile \nemissions which may, from time to time, need to be more \nstringent than national standards.\u201d269 This has resulted \nin potentially different practical results depending on \nwhether GHG standards or criteria emission pollutants \nare at issue, a distinction neither found in nor supported \nby the text of section 209(b)(1)(B) and legislative history. \n267.\u2002  74 FR at 32763-65; 76 FR at 34693; 79 FR at 46256; 81 \nFR at 95982. \n268.\u2002  SAFE 1 also relied on UARG v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427 \n(2014), where the Supreme Court disagreed with the Agency\u2019s \ndecision to regulate all sources of GHG under Titles I and V as the \nconsequence of the Agency\u2019s section 202(a) endangerment finding for \nmotor vehicle GHG emissions. In EPA\u2019s view upon reconsideration \nof SAFE 1, UARG is distinguishable because here the Agency is \nacting under a specific exemption to section 202(a) that allows for \nCalifornia to set its own standards for motor vehicle GHG standards \nunder California state law, and thus, regulate major sources of GHG \nemissions within the State. California\u2019s authority to promulgate \nstandards is neither contingent nor dependent on the Agency\u2019s \nsection 202(a) endangerment finding for GHG. See 74 FR at 32778-80; \n79 FR at 46262. Moreover, as discussed above, EPA\u2019s waiver authority \nunder section 209(b) is coextensive with preemption under section \n209(a). See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1107.

EPA concludes it erred by not properly \nevaluating the statutory interpretation of section 209, \nthe associated legislative history including the policy \ndeference that should be afforded to California to \naddress its serious air quality problems and to serve as \na laboratory for the country, and because the \u201cneed\u201d for \na motor vehicle emission program and related standards \nwithin the program are necessarily better viewed as a \ncomprehensive and interrelated effort to address the \nrange of air quality problems facing California.286 At the \n286.\u2002  As noted previously, in the context of evaluating the \n\u201cneed\u201d for California\u2019s motor vehicle emission standards the Agency \nis informed by the legislative history from 1967 and 1977, whereby \nCalifornia is properly viewed as a laboratory for the country and \nthat its policy decisions on how best to address its serious air quality \nissues, and that deference on the question of \u201cneed\u201d is in order. \nTherefore, EPA believes it misapplied the concept of deference in \nthe context of the second waiver prong application in SAFE 1. See \ne.g., 84 FR at 51344 n.268.

Furthermore, wildfires can increase particulate \nair pollution in the major air basins of California. Together, these \nconsequences of climate change could offset air quality improvements \nthat have successfully reduced dangerous ozone concentrations. \nGiven this \u201cclimate penalty,\u201d as it is commonly called, air quality \nimprovement efforts in many of California\u2019s air basins will need to \nbe strengthened as temperatures increase in order to reach existing \nair quality goals.\u201d). \n\n205a\nunder the SAFE 1 interpretation, EPA sees no reason \nto distinguish between \u201clocal or regional\u201d air pollutants \nversus other pollutants that may be more globally mixed. \nRather, it is appropriate to acknowledge that all pollutants \nand their effects may play a role in creating air pollution \nproblems in California and that EPA should provide \ndeference to California in its comprehensive policy choices \nfor addressing them. Again, even if a new interpretation of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) were appropriate in SAFE 1, and EPA \nbelieves it is not, it is important to note that historically, \ncriteria pollutant reductions have been relevant to section \n209(b)(1)(B). As previously noted, nothing in section 209(b) \ncan be read as calling for EPA to waive preemption only \nif California seeks to enforce criteria pollutant standards. \nThe Administrator is required to waive the preemption \nin section 209(a) unless California \u201cdoes not need such \nState standards to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d293 As also previously noted this is in stark \ncontrast to, for example, section 211(c)(4)(C), which calls for \na waiver of preemption only if a state demonstrates that \na fuel program will result in criteria pollutant reductions \nthat will enable achievement of applicable NAAQS. \nThe first section below focuses on criteria pollution \nreduction, which has long been relevant to section 209\n(b)(1)(B). EPA has never put in doubt that California\u2019s \nserious criteria air pollution problems (such as NAAQS \nnonattainment and the factors that give rise to those \nconditions, including the geographic and climate conditions \nin the State, the number of motor vehicles in California, \n293.\u2002  CAA section 209(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added). \n\n206a\nand local and regional air quality) are \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary,\u201d or that California \u201cneeds\u201d regulations \nthat address such emissions in order to achieve every \nfraction of criteria pollutant emissions it can achieve.294 \nThe factual record before the Agency in 2013 and again \nin 2019 includes ample documentation of criteria emission \nreductions from California\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate.295 Nothing in the record is sufficient to \ndemonstrate that California does not need the ACC \nprogram (or the motor vehicle emission program) or, in \nthe context of the SAFE 1 interpretation, the specific \nGHG emission standards and the ZEV sales mandate to \nmeet compelling needs related to criteria pollution. These \nbenefits have a clear connection to California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for \nits specific GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate, at \nissue under the waiver. The second section below focuses \non the GHG reduction benefits of California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate. EPA acknowledges \nthat California is particularly impacted by climate change, \nincluding increasing risks from record-setting fires, \n294.\u2002  In SAFE 1, EPA found that California\u2019s criteria pollution \nconditions remain \u201ccompelling and extraordinary and that California \nneeds standards to produce any and all reductions in criteria \npollutant emissions.\u201d 84 FR at 51344, 51346. \n295.\u2002  When California originally adopted a ZEV sales mandate \ninto its regulations, a significant factor in support of its action \nwas addressing criteria pollutant emissions. In SAFE 1 EPA \nacknowledged that California\u2019s ZEV mandate initially targeted \nonly criteria pollution. 84 FR at 51329. EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver grant \nrecognized that with California\u2019s ACC program California had \nshifted to relying on the ZEV requirements to reduce both criteria \nand GHG pollution. 78 FR at 2114. \n\n207a\nheat waves, storm surges, sea-level rise, water supply \nshortages and extreme heat, and that climate-change \nimpacts in California are therefore \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary conditions\u201d for which California needs the \nGHG standards and ZEV sales mandate. \na.\t GHG Standards and ZEV Sales Mandates Have \nCriteria Emission Benefits\nAs shown below, criteria pollutant reductions are \ndemonstrably connected to California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for its \nGHG standards and ZEV sales mandate at issue under \nthe waiver.296 EPA first concluded that there is a \u201clogical \nlink between the local air pollution problem of ozone and \nGHGs\u201d in the 2009 California GHG waiver by explaining, \n296.\u2002  In response to comments arguing that upstream emission \nbenefits should not be considered in determining the criteria \npollutant benefits of CARB\u2019 standards or that it is inappropriate to \nelevate stationary source criteria pollutant emissions into a make-\nor-break factor in waivers for motor vehicle emission programs, \nEPA believes it appropriate to reiterate the air quality problems \nfacing California, as evidenced by NAAQS attainment challenges. \nWaiver practice and applicable case law, as previously noted, afford \nCalifornia wide deference in its policy and regulatory approaches \nin addressing these challenges. Therefore, EPA believes that to \nthe degree a nexus between CARB\u2019s standards and addressing its \nserious air quality problems is required, that it is reasonable to base \nthe need on related criteria emission impacts. EPA notes that, in \nsetting its federal light-duty vehicle GHG standards, it is afforded \ndiscretion under the CAA to consider upstream emission impacts \nand does include such consideration in its own rulemakings. 77 FR \n62624, 62819 (October 15, 2012) (taking fuel related upstream GHG \nemissions into account in setting compliance values for vehicle GHG \nemissions standards). \n\n208a\nfor instance, that \u201cthe impacts of global climate change can \nnevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution problem.\u201d297 \nMoreover, as previously explained, in two additional GHG \nwaiver requests and associated EPA waiver decisions since \nthe 2009 GHG waiver, EPA acknowledged that CARB had \ndemonstrated the need for GHG standards to address \ncriteria pollutant concentrations in California. In the 2014 \nHD GHG waiver request, CARB projected, for example, \n\u201creductions in NO X emissions of 3.1 tons per day in 2014 \nand one ton per day in 2020\u201d in California.298 \n297.\u2002  74 FR at 32763.

EPA explained that CARB had linked those \nprior waived GHG standards to criteria pollutant benefits \nbut had not done so in the ACC program waiver request: \n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s approach in its ACC program waiver request \ndiffered from the state\u2019s approach in its waiver request \nfor MY 2011 and subsequent heavy-duty tractor-trailer \nGHG standards, where California quantified NO X \nemissions reductions attributed to GHG standards and \nexplained that they would contribute to PM and ozone \nNAAQS attainment.\u201d299 Moreover, how CARB attributes \nthe pollution reductions for accounting purposes from \nits various standards does not reflect the reality of how \nthe standards deliver emissions reductions and should \nnot drive whether or not a waiver can be withdrawn. \nEPA believes, based on its historical deference to CARB \nin waiver proceedings, that CARB is entitled to this \ndiscretion. \nEPA also believes that prior waiver decisions indicate \nthat the \u201capproach\u201d taken by California in its waiver \nrequests needs to be carefully assessed and understood \nby the Agency before discounting the benefits of its \nmobile source emission standards.

The LEV III criteria pollutant fleet \nstandard is responsible for those emission reductions in \nthe fleet; the fleet would become cleaner regardless of \nthe ZEV regulation because manufacturers would adjust \ntheir compliance response to the standard by making less \npolluting conventional vehicles.\u201d304 But, as discussed above, \nthat was merely an attribution of benefits and did not \nreflect the practical reality of how California\u2019s standards \nwork. Moreover, the paragraph in its entirety goes on to \nexplain that CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate would achieve \ncriteria emission reductions: \u201cHowever, since upstream \ncriteria and PM emissions are not captured in the LEV \nIII criteria pollutant standard, net upstream emissions \nare reduced through the increased use of electricity and \nconcomitant reductions in fuel production.\u201d305 \n303.\u2002  84 FR at 51337. \n304.\u2002  Id. at 51337, 51330, 51337, 51353-54, 51356, 51358. \n305.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 15-16. CARB also noted that \ncriteria and PM emission benefits will vary by region throughout \nthe State depending on the location of emission sources.

As \nrefinery operations reduce production and emissions, the input \n\n212a\nIt bears note that this attribution of criteria pollutant \nreductions was similar to the one that CARB made \nalmost a decade ago for the 2009 GHG waiver request.306 \nFor example, CARB provided \u201cextensive evidence of \nits current and serious air quality problems and the \nincreasingly stringent health-based air quality standards \nand federally required state planning efforts to meet \nthose standards firmly.\u201d307 The States and Cities also \ncommented that \u201cthe attribution CARB made as part \nof its waiver request was never intended to, and did not, \nestablish the absence of any vehicular emission benefits \nfrom the ZEV standard.\u201d EPA believes that CARB\u2019s \nstatement was merely a \u201csimplification that distinguished \nthe standards based on the primary objectives of the \ntwo, complementary standards.\u201d308 EPA agrees that the \nand output activities, such as truck and ship deliveries, will also \ndecline.

EPA also noted that \u201cthe better interpretation of the text and \nlegislative history of this provision is that Congress did not intend \nthis criterion to limit California\u2019s discretion to a certain category \nof air pollution problems, to the exclusion of others. In this context \nit is important to note that air pollution problems, including local or \nregional air pollution problems, do not occur in isolation. Ozone and \nPM air pollution, traditionally seen as local or regional air pollution \nproblems, occur in a context that to some extent can involve long \nrange transport of this air pollution or its precursors. This long-\nrange or global aspect of ozone and PM can have an impact on local \nor regional levels, as part of the background in which the local or \nregional air pollution problem occurs.\u201d 78 FR at 2128. \n316.\u2002  CARB comment at EPA-HQ-OAR-2018-0283-5054 at 305-\n06 (California\u2019s Fourth Climate Assessment; https://www.energy.\nca.gov/sites/default/files/2019-12/Governance_External_Ekstrom_\nada.pdf ). \n\n218a\nimpacts on, for instance, the extent of ocean acidification.317 \nThus, like criteria pollution, emissions of GHGs can lead \nto locally elevated concentrations with local impacts, in \n317.\u2002  See, for example, reports from California\u2019s Fourth Climate \nChange Assessment, \u201cCalifornia Mussels as Bio-indicators of Ocean \nAcidification,\u201d available at https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/\nfiles/2019-12/Oceans_CCCA4-CNRA-2018-003_ada.pdf (\u201cBecause of \nthe coupling between natural (upwelling-driven) and anthropogenic \n(CO2 emission-driven) processes, California waters are already \nexperiencing declines in pH that are not expected in other areas of \nthe world\u2019s oceans for decades (Feely et al. 2008; Chan et al. 2017). \nThese perturbations to seawater chemistry join others associated \nwith changing seawater temperatures (Garc\u00eda-Reyes and Largier \n2010) and reductions in ocean oxygenation (Bograd et al. 2008; \nChan et al. 2008). Therefore, marine communities along the coast \nof California are increasingly subjected to a suite of concurrent \nenvironmental stressors. Substantial impetus exists to understand, \nquantify, and project biological and ecological consequences of these \nstressors, which current work suggests may be pervasive and diverse \n(Kroeker et al. 2010, 2013; Gaylord et al. 2015).\u201d). Further, evidence \nin the record from a 2019 study demonstrated that locally enhanced \ncarbon dioxide concentrations above Monterey Bay, California, \nfluctuate by time of day likely because of the magnitude of nearby \nurban carbon dioxide pollution and the effects of topography on \noffshore winds, and that this fluctuation increases the expected rate \nof acidification of the Bay. See Northcott, et al., Impacts of urban \ncarbon dioxide emissions on sea-air flux and ocean acidification \nin nearshore waters, PLoS ONE (2019). For decades, the monthly \naverage carbon dioxide concentrations off California\u2019s coast have \nbeen consistently higher and more variable than those at Mauna \nLoa (which are commonly used as the global measurements).

For instance, \u201cCARB project[ed] \nthat the standards will reduce car CO 2 emissions by \napproximately 4.9%/year, reduce truck CO 2 emissions \nby approximately 4.1%/year (the truck CO 2 standard \ntarget curves move downward at approximately 3.5%/\nyear through the 2016-2021 period and about 5%/year \nfrom 2021-2025), and reduce combined light-duty CO 2 \nemissions by approximately 4.5%/year from 2016 through \n2025.\u201d318 CARB also projected that its GHG emissions \nstandards for MYs 2017-2025 will reduce fleet average CO \n2 levels by about 34 percent from MY 2016 levels of 251 g/\nmile down to about 166 g/mile, based on the projected mix \nof vehicles sold in California.\u201d319 CARB further noted that \nthere might be a GHG emission deficit if only the Federal \nGHG standards were implemented in California.320 The \nGHG emissions from California cars, therefore, are \nparticularly relevant to both California\u2019s air pollution \nproblems and GHG standards at issue. \nIn SAFE 1, EPA dismissed California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for \nthe GHG standards at issue because their impact on GHG \nemissions would be too small to \u201cmeaningfully address \nglobal air pollution problems of the sort associated with GHG \n318.\u2002  78 FR at 2139. \n319.\u2002  Id. at 2135. \n320.\u2002  Id. at 2122. \n\n220a\nemissions\u201d: \u201c[T]he most stringent regulatory alternative \nconsidered in the 2012 final rule and [Final Regulatory \nImpact Analysis] . . . , which would have required a seven \npercent average annual fleetwide increase in fuel economy \nfor MYs 2017-2025 compared to MY 2016 standards, was \nforecast to decrease global temperatures by only 0.02 \u00b0C in \n2100.\u201d321 EPA also received similar comments in response \nto the Notice of Reconsideration.

Ample record support exists on \nCalifornia\u2019s need for both GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate at issue to address compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California. As noted above, in SAFE 1 EPA, \nhowever, relied on an excerpt of the ACC program waiver \nrecord to determine the lack of criteria emission benefits \nof GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate at \nissue.

EPA believes that the \nburden of proof had not been met in SAFE 1, based on the \ncomplete factual record, to demonstrate that California \ndid not have a need for the GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate under the SAFE 1 interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong nor had the burden been met to support a \n339.\u2002  Ford Motor Co. v.

EPA confirms the traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) was appropriate \nand continues to be, at least, a better interpretation \nregardless of the recission of the SAFE 1 interpretation \nof this criterion.341 \nVI.\tEPA Inappropriately Considered Preemption Under \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in \nIts Waiver Decision\nSAFE 1\u2019s other justification for withdrawing the ACC \nprogram waiver was that California\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate were preempted under EPCA. \nAs explained in detail in Section IV, EPA believes this \nbasis for reconsideration was outside the appropriate \nbounds of EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider previously \ngranted waivers. In particular, if EPA could reconsider \nand withdraw a waiver based on a factor not contained \nin the specified criteria for denial in section 209(b)(1), \nEPA could circumvent the specified criteria for denial via \nreconsideration of previously granted waiver.\nEven if it were appropriate for EPA to reconsider a \npreviously granted waiver based on non-statutory factors, \nin this action, EPA concludes that it was inappropriate to \n341.\u2002  See 84 FR at 51344 n.269. \n\n228a\nrely on preemption under EPCA as a basis for withdrawing \ncertain aspects of the ACC program waiver. In SAFE 1, a \njoint action between NHTSA and EPA, NHTSA concluded \nthat state or local regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide \nemissions are \u201crelated to fuel economy standards\u201d and \nare therefore preempted under EPCA.342 As a direct \nresult of NHTSA\u2019s codified text and pronouncements on \npreemption set forth in SAFE 1, EPA withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver for California\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate on grounds that they were preempted under \nEPCA. In SAFE 1, EPA believed it was appropriate to \nconsider the effect of NHTSA\u2019s actions, including the \nview that California cannot enforce standards that are \nvoid ab initio, and thus EPA stated that \u201cto the extent \nthat administrative action is necessary on EPA\u2019s part to \nreflect that state of affairs, EPA hereby withdraws that \nprior grant of a waiver on this basis.\u201d343 NHTSA has \nsince issued a new final rule that formally repeals the \n342.\u2002  49 U.S.C. 32919(a) (\u201cWhen an average fuel economy \nstandard prescribed under this chapter is in effect, a State or a \npolitical subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or \nregulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy \nstandards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy \nstandard under this chapter.\u201d). NHTSA noted that a law or regulation \nhaving the direct or substantial effect of regulating or prohibiting \ntailpipe carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles or automobile \nfuel economy is a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards \nand expressly preempted under 49 U.S.C. 32919(a). 84 FR at 51317-\n18.

Upon reconsideration, \nEPA now believes that, given NHTSA\u2019s repeal of its \nregulation and pronouncements in SAFE 1, preemption \nunder EPCA cannot serve as a basis for the withdrawal of \nthe ACC program waiver as it did in SAFE 1\u2014if it could \never legitimately serve as such basis. EPA thus believes \nit is appropriate to rescind the portion of the waiver \nwithdrawal that was based on preemption under EPCA. \nIn addition, given the unique consideration of \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1 and its effect on an \notherwise validly issued waiver under the CAA, EPA \nbelieves it is helpful to provide additional information \nregarding the Agency\u2019s historical practice and views \nto demonstrate why consideration of preemption under \nEPCA was inappropriate. Consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA is beyond the statutorily prescribed criteria \nfor EPA in section 209(b)(1). Preemption under EPCA \nwas not a factor that California addressed under the \napplicable waiver criteria in its initial request nor was it a \nfactor that EPA considered in granting the ACC program \nwaiver. Until SAFE 1, the Agency consistently refrained \nfrom reviewing waiver requests against factors beyond \nthe statutorily listed criteria under section 209(b)(1). \nThus, EPA also believes that in the reconsideration of a \nwaiver where EPA had previously declined to consider \npreemption under EPCA, SAFE 1 was contrary to \ncongressional intent and the Agency\u2019s historic practice of \nhewing to section 209(b)(1) statutory criteria in reviewing \nwaiver requests. Given this backdrop, EPA believes that \nthe joint rulemaking context of SAFE 1 was an improper \n\n230a\nbasis to deviate from EPA\u2019s long held belief to not consider \nfactors outside the scope of section 209(b)(1), especially \ngiven that the Agency indicated it would only be a \nsingular occurrence. EPA continues to view the text and \ncongressional intent of the statute, as well as subsequent \ncase law, as best supporting a limited scope of review for \nwaiver requests under section 209(b)(1)\u2014irrespective of \nwhether a waiver proceeding is undertaken either solely \nby EPA or in unison with another agency. Therefore, based \non EPA\u2019s historical practice of not considering factors \noutside of the section 209(b)(1) criteria and because EPA \nbelieves the \u201cjoint-action\u201d premise was improper, the \nAgency is rescinding its withdrawal of the ACC program \nwaiver based on preemption under EPCA.\nA.\t Historical Practice and Legislative History\nHistorically, in reviewing California\u2019s waiver requests, \nEPA has refrained from the consideration of factors \nbeyond those criteria set out in section 209(b)(1).344 \n344.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (rejecting objections to the \nprocedures at state level, objections that section 207(c)(3)(A) \nestablishes field protection, and constitutional objections all as \nbeyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review); 74 FR \nat 32783 (rejecting comments asking for the consideration of EPCA \nbecause it is not one of the three statutorily prescribed criteria); 78 \nFR at 2145 (again rejecting comments asking for the consideration \nof EPCA because it is outside the statutory criteria); 79 FR at \n46265 (rejecting the argument that the HD GHG Regulations \n\u201cimpermissibly regulate fuel economy\u201d because, like the commerce \nclause and Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of \n1994 (FAAAA) issues, this issue is \u201coutside the proper scope of \nreview since it is not among the criteria listed under section 209(b).\u201d). \n\n231a\nEPA has generally explained that the text, structure, \nand purpose of the California waiver provision indicate \ncongressional intent for EPA to provide significant \ndeference to California\u2019s judgment, especially on \n\u201cambiguous and controversial matters of public policy.\u201d345 \nIn section 209(a), Congress generally preempted state \nstandards relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles and engines, but, in section 209(b), \nCongress carved out an exception for California, directing \nEPA to grant California a waiver of section 209(a) unless \nthe Agency can make a finding under section 209(b). \nCongress recognized that California\u2019s \u201ccompelling \nand extraordinary circumstances,\u201d and its historical \npractice of regulating in the area, were sufficient \u201cto \njustify standards on automobile emissions which may, \nfrom time to time, need be more stringent than national \nstandards.\u201d346 In creating the waiver program, Congress \nintended not only for California to be able to meet its own \nemission reduction needs, but also for California to act \nas \u201ca kind of laboratory for innovation\u201d for motor vehicle \nstandards and control technology.\u201d347 Thus \u201cCongress \n345.\u2002  78 FR at 2112, 2115; 40 FR at 23103-04; 58 FR 4166. \n346.\u2002  H.R.

The D.C. Circuit has stated that, \nunder the text of the statute, the section 209(b) criteria \nare \u201cthe only waiver standards with which California \nmust comply\u201d and that, therefore, \u201c[i]f EPA concludes \nthat California\u2019s standards [meet section 209(b)], it is \nobligated to approve California\u2019s waiver application.\u201d353 \nThe D.C. Circuit has repeatedly described EPA\u2019s waiver \napproval role as \u201climited\u201d and \u201cnarrow.\u201d In MEMA I, for \nexample, the court explained that \u201cthe Administrator \nhas consistently held since first vested with the waiver \nauthority, [that] his inquiry under section 209 is modest \nin scope.

Some commenters agreed that the context of a \njoint action necessitated consideration of preemption under \nEPCA because NHTSA was the agency charged with \ninterpreting and implementing EPCA and so EPA must \nconsider its findings in the same action.374 One commenter \nalso argued that the joint rulemaking of SAFE 1 would be \nconsistent with pronouncements in Massachusetts v. EPA \n(2007) on the agencies\u2019 respective statutory obligations \nand the need to avoid inconsistency and so, \u201c[o]nce NHTSA \nproposed to finalize a determination that EPCA preempts \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG motor vehicle standards, it would be \nunreasonable for the EPA to refuse to take NHTSA\u2019s \naction into account.\u201d375 \nOther commenters argued that the context of the \nrulemaking, whether joint or not, was irrelevant. One \ncommenter stated emphatically that \u201cwhat Congress \ndirected EPA to consider when it wrote Section 209(b)(1) \ndoes not change depending on whether EPA acts alone or \nwith another agency.\u201d376 Some commenters also argued \nthat the context of the rulemaking was a particularly \ninsufficient justification for revoking the waiver given \nlanguage in SAFE 1 that allowed for inconsistent \nconsideration of EPCA preemption. Several commenters \nnoted that EPA constrained the future applicability of \nSAFE 1 by explaining that the Agency would not consider \nfactors outside statutory criteria in future waiver reviews \n374.\u2002  See, e.g., CEI at 11-12; AFPM at 2, 6. \n375.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n376.\u2002  States and Cities at 20.

Commenters argued that EPA\u2019s \nauthority to look outside the statutory criteria at EPCA \nwas at least permissive, if not mandatory. According to \none commenter, \u201cEPA exaggerates the Court\u2019s position\u201d \nin MEMA I in its Reconsideration notice: \u201c[T]he court did \nnot say that the EPA is forbidden to take constitutional \nramifications into consideration, only that it is not required \nto do so.\u201d379 Another commenter agreed that MEMA I \nand MEMA II \u201cdo not preclude EPA from considering\u201d \npreemption under EPCA but then went further, saying \nthat \u201cEPA is required to consider EPCA preemption.\u201d380 \nThe commenter argued that MEMA I rejected petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional objections to a waiver under an institutional \n377.\u2002  NESCAUM at 3; Twelve Public Interest Organizations \nat app. 1 64-65; States and Cities at 20. \n378.\u2002  SCAQMD at 7 (quoting 86 FR at 22439, n.40). \n379.\u2002  CEI at 10 (original emphasis). \n380.\u2002  AFPM at 5-6. \n\n241a\ncompetence line of reasoning, concluding that \u201c[t]he \nwaiver proceeding produces a forum ill-suited to the \nresolution of constitutional claims.\u201d381 In contrast, they \ncontinued, the waiver proceeding is an appropriate forum \nfor determining whether emission standards \u201crelate to\u201d \nfuel economy because this issue is \u201cwithin the agency\u2019s \ncompetence, as this relationship is mathematical and based \nin science rather than understandings of Constitutional \nlaw and precedent.\u201d382 However, the other commenter, \nwho agreed that EPA is not \u201cforbidden\u201d from considering \npreemption under EPCA, also noted that EPA \u201chas no \nspecial competence to interpret EPCA.\u201d383 \nSeveral commenters also argued that EPA could not \nreinstate the waiver because NHTSA concluded that \nEPCA preempts the standards, such standards were void \nab initio, and therefore \u201cthe state mandates referenced \nin CA\u2019s petition for reconsideration are not even eligible \nto be considered for a CAA waiver of preemption.\u201d384 To \n381.\u2002  Id. at 6 (quoting MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1114-15 (DC \nCir. 1979)). \n382.\u2002  Id. \n383.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n384.\u2002  NADA at 3-4; See also AFPM at 3 (\u201cSince California\u2019s \nGHG tailpipe standards and ZEV mandate are related to fuel \neconomy, they are not lawfully adopted and void ab initio \u2014and \nthere is nothing for EPA to reinstate.\u201d); Urban Air at 47-48; CEI at \n2 (\u201cBut EPCA preemption is the proverbial elephant in the room. \nIf SAFE 1\u2019s EPCA preemption argument is correct, the EPA could \nnot grant a valid CAA preemption waiver for California\u2019s tailpipe \nCO 2 standards and ZEV mandates, because EPCA had already \n\n242a\nignore this, they claimed, would violate the Supremacy \nClause of the Constitution.

Specifically, NHTSA has issued a new final \nrule that formally repeals the codified text and additional \npronouncements regarding preemption under EPCA \nfound in SAFE 1.394 In SAFE 1, EPA stated that it was \nappropriate to consider the effect of NHTSA\u2019s actions, \nincluding the view that California cannot enforce \nstandards that are void ab initio and thus EPA stated \nthat \u201cto the extent that administrative action is necessary \non EPA\u2019s part to reflect that state of affairs, EPA hereby \nwithdraws that prior grant of a waiver on this basis.\u201d395 \nSince this condition no longer exists, EPA believes it is \nappropriate to rescind the waiver withdrawal that was \n393.\u2002  86 FR at 22429. \n394.\u2002  86 FR 74236. NHTSA notes in this rulemaking that \u201cthe \nAgency is repealing all regulatory text and appendices promulgated \nin the SAFE I Rule. In doing so, the Agency underscores that any \npositions announced in preambulatory statements of prior NHTSA \nrulemakings, including in the SAFE I Rule, which purported \nto define the scope of preemption under the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act (EPCA), do not reflect the Agency\u2019s reconsidered \nunderstanding of its proper role in matters of EPCA preemption.\u201d \n395.\u2002  EPA distinguished these previous single-agency actions \nfrom its joint action context by explaining that ignoring NHTSA\u2019s \ndetermination of preemption in the same action, \u201cwould place the \nUnited States Government in the untenable position of arguing that \none federal agency can resurrect a State provision that, as another \nfederal agency has concluded and codified, Congress has expressly \npreempted and therefore rendered void ab initio.\u201d 84 FR at 51338. \n\n246a\nbased on preemption under EPCA. EPA believes that, \nto the extent it was ever appropriate for the Agency to \nbase its action on NHTSA\u2019s finding of preemption under \nEPCA in SAFE 1, the repeal of the preemption rule makes \nit likewise appropriate to rescind the Agency\u2019s action \nin SAFE 1. This would also act to minimize regulatory \nuncertainty as to do otherwise would create further \nconfusion that resulted from the joint action in SAFE \n1 and would not appropriately reflect the current state \nof affairs under the circumstances of a unique federal \nregulation that had otherwise motivated EPA\u2019s actions \nin SAFE 1. NHTSA\u2019s recent action also supports EPA\u2019s \nbelief that its practice of limiting its review of section \n209(b) criteria, as explained below, remains appropriate \nin the context of preemption under EPCA. \n2.\t EPA Improperly Deviated From Its Historical \nPractice of Limiting Its Review to Section 209(b) \nCriteria\nSection 209(b)(1) of the Act limits the Agency\u2019s \nauthority to deny California\u2019s requests for waivers to \nthe three criteria contained therein and the Agency \nhas consistently refrained from reviewing California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers based on any other criteria. EPA \nacknowledges that California adopts its standards as \na matter of law under its state police powers, that the \nAgency\u2019s task in reviewing waiver requests is limited to \nevaluating California\u2019s request according to the criteria \nin section 209(b), and that it is appropriate to defer to \nlitigation brought by third parties in other courts, such \nas state or federal district court, for the resolution of any \n\n247a\nconstitutionality claims and assertions of inconsistency \nwith other statutes. Considering the lack of statutory and \nprecedential support as shown below, even if EPA were \nto have discretion to consider criteria outside section \n209(b), EPA now views the joint-action context of SAFE \n1 as an insufficient justification for deviating from its \nstatutory authority and the Agency\u2019s historical practice \nand therefore the Agency rescinds its actions regarding \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1. \nWithdrawal of the waiver was premised on NHTSA\u2019s \npreemption regulations in what EPA explained was a \njoint rulemaking action. But nothing in section 209(b) \ncan be read as calling for consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA in evaluating waiver requests regardless of \nwhether EPA engaged in joint rulemaking with another \nagency or acted alone. Specifically, under section 209(b), \nEPA must grant California a waiver of the preemption \ncontained in section 209(a) unless the Administrator \nmakes a finding under any one of the listed criteria: \n\u201cThe Administrator shall . . . waive application of the \npreemption in section 209(a) if the Administrator finds \nany of the following: \u2018(A) [California\u2019s] determination \n[that its standards in the aggregate will be at least as \nprotective] is arbitrary and capricious, (B) [California] \ndoes not need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions, or (C) such State standards and \naccompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith section [202(a)].\u2019\u201d396 Evaluation of preemption under \nEPCA is not a listed criterion. \n396.\u2002  CAA section 209(b)(1)(A)-(C). \n\n248a\nNor did SAFE 1 premise preemption under EPCA on \nany of the three statutory criteria. In the ACC program \nwaiver request, CARB made a protectiveness finding \nthat, as a quantitative matter, its standards, in the \naggregate, were as protective as the Federal standards \nand did not address preemption under EPCA.397 In \nfact, while California might opt to respond to comments \non preemption under EPCA, California would not be \nexpected to take it into account in any protectiveness \nfinding made for a waiver request. It bears note that \nCalifornia\u2019s practice is not unusual because there are \nother factors and provisions of the CAA that California \ndoes not account for in making its protectiveness finding \nunder section 209(b)(1).398 In granting the ACC program \nwaiver request, EPA found that California\u2019s protectiveness \nfinding was neither arbitrary nor capricious.399 EPA \nalso responded to comments on the consideration of \npreemption under EPCA in granting the waiver but \ndismissed such objections as outside the scope of its \nreview.400 Historically, EPA draws a comparison between \nthe numerical stringency of California and federal \nstandards in making the requisite finding as to whether \nCalifornia\u2019s protectiveness determination is arbitrary and \n397.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 15-17. \n398.\u2002  For example, \u201cCalifornia is not required to comply with \nsection 207 to get a waiver.\u201d MEMA II, 142 F.3d 449, 467 (D.C. Cir. \n1989). \n399.\u2002  78 FR at 2125. \n400.\u2002  Id. at 2145. \n\n249a\ncapricious.401 Thus, neither California\u2019s initial request, \nnor EPA\u2019s waiver grant, considered preemption under \nEPCA and as previously explained in the ACC program \nwaiver, EPA declined to consider preemption under EPCA \nviewing it as outside the scope of Agency review. \nSAFE 1 made clear that consideration of and reliance \non preemption under EPCA was the consequence of \nregulations promulgated by NHTSA. As SAFE 1 also \nacknowledged, however, EPA does not \u201cadminister\u201d \nEPCA; that task falls to NHTSA.402 Instead, \u201c[i]f EPA \nconcludes that California\u2019s standards [meet section \n209(b)], it is obligated to approve California\u2019s waiver \napplication.\u201d403 EPA therefore disagrees with the comment \nthat Massachusetts provides the Agency special duty to \nconsider preemption under EPCA in a joint rulemaking \naction in reviewing waiver requests. In Massachusetts, \nthe Supreme Court recognized the potential overlap \n401.\u2002   Section 209(b)(2) provides that if each State [California] \nstandard is at least as stringent as comparable applicable Federal \nstandards then such standard shall be deemed to be as protective \nof public health and welfare as such federal standards for purposes \nof section 209(b)(1)(A). EPA acknowledges that in 1977 Congress \namended the waiver provision to allow for California to address its \nunique combination of air quality problems and that California only \nbe required to demonstrate stringency in the aggregate and that \ntherefore some pollutant standards may not be as stringent. \n402.\u2002  84 FR at 51338 (\u201cEPA agrees with commenters that EPA \nis not the agency that Congress has tasked with administering \nand interpreting EPCA. This is especially so because \u2018[t]he \nwaiver proceeding produces a forum ill-suited to the resolution of \nconstitutional claims.\u2019 MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115.\u201d). \n403.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d at 463. \n\n250a\nbetween NHTSA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s statutory obligations and \nconcluded that \u201cthere is no reason to think the two \nagencies cannot both administer their obligations yet \navoid inconsistency.\u201d404 As one commenter noted, EPA \nand NHTSA have previously engaged in joint actions \nthat addressed fuel economy and GHG emissions. In \nthose actions, NHTSA\u2019s role has been to set national fuel \neconomy standards and EPA\u2019s role has been to set national \nGHG standards.405 These roles are complementary, but \ndistinct. The Court acknowledged the independence of \nthese roles in Massachusetts: \u201cEPA has been charged with \nprotecting the public\u2019s \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018welfare,\u2019 42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1), a statutory obligation wholly independent of \nDOT\u2019s mandate to promote energy efficiency. See Energy \nPolicy and Conservation Act, \u00a72(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U.S.C. \n6201(5).\u201d406 \nRegarding the Agency\u2019s simultaneous pronouncement \nthat reliance on preemption under EPCA would be a \nsingular exercise that would not be repeated, statutory \nsupport or past precedent for this singular consideration \nwas also lacking.407 In fact, this singular exercise would \n404.\u2002  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 532 (2007). \n405.\u2002  In its most recent rulemaking addressing GHG emissions \nfrom light-duty vehicles, EPA extensively coordinated with NHTSA \non details of the program but did not conduct it as a joint rulemaking. \nSee 86 FR 74434, 74436 (December 30, 2021). \n406.\u2002  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 497, 532. \n407.\u2002  \u201cEPA does not intend in future waiver proceedings \nconcerning submissions of California programs in other subject areas \nto consider factors outside the statutory criteria in section 209(b)(1)\n(A)-(C).\u201d 84 FR at 51338. \n\n251a\nallow for EPA to evaluate the same waiver request \ndifferently and depending on EPA\u2019s own choice\u2014the \nchoice to act with another agency or not\u2014rather than on \nthe merits of the waiver request itself within specified \ncriteria in section 209(b). Again, the result of this unique \napplication of EPA\u2019s authority is unsupported under \nsection 209(b)(1). \nAs previously noted, EPCA is generally administered \nby NHTSA and consideration of preemption under EPCA \nin reviewing waiver requests would for instance call for \nEPA to resolve the much debated and differing views as \nto what is a \u201claw or regulation related to fuel economy,\u201d \nas contemplated by 39 U.S.C. 32919(a).408 Relevant judicial \nprecedent would also appear to call into question whether \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV sales mandates \nare indeed preempted under EPCA.409 But as previously \nexplained, EPA does not implement EPCA, and the \nAgency\u2019s review of waiver requests is highly deferential. \nEPA also disagrees with comments that the Agency \nmust generally consider factors outside the criteria listed \nin section 209(b), including preemption under EPCA, \nregardless of the joint- or single-agency nature of the \naction. EPA has never claimed that it has such broad \nauthority to consider factors outside section 209(b) and the \n408.\u2002  EPA takes no position on any role NHTSA might play \nunder 42 U.S.C. 32919(a) and acknowledges that NHTSA discusses \nthis in its recent final rulemaking. See generally 86 FR 74236. \n409.\u2002  See, e.g., Cent. Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. v. Goldstene, \n529 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1153-54 (E.D. Cal. 2007), as corrected Mar. 26, \n2008; Green Mountain Chrysler Plymouth Dodge Jeep v. Crombie, \n508 F. Supp. 2d 295, 300-01 (D. Vt. 2007). \n\n252a\ndecades of waiver practice, as well as judicial precedent, \nare indicative of the Agency\u2019s narrow scope of review \nfor California waiver requests: \u201c[T]he Administrator \nhas consistently held since first vested with the waiver \nauthority, [that] his inquiry under section 209 is modest \nin scope. He has no \u2018broad and impressive\u2019 authority \nto modify California regulations.\u201d410 Instead, EPA has \nconsistently declined to consider factors outside the \nthree statutory criteria listed in section 209(b).411 This \nlimited scope of review has been repeatedly upheld by \nthe courts. For example, in MEMA I, the D.C. Circuit \nstated that \u201cthere is no such thing as a \u201cgeneral duty\u201d \non an administrative agency to make decisions based on \nfactors other than those Congress expressly or impliedly \nintended the agency to consider.\u201d412 In MEMA II, the D.C. \nCircuit again rejected consideration of a factor outside the \n209(b) statutory criteria because doing so would restrict \nCalifornia\u2019s ability to \u201cexercise broad discretion.\u201d413 \n410.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n411.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (rejecting objections to the \nprocedures at state level, objections that section 207(c)(3)(A) \nestablishes field protection, and constitutional objections all as \nbeyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review); 74 FR at \n32783 (declining to consider EPCA preemption, stating that \u201csection \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act limits our authority to deny California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers to the three criteria therein.\u201d); 79 FR at 46264 \n(reiterating that EPA can only deny a waiver request based on \nthe 209(b) statutory criteria, dismissing comments on preemption \nunder EPCA, as well as the Constitution and the implications of the \nFAAAA). \n412.\u2002  627 F.2d at 1116. \n413.\u2002  142 F.3d at 464. \n\n253a\nCommenters also claim that ignoring NHTSA\u2019s \nfinding of preemption would violate the Supremacy Clause \nof the Constitution because the necessary consequence of \nNHTSA\u2019s conclusion in SAFE 1 is that certain standards \nwere void ab initio as preempted under EPCA and as such \nthat \u201cthe state mandates referenced in [California\u2019s] petition \nfor reconsideration are not even eligible to be considered \nfor a CAA waiver of preemption.\u201d414 EPA disagrees. As \nthe D.C. Circuit has held, \u201c[t]hat [the Administrator] like \nevery other administrative officer owes allegiance to the \nConstitution does not mean that he is required to issue \nrulings of constitutional dimension.\u201d415 Thus, \u201c[n]othing in \nsection 209 requires [the Administrator] to consider the \nconstitutional ramifications of the regulations for which \nCalifornia requests a waiver.\u201d416 \nMoreover, consideration of factors beyond those set \nout in section 209(b)(1) would subject California and vehicle \nand engine manufacturers to changes in regulatory \nschemes by other federal agencies not acting under the \nauthority of the CAA.417 SAFE 1 and subsequent events \n414.\u2002  NADA at 3. \n415.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1114-15. \n416.\u2002  Id. at 1115. \n417.\u2002  \u201cThe manufacture of automobiles is a complex matter, \nrequiring decisions to be made far in advance of their actual \nexecution.

Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., \nat 730 1st Sess. (1967). \n\n254a\nperfectly encapsulate this problem. For instance, NHTSA \nhas since finalized the repeal of the regulatory provisions \nand pronouncements it made in SAFE 1 that were the \nunderpinnings for EPA withdrawing certain aspects of the \nACC program waiver and with that action the Agency\u2019s \nbasis for revocation of the waiver under EPCA has now \nevanesced.418 Additionally, this is affirmation of EPA\u2019s long \nheld view that waiver proceedings are not the appropriate \nvenue for resolving these issues, and the joint-rulemaking \ncontext is not and should never have been justification \nfor deviating from statutory authority and the Agency\u2019s \nhistorical practice. \nIt also bears note that consideration of factors beyond \nthe criteria contained in section 209(b) would not be limited \nto preemption under EPCA. Commenters suggested, \nfor instance, that EPA would not be able to \u201cignore the \nFirst Amendment,\u201d in the hypothetical situation where \nCalifornia impos[ed] standards on some manufacturers \nin retaliation for their voiced opposition to California\u2019s \nauthority as well as criminality such as \u201cbribery and \nextortion had been instrumental in assembling the \nlegislative majorities.\u201d419 In short, under the commenter\u2019s \nview, factors for consideration in waiver proceedings would \nbe innumerable. And yet these factors bear little or no \nrelation to specific criteria in section 209(b) that would \notherwise warrant the denial of a waiver request. The D.C. \nCircuit has already, several times, held that EPA is not \nrequired to consider factors outside of and unconnected \n418.\u2002  See 86 FR 74236. \n419.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n\n255a\nto these statutory criteria, especially constitutional \nobjections. In fact, regarding the commenter\u2019s example, \nthe court has already specifically rejected consideration of \nthe First Amendment in waiver evaluations. In MEMA I, \nthe court considered and upheld EPA\u2019s decision declining \nto consider a First Amendment objection to a waiver as \nbeyond the scope of agency review.420 Courts have also \nrejected objections based on the applicability of CAA \nsection 207 to California waiver requests421 and the \nCommerce Clause.422 EPA is therefore not persuaded \nby these arguments. Additionally, courts have long held \nthat administrative proceedings for California waiver \nrequests are ill-suited for consideration of constitutional \nissues. Nothing precludes commenters from challenging \nCalifornia\u2019s standards themselves\u2014whether under EPCA, \nanother statute, or the Constitution\u2014in other, better-\nsuited fora. According to the D.C. Circuit, for instance, \n[w]hile nothing in section 209 categorically forbids the \nAdministrator from listening to constitutionality-based \nchallenges, petitioners are assured through a petition of \nreview . . . that their contentions will get a hearing.\u201d423 The \nD.C. Circuit has also repeatedly stated that challenges \n420.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n421.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d 449, 467 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n422.\u2002  ATA v.

Cir. 2015) (rejecting a challenge for lack of jurisdiction \nbecause challengers objected to California\u2019s regulations themselves, \nnot EPA\u2019s approval of them in a waiver under 209(b)). \n423.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115. \n\n256a\nwhich go to the legality of California\u2019s standards \nthemselves, are better addressed directly by either \ncourts or Congress.424 Challenges based on preemption \nunder EPCA similarly go to the legality of California\u2019s \nstandards themselves and are thus more appropriate in \ncourt or addressed to Congress. \nE.\t Conclusion\nBecause the landscape of federal law has changed \nsince SAFE 1 due to NHTSA\u2019s repeal of its regulatory \ntext, appendix, and pronouncements regarding EPCA \npreemption in SAFE 1, EPA believes that it is appropriate \nto rescind its waiver withdrawal actions in SAFE 1 that \nwere predicated on the federal law context created by \nNHTSA\u2019s SAFE 1 action. On separate grounds, EPA also \nbelieves that, based on the foregoing, EPA should not have \ndeviated from its practice of limiting its waiver review \nto the criteria in section 209(b)(1). Thus, for the reasons \nstated above, EPA is rescinding those portions of SAFE \n1 that withdrew the waiver of the ACC program on the \nbasis of preemption under EPCA. \n424.\u2002  Id. at 1105. In ATA v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit rejected \na constitutional challenge to a California waiver, concluding that \nCongress made the decision to give California \u201cthe primary role \nin regulating certain mobile pollution sources\u201d so the challenger\u2019s \nargument was best directed to Congress. 600 F.3d 624, 628 (D.C. \nCir. 2010). \n\n257a\nVII.\tEPA Inappropriately Set Forth an Interpretive \nView of Section 177 in SAFE 1\nIn SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive view of \nsection 177 of the CAA, stating that states adopting \nCalifornia\u2019s new motor vehicle emission standards \n(section 177 states) could not adopt California\u2019s GHG \nstandards.425 In this action, EPA determines that it was \nboth inappropriate and unnecessary within a waiver \nproceeding to provide an interpretive view of the authority \nof section 177 states to adopt California standards, as EPA \nplays no statutory approval role in connection with states\u2019 \nadoption of standards identical to those standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted to California.426 Rather, \nif a state chooses to submit such standards for inclusion \nin an SIP, EPA\u2019s role with regard to approval of these \nstandards is to review them in the same way that EPA \nreviews all SIP revisions a state submits, via a notice and \ncomment process, to ensure that the submission meets \nall statutory and regulatory requirements as part of \nthe Agency\u2019s decision whether to approve or disapprove \nthe submission. Therefore, the Agency is rescinding the \ninterpretive views on section 177 set out in SAFE 1. \n425.\u2002  84 FR at 51310, 51350. \n426.\u2002  EPA is aware of instances of States adopting California \nnew motor vehicle emission standards and not subsequently including \nsuch standards in their SIP. In these circumstances EPA has not \nplayed and would not play an approval role. \n\n258a\nA.\t SAFE 1 Interpretation\nIn the SAFE proposal, EPA proposed to conclude that \n\u201cStates may not adopt California\u2019s GHG standards pursuant \nto section 177 because the text, context, and purpose of \nsection 177 support the conclusion that this provision \nis limited to providing States the ability, under certain \ncircumstances and with certain conditions, to adopt and \nenforce standards designed to control criteria pollutants \nto address NAAQS nonattainment.\u201d427 Additionally, the \nproposal noted the title of section 177 (\u201cNew motor vehicle \nemission standards in nonattainment areas\u201d) indicates a \nlimited scope of application.428 The proposal also suggested \nthat, because \u201c[a]reas are only designated nonattainment \nwith respect to criteria pollutants,\u201d it would be \u201cillogical\u201d \nif states could use their 177 authority \u201cto adopt California \nstandards that addressed environmental problems other \nthan nonattainment of criteria pollutant standards.\u201d429 \nIn the SAFE 1 decision, EPA finalized its proposed \ninterpretive view, reiterating that \u201cthe text (including \nboth the title and main text), structural location, and \npurpose of the provision confirm that it does not apply to \nGHG standards.\u201d430 Because section 177\u2019s title references \nnonattainment areas, and because nonattainment \ndesignations only exist for criteria pollutants, EPA \n427.\u2002  83 FR at 43240. \n428.\u2002  Id. \n429.\u2002  Id. \n430.\u2002  84 FR at 51350. \n\n259a\nclaimed, states could not adopt standards for purposes \nof GHG control under section 177.431 \nAs evidence for this interpretive view, EPA again \npointed to the text and location of the section, which \nhad been the basis for the Agency\u2019s interpretation in the \nSAFE proposal. EPA acknowledged commenters who \nargued that \u201cCAA section 177 does not contain any text \nthat could be read as limiting its applicability to certain \npollutants only\u201d and that EPA had \u201cinappropriately relied \non the heading for CAA section 177 to construe a statutory \nprovision as well as arrogated authority to implement an \notherwise self-implementing provision,\u201d but disagreed \nwith these commenters.432 In addition to the evidence \nrelied on in the proposal, EPA provided examples of \nlegislative history from the 1977 amendments to support \nits interpretive view.433 \n431.\u2002  Id. \n432.\u2002  Id. \n433.\u2002  In particular, EPA cited legislative history on section \n172(b), which set forth the \u201crequisite provisions\u201d for state plans for \nnonattainment areas.

In these circumstances EPA has not \nplayed and would not play an approval role. \n451.\u2002  EPA notes that although section 177 states that \u201c. . . any \nState which has plan provisions approved under this part may adopt \nand enforce for any model year standards relating to control of \nemissions from new motor vehicles . . .\u201d the language in section 177 \ndoes not require a state to submit its adopted motor vehicle emissions \nstandards for SIP approval. \n\n266a\n177 in the context of that action. EPA believes it acted \ninappropriately in providing an interpretive view in \nSAFE 1 and that such action was based on an inaccurate \nassessment of the factual record. EPA\u2019s interpretive view \nwas not compelled by any petition, request, or legislative \nor judicial mandate and was otherwise not final agency \naction.452 EPA is therefore rescinding the interpretive \nviews contained in SAFE 1. \nAs commenters have noted, section 177 does not \ndescribe a direct approval role for EPA. Section 177 says \nthat \u201cany State which has plan provisions approved under \nthis part may adopt and enforce\u201d identical California \nstandards and delineates three specific criteria for \nadoption.453 Nothing in this language or in the text of the \nrest of the section requires or allows EPA to approve such \nadoption and enforcement or directs EPA to implement \nthe section through regulation; EPA plays no statutory \napproval role in the adoption of California standards by \nother states other than action on a SIP revision, should \nthose states include the standards in their plans. In \nfact, there are only three prerequisites to adoption and \nenforcement by a state: That the state has a federally \napproved SIP, that the standards are identical (thus the \n452.\u2002  84 FR at 51338 n.256 (\u201cEPA acknowledges that its \nactions in this document may have implications for certain prior and \npotential future EPA reviews of and actions on state SIPs. . . .

EPA, 606 F.2d \n1293, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Similarly, in 1994, while enacting rules \nimplementing section 209(e)(2)(B), the parallel provision for the \nnonroad vehicle section of the California Waiver program, EPA \nnoted that section 177 states had not \u201cask[ed] for EPA authorization \nbefore they adopted the California standards, nor did EPA or the \nautomobile industry suggest that they needed such authorization.\u201d \n56 FR 36969, 36983 (1994). See also 77 FR 62637 n.54 (\u201cStates are \nnot required to seek EPA approval under the terms of section 177.\u201d). \n456.\u2002  EPA also notes that there are ample judicial avenues \nto directly challenge state adoption of California standards. For \nexample, the First and Second Circuits have already addressed \nobjections to the adoption of California standards under section 177. \nIn both Am. Auto. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Mass. DEP and Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n v. NYSDEC, petitioners argued that the States\u2019 adoption of \nCalifornia\u2019s low emission vehicles standards without the associated \nclean fuels plan violated section 177. 31 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 1994); 17 \nF.3d 521 (2d Cir. 1994). \n\n268a\nSIP revision that includes that adopted standard. In that \nproceeding, EPA could determine whether the statutory \ncriteria for adoption are met for purposes of approving a \nSIP revision. Indeed, in the litigation following SAFE 1, \nEPA acknowledged that its interpretive view of section \n177 would have no actual effect until applied in a future \nSIP context. 457 SIPs are a crucial planning tool in helping \nstates reach attainment for NAAQS and California\u2019s \nstandards are key components of many of these SIPs.458 \nIn a SIP proceeding, these states and other stakeholders \nare better able to provide specific and comprehensive \n457.\u2002  Several commenters on the Notice of Reconsideration \nargued that SAFE 1 violated conformity rules by interfering \nwith already approved SIPs.

Therefore, EPA \nwithdraws its interpretive views that had been set forth \nin SAFE 1.\nVIII.\t Other Issues\nA.\t Equal Sovereignty\nAs explained in Section VI, EPA must grant \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request unless the Agency makes \none of the specified findings in section 209(b)(1). In this \n459.\u2002  The Agency has considered whether there may be any \nreliance interests on EPA\u2019s previous interpretive view of section \n177 described in the SAFE 1 action. EPA is unaware of any such \ninterests, and none were raised in comments. \n460.\u2002  To the extent that EPA\u2019s reasoning in its SAFE 1 section \n177 determination lacked fair notice, as the States and Cities\u2019 Petition \nclaimed, such a contention is rendered moot by this action. \n\n270a\ninstance, Congress has made multiple determinations \nthrough its adoption of section 209 and subsequent \namendments, dating from 1967 through the 1990 CAA \nAmendments, regarding California\u2019s role and its relation \nto federal standard setting for mobile sources. EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding waiver practice, consistent with case law, \nhas been to refrain from considering factors beyond \nsection 209(b)(1) criteria as well as constitutional claims \nin the review of California waiver requests.461 EPA \nacknowledges that California adopts its standards \nas a matter of law under its police powers,462 that the \nAgency\u2019s task in reviewing waiver requests is properly \nlimited to evaluating California\u2019s request according to \n461.\u2002  EPA has declined to consider constitutional challenges to \nCalifornia Waivers since at least 1976. 41 FR 44212 (Oct. 7, 1976) (\u201cAn \nadditional argument against granting the waiver was raised by the \nMotorcycle Industry Council and Yamaha, who contended that the \nCARB had violated due process when adopting their standards, by \nnot allowing the manufacturers a fair and full opportunity to present \ntheir views at a State hearing. If this argument has any validity, \nthe EPA waiver hearing is not the proper forum in which to raise it. \nSection 209(b) does not require that EPA insist on any particular \nprocedures at the State level. Furthermore, a complete opportunity \nwas provided at the EPA waiver hearing for the presentation of \nviews.\u201d). See also, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (July 25, 1978) (rejecting \nobjections to the procedures at state level, objections that section \n207(c)(3)(A) establishes field protection, and constitutional objections \nall as beyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review). \n462.\u2002  Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. v. Goldstene, 529 \nF.Supp.2d 1151, 1174 (\u201cThe waiver provision of the Clean Air Act \nrecognizes that California has exercised its police power to regulate \npollution emissions from motor vehicles since before March 30, 1966; \na date that predates both the Clean Air Act and EPCA.\u201d). \n\n271a\nthe criteria in section 209(b), and that it is appropriate \nto defer to litigation brought by third parties in other \ncourts, such as state or federal court, for the resolution \nof constitutionality claims and inconsistency, if any, with \nother statutes. As further explained this practice flows \nfrom the statute and legislative history, which reflect a \nbroad policy deference that is afforded to California to \naddress its serious air quality problems (which are on-\ngoing) as well as to drive emission control innovation. And \nso, EPA has historically declined to consider constitutional \nissues in evaluating and granting section 209 waivers. In \nMEMA I, the D.C. Circuit rejected a First Amendment \nchallenge to a waiver as outside the scope of review.463 In \n2009, EPA approved a waiver (and authorization) under \nsection 209(e), granting California authority to enforce \nits Airborne Toxic Control Measure, which established \nin-use emission performance standards for engines in \ntransport refrigeration units (TRUs) and TRU generator \nsets.464 Responding to comments that the waiver reached \nbeyond California\u2019s borders in violation of the Dormant \nCommerce Clause, EPA stated that such considerations \nare not factors that EPA must consider under section \n209(e) because \u201cEPA\u2019s review of California\u2019s regulations \nis limited to the criteria that Congress directed EPA to \nreview.\u201d465 This interpretation was upheld by the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals.

As the D.C. \nCircuit reasoned in MEMA I, \u201cit is generally considered \nthat the constitutionality of Congressional enactments \nis beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d472 \nAlthough commenters here raise a new constitutional \nargument\u2014that of Equal Sovereignty rather than the \n470.\u2002  States and Cities at 41-42. \n471.\u2002  78 FR at 2145. \n472.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1114-15 (D.C.

As in the 2013 ACC program \nwaiver, the decision on whether to grant the waiver and the \nconsequence of a reinstated waiver is based solely on the \ncriteria in section 209(b) and this decision does not attempt \nto interpret or apply the Equal Sovereignty Doctrine or \nany other constitutional or statutory provision.\nB.\t CARB\u2019s Deemed-To-Comply Provision\nEPA received comments arguing that California\u2019s 2018 \nclarification to its deemed-to-comply provision \u201cchanged \nimportant underlying requirements of the original 2012 \nwaiver application\u201d and \u201cEPA cannot reinstate a Clean Air \nAct waiver for a program that no longer exists.\u201d475 These \ncommenters maintain that California has never sought a \nwaiver for the 2018 amendments or a determination that \nthe change is within the scope of the prior waiver. As \nsuch, commenters maintain that EPA lacks a necessary \npredicate to permit California\u2019s enforcement of its \namended GHG standards. \nOther commenters argued that the \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d \nprovision was always conditioned on the federal standards \n475.\u2002  AFPM at 7; Urban Air at 2, 18-19; NADA at 6. \n\n277a\nproviding GHG reductions that were at least equal to or \nas protective as California\u2019s program and so the 2018 \namendments did not substantively change the provision \nor affect any related reliance interests and instead were \ndesigned to clarify the provision.476 Commenters maintain \nthat CARB adopted \u201cnon-substantive amendments for its \nLEV III regulations to further clarify that the deemed-\nto-comply provision would only apply if the federal GHG \nstandards remained substantially as they were as of the \ndate of the 2017 Final Determination.\u201d477 According to \nthese commenters, California adopted these amendments \nafter EPA\u2019s withdrawal of its 2017 Final Determination \nthat had determined that its Federal GHG standards for \nmodel years 2022-2025 remained appropriate and instead \nconcluded that the federal standards for model years \n2022-2025 may be too stringent and should be revised. \nEPA notes that after the January 2017 MTE CARB \nsubsequently found that compliance with those federal \nstandards would result in equivalent or greater GHG \nbenefits than originally projected for California.478 These \ncommenters further maintain that the clarification of the \n476.\u2002  States and Cities at 58-61. (\u201cCalifornia always intended \nits standards would \u2018remain an important backstop in the event the \nnational program is weakened or terminated.\u2019 78 FR at 2,128.\u201d). \n477.\u2002  Id. at 60. \u201cFinal Determination on the Appropriateness \nof the Model Year 2022-2025 Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse \nGas Emissions Standards under the Midterm Evaluation\u201d (2017 \nFinal Determination) at https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.\ncgi?Dockey=P100QQ91.pdf. \n478.\u2002  82 FR 14671 (March 22, 2017) and 83 FR 16077 (April \n13, 2018). \n\n278a\ndeemed-to-comply provision is immaterial to the reversal \nof the waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1 because the SAFE \n1 action was expressly based on EPA\u2019s decision to rely on \nNHTSA\u2019s preemption findings and section 209(b)(1)(B) \ndetermination, neither of which was based on CARB\u2019s \n2018 clarification rulemaking. As such, the commenters \nmaintain that the clarification of the deemed-to-comply \nprovision has no bearing on and does not preclude EPA\u2019s \nSAFE 1 waiver withdrawal.479 \nAs previously explained, under section 209(b)(1) EPA \nis to grant a waiver of preemption for California to enforce \nits own standards that would otherwise be preempted \nunder section 209(a). This preemption does not extend to \nfederal standards that are adopted under section 202(a). \nEPA explained this in responding to comments on the \ndeemed-to-comply provision in the ACC program waiver \ndecision. \u201c[T]he waiver decision affects only California\u2019s \nemission standards, not the federal standards that exist \nregardless of EPA\u2019s decision.\u201d480 This preemptive effect \nof section 209(a) does not change even when California \nchooses to allow for compliance with its standards through \nfederal standards as envisaged by the deemed-to-comply \nprovision. \nIt also bears note that in SAFE 1, EPA made clear \nthat the 2018 amendment was not a \u201cnecessary part of \nthe basis for the waiver withdrawal and other actions that \n479.\u2002  States and Cities at 60-62. \n480.\u2002  78 FR at 2124. \n\n279a\nEPA finalizes in this [SAFE1] document.481 In the Notice of \nReconsideration, EPA neither reopened nor reconsidered \nelements of the 2013 waiver that were not part of EPA\u2019s \nfindings in SAFE 1.482 As noted in this decision, EPA \nhas evaluated the factual and legal errors that occurred \nin SAFE 1. As part of this evaluation, EPA believes it \nhas considered all appropriate and relevant information \nnecessary to its review of issues associated with the \nsecond waiver prong or consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA. The Agency also recognizes that it received \ncomments from parties that raised non-germane issues to \nEPA\u2019s Notice of Reconsideration. EPA did not conduct an \nanalysis of such comments in the context of reconsidering \nthe specific actions taken in SAFE 1. EPA also makes \nclear that the result of rescinding its part of SAFE 1 is \n481.\u2002  EPA declined to \u201ctake any position at this point on what \neffect California\u2019s December 2018 amendment to its \u201cdeemed to \ncomply\u2019 provision . . . [may] have on the continued validity of the \nJanuary 2013 waiver.\u201d 84 FR at 51329, n.208, 51334, n.230. Although \nEPA claimed in SAFE 1 that the deemed to comply clarification \nconfirmed and provided further support for the SAFE 1 action, \nEPA no longer makes this claim to the extent it is relevant in its \nreconsideration and rescission of SAFE 1. The consequence of this \naction is the reinstatement of the ACC program waiver issued in 2013 \nand does not extend to other regulatory developments in California \nor by EPA that occurred subsequent to that waiver decision. \n482.\u2002  86 FR at 22423. In addition to declining to take a position \non the effect of California\u2019s 2018 amendments to its \u201cdeemed to \ncomply\u201d provision, SAFE 1 did not finalize the withdrawal of the \nwaiver under the first or third waiver prongs. EPA also notes that \nit has previously responded twice to the comments suggesting that \nCARB\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision demonstrates that California \ndoes not have a need for its own standards. See 78 FR at 2124-25. \n\n280a\nthe automatic reinstatement of the waiver granted to \nCalifornia in 2013 for its ACC program. That is the result \nof the action taken herein.483\nIX.\tDecision\nAfter review of the information submitted by CARB \nand other public commenters, the SAFE 1 action, and the \nrecord pertaining to EPA\u2019s 2013 ACC program waiver, I \nfind that EPA did not appropriately exercise its limited \ninherent authority to reconsider waiver grants in SAFE \n1. SAFE 1 did not correct a clerical or factual error, nor \ndid the factual circumstances and conditions related to the \nthree statutory criteria change prior to SAFE 1, much \nless change so significantly as to cast the propriety of the \nwaiver grant into doubt. On this basis, I am rescinding \nthe SAFE 1 action.\n483.\u2002  EPA acknowledges that motor vehicle emission standards \nin California as well as federally are periodically clarified, amended, \nor revised. For example, after California issued its first deemed-to-\ncomply regulation, EPA determined that the state\u2019s GHG standards \nwere within the scope of the 2009 waiver. While EPA believes that \nCongress intended regulatory certainty to be attached to the \nAgency\u2019s waivers issued under section 209, EPA acknowledges that \nconditions may change over time so significantly that it could merit a \nreview of California\u2019s motor vehicle emission program and applicable \nstandards therein or that would prompt California to submit a \nrelated waiver request to EPA. As explained in this decision, the \nconditions associated with the analysis of the three waiver criteria \nperformed in the ACC waiver decision did not change so as to merit \nthe SAFE 1 action. EPA recognizes that federal light-duty vehicle \nGHG emission standards have been modified twice since SAFE 1 \nwas issued; the current standards do not change EPA\u2019s conclusion \nthat SAFE 1 should be rescinded. \n\n281a\nFurthermore, after review of both the 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver record as well as the SAFE 1 record, \nto the extent that EPA did have authority to reconsider \nthe ACC program waiver, I have determined that the \nasserted bases were in error and did not justify the \nwaiver withdrawal. With respect to the Agency\u2019s first \npurported basis\u2014its discretionary decision to undertake \na reinterpretation of the second waiver prong\u2014I find \nthat the statutory interpretation adopted in SAFE 1 \nis a flawed reading of the statute, and I hereby return \nto the traditional interpretation of the second waiver \nprong, which is, at least, the better interpretation. \nUnder the traditional interpretation, which looks at the \nprogram as a whole, California clearly had a compelling \nneed for the ACC program. Even if SAFE 1\u2019s statutory \nreinterpretation, which focuses on California\u2019s compelling \nneed for the specific standards, were an appropriate \nreading, EPA did not perform a reasonable, accurate, \nand complete review of the factual record in its findings \nregarding the criteria emission benefits of CARB\u2019s ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG emission regulations. Upon \nreview, I find that SAFE 1\u2019s predicate for concluding \nthat California did not have a compelling need for these \nspecific standards was not reasonable given the record \nat the time of the ACC program waiver and once again \nduring the SAFE 1 proceeding. A reasonable, accurate, \nand complete review of the record supports the need for \nCalifornia\u2019s specific GHG emission standards and ZEV \nsales mandate to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California. This is true whether I look at \nhow these standards reduce criteria pollution, GHG \npollution, or both. In sum, although I am not adopting \n\n282a\nthe interpretation of the second waiver prong set forth \nin SAFE 1, I find that the burden of proof necessary to \ndemonstrate that CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate and GHG \nemission standards are not needed to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions has not been met under either \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong. Therefore, I \nrescind the Agency\u2019s part of the SAFE 1 action to the \nextent it relied upon the second waiver prong to withdraw \nthe ACC program waiver. \nWith regard to the applicability of preemption under \nEPCA, I find that, to the extent EPA\u2019s authority to \nreconsider the ACC program waiver rested upon NHTSA\u2019s \njoint action at the time as well as the applicability of its \nEPCA interpretation to EPA\u2019s review, this statute falls \nclearly outside the confines of section 209(b) where EPA\u2019s \nauthority to grant, deny, and reconsider waivers resides. \nIn any event, the grounds for such action under SAFE \n1 no longer exist given NHTSA\u2019s recent final action \nwithdrawing its EPCA preemption rule in its entirety.\nEach of the decisions and justifications contained in \nthis final action is severable.\nThis decision rescinds EPA\u2019s SAFE 1 action and \ntherefore, as a result, the waiver of preemption EPA \ngranted to California for its ACC program ZEV sales \nmandates and GHG emission standards issued in 2013, \nincluding for the 2017 through 2025 model years, comes \nback into force.\n\n283a\nJudicial Review\nSection 307(b)(1) of the CAA governs judicial review \nof final actions by EPA. This section provides, in part, \nthat petitions for review must be filed in the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: (i) When \nthe agency action consists of \u201cnationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final actions taken, by \nthe Administrator,\u201d or (ii) when such action is locally \nor regionally applicable, but \u201csuch action is based on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect and if in \ntaking such action the Administrator finds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d For \nlocally or regionally applicable final actions, the CAA \nreserves to EPA complete discretion whether to invoke \nthe exception in (ii).\nThis final action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within \nthe meaning of section 307(b)(1). In the alternative, \nto the extent a court finds this action to be locally or \nregionally applicable, the Administrator is exercising \nthe complete discretion afforded to him under the CAA \nto make and publish a finding that this action is based on \na determination of \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d within \nthe meaning of section 307(b)(1).484 This action rescinds \nEPA\u2019s final action in SAFE 1, which withdrew a waiver \n484.\u2002  In deciding whether to invoke the exception by making and \npublishing a finding that this final action is based on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect, the Administrator has also taken into \naccount a number of policy considerations, including his judgment \nbalancing the benefit of obtaining the D.C. Circuit\u2019s authoritative \ncentralized review versus allowing development of the issue in other \ncontexts and the best use of agency resources. \n\n284a\nfor new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards \nand ZEV sales mandate granted to California under \nsection 209(b) of the CAA. In addition to California, \nsixteen other states and the District of Columbia have \nalready adopted California\u2019s motor vehicle greenhouse gas \nstandards. The other states are New York, Massachusetts, \nVermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode \nIsland, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, New Jersey, \nNevada, Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, and Delaware.485 \nThese jurisdictions represent a wide geographic area \nand fall within eight different judicial circuits.486 In \naddition, this action will affect manufacturers nationwide \nwho produce vehicles to meet the emissions standards \nof these states. For these reasons, this final action is \nnationally applicable or, alternatively, the Administrator is \nexercising the complete discretion afforded to him by the \nCAA and hereby finds that this final action is based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect for purposes \nof section 307(b)(1) and is hereby publishing that finding \nin the Federal Register . \nUnder CAA section 307(b)(1), petitions for judicial \nreview of this action must be filed in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n485.\u2002  The same states have adopted California\u2019s ZEV sales \nmandate regulation with the exception of Pennsylvania, Washington, \nand Delaware. \n486.\u2002  In the report on the 1977 Amendments that revised \nCAA section 307(b)(1), Congress noted that the Administrator\u2019s \ndetermination that the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d exception applies \nwould be appropriate for any action that has a scope or effect beyond \na single judicial circuit.

I now understand that the central legal question is whether the petitioners (fuel producers) have Article III standing to challenge the EPA's waiver for California's clean car regulations.\n\nThe specific element of standing at issue is \"redressability.\" The petitioners must demonstrate that their alleged injury\u2014lost gasoline sales due to an increase in electric vehicles\u2014would likely be remedied by a favorable court decision that vacates the EPA waiver.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case for lack of standing, reasoning that the injury was not redressable. The court's finding was based on the premise that independent factors, separate from the EPA waiver, are driving the auto market's shift toward electric vehicles. These factors include:\n1.  **Market Forces:** Growing consumer demand for electric vehicles.\n2.  **Voluntary Agreements:** Several major automakers (e.g., Honda, Ford, BMW) have voluntarily committed to meeting California's standards, irrespective of the federal waiver, due to prior investments and market trends.\n\nTherefore, the lower court concluded that even if it invalidated the EPA waiver, these other factors would persist, the market would continue its shift to EVs, and the fuel producers' injury would not be redressed. This establishes the critical point of contention for the Supreme Court. To predict the outcome, I must focus on the petitioners' arguments that the D.C. Circuit erred and that the EPA waiver is a significant, independent cause of their injury, the removal of which would provide a tangible remedy.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be centered on the Article III standing question, specifically the element of redressability. Previously, I understood that the D.C. Circuit dismissed the case because it believed the fuel producers' injury (lost sales) was not redressable. The lower court reasoned that even if the EPA waiver were vacated, independent factors like market demand for EVs and voluntary automaker commitments to California's standards would persist, meaning the shift away from gasoline would continue regardless.\n\nThe new observation, the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, has significantly refined my understanding by providing the petitioners' direct legal arguments against the D.C. Circuit's decision. My beliefs are now updated as follows:\n\n1.  **The Petitioners' Core Standing Argument:** The petitioners frame the key legal question as \"Whether a party may establish the redressability component of Article III standing by relying on the coercive and predictable effects of regulation on third parties.\" They argue that the D.C. Circuit erred by requiring specific, direct evidence (like affidavits from automakers) showing exactly how third parties would react to the waiver's vacatur.\n    *   **Reliance on Precedent:** They contend that Supreme Court precedent supports a more practical approach to redressability in cases of indirect injury. They cite *Bennett v. Spear* for the principle that \"remov[ing] a regulatory hurdle\" to the sale of a product is sufficient, and *Department of Commerce v. New York* for the idea that standing can be based on the \"predictable effect\" of a regulation on third parties.\n    *   **\"Self-Evident\" Injury and Redress:** A central pillar of their argument is that when a regulation's *express purpose* is to reduce demand for the plaintiffs' products (liquid fuels), redress is self-evident. Vacating the regulation would, at a minimum, remove a significant government-imposed market distortion, thereby providing a remedy for their injury.\n\n2.  **Allegation of a Circuit Split:** The petition asserts that the D.C. Circuit's demanding standard for redressability creates a conflict among the courts of appeals. This is a critical factor for predicting whether the Supreme Court will grant certiorari. The petitioners argue that other circuits have found standing in similar situations without the kind of direct third-party evidence the D.C. Circuit demanded.\n\n3.  **The Merits of the Case are also at Play:** The petitioners are not just asking the Court to resolve the standing issue; they are also asking it to rule on the underlying legality of the EPA's waiver. This second question presented is: \"Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate is unlawful.\"\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation of the Clean Air Act:** They argue that under Section 209(b), a waiver is only permissible for \"compelling and extraordinary conditions\" that are specific to California. They contend that global climate change is, by definition, not a localized California condition. Furthermore, they argue California does not \"need\" its own standards to \"meet\" a global condition that its individual actions cannot discernibly affect.\n    *   **Invocation of the Major Questions Doctrine:** The petitioners explicitly connect their case to the doctrine articulated in *West Virginia v. EPA*. They argue that allowing California to set de facto national energy policy through this waiver constitutes a \"major question\" of vast economic and political significance that requires a clear and unambiguous authorization from Congress, which they claim is absent from the Clean Air Act.\n\n4.  **Procedural Urgency:** The petition highlights that the challenged waiver only applies through the 2025 model year. They argue that if the Supreme Court only remands on the standing issue, the merits of the case may evade judicial review before the regulation expires, a pattern they claim has occurred previously. This adds a practical reason for the Court to grant review on both the standing and merits questions simultaneously.\n\nIn summary, my belief has evolved from understanding the D.C. Circuit's rationale for dismissal to now understanding the petitioners' multi-pronged legal strategy to overturn it. This strategy involves a direct attack on the legal standard for redressability, the creation of a circuit split, and a substantive challenge to the EPA's authority based on statutory interpretation and the Major Questions Doctrine. Predicting the outcome now requires evaluating how the current Supreme Court is likely to view these specific arguments about standing in administrative law and the scope of agency power under the Clean Air Act.",

No other action could provide more value for this specific prediction at this stage.\n\nDesign EIG is very high (0.8) because this action powerfully reinforces a fundamental and universally applicable strategy in legal prediction: always acquire the primary opposing arguments before forming a confident prediction.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.

Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.  J.A. 174; see Pet. Br. 38.  But the national market share \nof qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d between 2020 and 2022.  \nJ.A. 191.  In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.  And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case remains centered on the petitioners' multi-faceted challenge to the D.C. Circuit's dismissal, as detailed in their Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. This new observation does not introduce new external evidence but rather confirms the one-sided nature of my current knowledge and identifies the critical next piece of information required for a balanced prediction. My beliefs, therefore, remain stable but are now appended with a clear understanding of the existing information gap.\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Standing Argument (Stable Belief):** The petitioners argue that the D.C. Circuit erred by imposing an overly strict standard for the redressability component of Article III standing. They contend that precedent from cases like *Bennett v. Spear* and *Department of Commerce v. New York* supports finding standing based on the \"predictable effect\" of a regulation on third parties, without needing direct affidavits from those parties (the automakers). Their core assertion is that when a regulation's express purpose is to reduce demand for their product (gasoline), vacating that regulation provides a self-evident remedy.\n\n2.  **Alleged Circuit Split (Stable Belief):** A key component of the petitioners' strategy to secure certiorari is their claim that the D.C. Circuit's demanding redressability standard conflicts with the standards used by other circuit courts, thereby creating a circuit split that warrants the Supreme Court's intervention.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Merits Argument (Stable Belief):** The petitioners are simultaneously challenging the legality of the EPA waiver itself. They argue that global climate change is not a \"compelling and extraordinary condition\" specific to California as required by the Clean Air Act. Crucially, they invoke the Major Questions Doctrine, framing the EPA's waiver as granting California the power to set de facto national energy policy\u2014a decision of vast economic and political significance that, under the precedent of *West Virginia v. EPA*, requires explicit authorization from Congress.\n\n4.  **Procedural Urgency (Stable Belief):** The petitioners highlight that the regulations in question expire after the 2025 model year, creating pressure on the Court to address both standing and the merits in this term to avoid the case becoming moot before a final resolution.\n\n5.  **Acknowledged Information Gap (New Belief Layer):** The latest observation, an internal reasoning step, does not alter the above facts but critically refines my predictive process. It confirms that my current belief state is based solely on the petitioners' filings. To make an informed and balanced prediction, I must understand the counter-arguments from the respondent (the EPA). The single most important piece of missing evidence is the government's Brief in Opposition. This document will directly address the petitioners' claims regarding redressability, the existence of a circuit split, the interpretation of the Clean Air Act, and the applicability of the Major Questions Doctrine. My confidence in any potential outcome remains low and my model of the case is incomplete pending the analysis of the respondent's legal position.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal battleground in this case has significantly evolved. While my knowledge of the petitioners' arguments remains intact, I have now gained a comprehensive view of the counter-arguments from the State Respondents (California et al.), which directly address the petitioners' claims on standing. This observation fills a major information gap I had previously identified.\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Standing Argument (Stable Belief, Now Contextualized):** The petitioners (fuel producers) maintain that the D.C. Circuit applied an overly strict redressability standard. They argue, citing precedents like *Bennett v. Spear*, that when a regulation's purpose is to reduce demand for their product, vacating it provides a self-evident remedy, and they should not be required to produce direct evidence from the regulated third parties (automakers) to prove this.\n\n2.  **Alleged Circuit Split (Stable Belief):** Petitioners continue to assert that the D.C. Circuit's demanding standard for redressability creates a split with other circuits, which they argue is a key reason for the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Merits Argument (Stable Belief):** The petitioners' challenge to the waiver itself remains a core part of their case. They argue that climate change is not a \"compelling and extraordinary condition\" specific to California under the Clean Air Act and that the waiver violates the Major Questions Doctrine by effectively allowing California to set national energy policy, a power reserved for Congress, per *West Virginia v. EPA*.\n\n4.  **Procedural Urgency (Stable Belief):** The petitioners' point that the regulations expire after the 2025 model year, creating pressure for a swift resolution, remains a relevant factor.\n\n5.  **State Respondents' Counter-Argument on Standing (New Belief):** The State Respondents' brief directly refutes the petitioners' \"obvious\" standing claim. Their central argument is that standing is a \"heavily fact-dependent\" inquiry (*FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med.*, 2024), and the petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof. They argue that petitioners submitted **no evidence** to demonstrate that vacating the waiver reinstatement *in 2022* would likely cause automakers to alter their production and sales strategies in a way that would increase gasoline consumption and thus redress the petitioners' financial injury.\n\n6.  **The \"Independent Market Forces\" Defense (New Belief):** A crucial new fact introduced by the State Respondents is that by the time the suit was filed in 2022, automaker behavior was driven by factors independent of the California regulations. They argue that years of investment, \"internal sustainability goals,\" and powerful \"external market forces\" (i.e., strong consumer demand) were already pushing manufacturers to exceed the regulatory requirements for ZEV sales. This factual context is intended to sever the causal chain required for redressability, suggesting that even without the regulation, automakers would continue on the same path for their own economic and strategic reasons.\n\n7.  **Rebuttal of Petitioners' Legal Framework (New Belief):** The State Respondents explicitly ask the Court to reject the petitioners' proposed \"categorical rule\" for standing. They argue that such a rule, which would grant automatic standing to producers whenever a regulation implicates their product, is not supported by *Bennett v. Spear* or *Dept. of Commerce v. New York*. They contend that these precedents still require a plaintiff to meet their \"burden of showing that third parties will likely react\" to a favorable judgment in a way that provides redress, not just rely on \"unsubstantiated predictions.\"\n\n8.  **Strategic Reliance on Recent SCOTUS Precedent (New Belief):** The State Respondents heavily anchor their arguments in the Supreme Court's most recent standing jurisprudence, citing cases like *Murthy v. Missouri* (2024) and *FDA v. AHM* (2024). This is a clear signal that they believe the Court's current, more stringent approach to standing\u2014particularly regarding redressability that depends on the actions of independent third parties\u2014supports their position and undermines the petitioners' more lenient interpretation.\n\n9.  **Refined Information Gap (Updated Belief Layer):** My previous information gap regarding the respondents' position has been substantially filled by the State Respondents' brief. The primary legal clash over standing is now clear: it is a contest between the petitioners' purpose-driven theory of redressability and the respondents' evidence-based, market-realities theory. The main remaining gap is the brief from the Federal Respondents (the EPA), though their arguments are highly likely to align with those of the State Respondents. My predictive model is now far more balanced, focusing on whether the Court will prioritize the formal purpose of a regulation or the factual evidence of its real-world impact when assessing redressability.",

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.

Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.  They had built factories \nto make batteries and electric cars.

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.

In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.

Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was a meta-level reflection on the information-gathering process and did not introduce new substantive facts or legal arguments regarding the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, having been significantly shaped by the previously analyzed brief from the State Respondents. My current understanding is a consolidation of all prior information.\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Position (Stable):** The petitioners (fuel producers) maintain their core arguments.\n    *   **Standing:** They advocate for a lenient redressability standard based on the regulation's purpose, arguing the D.C. Circuit's fact-intensive requirement creates a circuit split. They rely on precedents like *Bennett v. Spear* to claim that when a rule is designed to suppress demand for their product, injury is self-evident and redress is obvious upon vacatur.\n    *   **Merits:** They argue the waiver is invalid because climate change is not a \"compelling and extraordinary condition\" specific to California under the Clean Air Act, and that the waiver violates the Major Questions Doctrine as articulated in *West Virginia v. EPA*.\n\n2.  **State Respondents' Position (Stable):** The State Respondents' brief provided a robust counter-argument that now forms a central pillar of my analysis.\n    *   **Fact-Dependent Standing:** Their primary argument is that standing is a \"heavily fact-dependent\" inquiry, citing the Supreme Court's very recent 2024 decisions in *FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med.* and *Murthy v. Missouri*.\n    *   **Failure of Proof:** They contend the petitioners submitted **zero evidence** to prove that vacating the 2022 waiver reinstatement would cause automakers to reverse course on EV production in a way that would increase gasoline sales and thereby redress the petitioners' financial injury.\n    *   **Independent Market Forces:** Crucially, they introduced the factual argument that by 2022, automaker behavior was dictated by independent economic realities\u2014massive prior investments, internal sustainability goals, and powerful consumer demand for EVs. This factual context is intended to sever the causal chain required for redressability, making the regulation's status moot to the automakers' actual conduct.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The core predictive challenge is now sharply defined. The case hinges on whether the Supreme Court will favor the petitioners' purpose-driven, categorical approach to standing or the respondents' evidence-based, market-realities approach. The respondents' explicit reliance on the Court's newest standing precedents from 2024 suggests they believe the Court's current trajectory favors their more stringent, fact-specific view.\n\n4.  **Confirmed Information Gap (Stable, but Reinforced):** The observation confirms that my analysis of the respondents' position is currently based only on the State Respondents' brief. A critical piece of evidence remains missing: the brief in opposition from the Federal Respondents (the EPA), as filed by the Solicitor General. The Solicitor General's arguments, framing, and choice of precedent are highly influential on the Court. While their position is expected to align with the states, the specific nuances of their legal reasoning are essential for a complete picture and represent the most significant remaining uncertainty in my predictive model.",

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.  J.A. 174; see Pet. Br. 38.  But the national market share \nof qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d between 2020 and 2022.  \nJ.A. 191.  In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.  And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, a failed search for the Federal Respondents' brief, did not introduce new substantive legal arguments but served to reinforce and refine my existing belief structure. My understanding of the case has evolved by confirming a key information gap and solidifying my analysis of the State Respondents' position.\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Position (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioners' core arguments remains unchanged. They continue to advocate for a categorical, purpose-driven standard for redressability, arguing that a regulation designed to suppress demand for their product inherently establishes standing upon challenge. They rely on precedents like *Bennett v. Spear* and assert that the D.C. Circuit's fact-intensive requirement is an outlier. On the merits, their challenge rests on the Major Questions Doctrine and the interpretation of \"compelling and extraordinary conditions\" under the Clean Air Act.\n\n2.  **State Respondents' Position (Stable & Reinforced):** The observation provided the full text of the State Respondents' brief, which I had previously analyzed. This re-exposure reinforces the centrality and strength of their arguments, which form the primary counter-narrative in my model. Their position is built on three pillars:\n    *   **Fact-Dependent Standing:** They explicitly ground their argument in the Supreme Court's most recent 2024 standing jurisprudence (*FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med.*, *Murthy v. Missouri*), arguing these cases mandate a \"heavily fact-dependent\" inquiry, not a categorical one.\n    *   **Evidentiary Failure:** They forcefully argue that the petitioners failed in their fundamental burden of proof by submitting **zero evidence** to demonstrate that automakers would change their behavior if the waiver were vacated.\n    *   **Causation Severed by Market Realities:** They introduced the crucial factual argument that by 2022, independent economic forces\u2014massive prior investments in EV technology, corporate sustainability goals, and strong consumer demand\u2014had become the primary drivers of automaker strategy, rendering the regulatory status of the waiver moot to their production decisions. This severs the causal chain necessary for redressability.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The predictive challenge remains sharply focused on the clash between two competing theories of standing. The Supreme Court must choose between the petitioners' categorical rule (if a regulation's purpose is to harm your market, standing is automatic) and the respondents' evidence-based rule (plaintiffs must prove with facts that a favorable court decision would actually change third-party behavior to redress their injury, especially when independent market forces are at play). The State Respondents' direct and repeated citation of the Court's 2024 standing cases is a strong signal that they believe the Court is trending towards their more stringent, fact-specific approach.\n\n4.  **Information Gap (Heightened & Confirmed):** My previous belief identified the absence of the Federal Respondents' brief as a key uncertainty. This observation's primary impact is to confirm and heighten the importance of this gap. The search action **failed** to find the brief filed by the Solicitor General on behalf of the EPA. This failure makes the gap more pronounced. While the Certificate of Service confirms that the Solicitor General's office is indeed representing the Federal Respondents, their specific legal reasoning, choice of precedent, and framing of the issue remain unknown. The Solicitor General's view is highly influential, and its absence is the most significant source of uncertainty in my ability to predict the Court's ruling. My model is incomplete until I can analyze how the U.S. government itself defends the EPA's actions and its view on the standing question.",

It demonstrates a core principle of effective intelligence gathering in adversarial environments: when a primary source is inaccessible, target a secondary source that directly engages with it.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the full Brief for the State Respondents provides a massive infusion of high-fidelity information, moving my understanding from a summary-level analysis to a granular, architectural comprehension of their legal strategy. While the Solicitor General's position remains a key unknown, the State Respondents' arguments, grounded in the Supreme Court's most recent jurisprudence, significantly sharpen the predictive landscape.\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Position (Stable but Contextualized):** My understanding of the petitioners' core argument\u2014that a regulation designed to suppress demand for their product creates a categorical basis for standing under precedents like *Bennett v. Spear*\u2014is unchanged. However, the State Respondents' brief frames this as a request for an \"automatic\" standing rule that requires no evidentiary support. This characterization effectively isolates the petitioners' theory and sets it in direct opposition to the fact-intensive inquiries the Supreme Court has recently favored, making the petitioners' legal lift appear steeper.\n\n2.  **State Respondents' Position (Massively Reinforced and Detailed):** This observation provides the complete blueprint for the State Respondents' case, reinforcing my prior beliefs with specific legal and factual architecture.\n    *   **Centrality of Evidentiary Failure:** Their argument is anchored in the stark assertion that petitioners submitted **zero evidence** to the D.C. Circuit to prove that vacating the waiver would change automaker behavior. They frame the entire dispute through their \"Question Presented,\" which focuses exclusively on whether petitioners met their evidentiary burden on redressability.\n    *   **The \"Severed Causation\" Narrative:** The brief articulates a clear timeline designed to break the causal chain required for standing. The key facts are: (1) The waiver was granted in 2013 and went unchallenged for six years. (2) During this period, automakers made massive investments and the market for EVs evolved. (3) By the time petitioners sued in 2022, independent economic forces\u2014prior investments, consumer demand, and corporate sustainability goals\u2014had become the primary drivers of EV production, rendering the waiver's legal status moot to automaker decisions. This narrative directly counters the petitioners' assumption that the regulation is the sole or even primary driver of their alleged injury.\n    *   **Alignment with Recent SCOTUS Precedent (Key New Signal):** The brief's most powerful feature is its direct and repeated reliance on the Supreme Court's most recent standing decisions from the 2023-2024 term: ***FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med.*** and ***Murthy v. Missouri***. They use these cases to argue that standing demands a \"heavily fact-dependent\" inquiry, not a categorical one. By explicitly grounding their argument in the Court's newest pronouncements, they are not asking the Court to innovate but to simply apply its own fresh precedent. This is a potent signal of confidence in their legal position.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Sharpened to a Fine Point):** The core conflict is now exceptionally clear. The Court is being asked to choose between two mutually exclusive models of redressability in cases involving third-party actors:\n    *   **Petitioners' Purpose-Based Rule:** Standing is established by the logical consequences of a regulation's intended purpose. If a rule is designed to harm a market, producers in that market have standing.\n    *   **Respondents' Evidence-Based Rule:** Standing requires concrete, factual proof that a favorable court decision will likely alter the behavior of independent third parties (automakers) to the plaintiff's benefit, especially when the factual record (as of the time of filing) suggests that independent market forces may have superseded the regulation's influence. The State Respondents argue that the Court's recent decisions in *FDA v. AHM* and *Murthy* have already endorsed their evidence-based model.\n\n4.  **Information Gap (Stable but Less Opaque):** The search again failed to locate the brief from the Federal Respondents (the Solicitor General), confirming this as the most significant remaining source of uncertainty. However, the State Respondents' comprehensive and powerful brief provides a strong template for what the SG is likely to argue. It is highly probable that the SG will also focus on the petitioners' failure of proof and the stringent, fact-specific standing requirements articulated in *Lujan*, *FDA v. AHM*, and *Murthy*. The primary uncertainty is no longer *what* the SG will argue, but rather the specific nuances of their reasoning, their treatment of *Bennett v. Spear*, and whether they diverge from the States' position in any subtle but meaningful way. The SG's view remains highly influential, but the likely path of their argument is now much clearer.",

No one disputes that, starting in 2013, \nCalifornia\u2019s standards forced automakers to produce far \nmore vehicles that use no or less liquid fuel.  No one dis-\nputes that, in reinstating those standards in 2022, both \nCalifornia and EPA said the standards were critical to de-\ncreasing the emissions that result from using liquid fuel.  \nNo one disputes that the parties have vigorously fought \nover the lawfulness of California\u2019s standards for the last \nthree years.  No one disputes that some automakers in-\ntervened here out of concern that vacating the waiver \nwould advantage competitors less invested in electric \nvehicles.  Nor does anyone dispute\u2014indeed, the United \n\n2 \n \nStates acknowledges\u2014that the President himself has \npublicly said that California\u2019s and EPA\u2019s actions have ar-\ntificially inflated the demand for electric vehicles and \nharmed consumers. \nEPA and California say only that petitioners had to \nand did not prove that California\u2019s standards matter to \nautomaker conduct by submitting sufficient evidence to \nthe court of appeals.  From the jump, respondents are \nwrong about the law.  Removing a coercive government \nstandard that cabins the use of a challenger\u2019s products \nprovides redress under Article III.  See Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Respondents reject \nthat straightforward legal rule.  They contend that if  \na regulatory target challenges a regulation that acts  \non a third party, it must \u201cprove\u201d redressability with \n\u201cevidence\u201d\u2014such as affidavits from \u201ceconomists,\u201d \nEPA Br. 43, 44, or facts from \u201csecurities and court fil-\nings,\u201d Cal. Br. 36\u2014showing how the third party will re-\nact to the coercive regulation, independent of market \nforces.  That rule is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents \nand would lock indirectly regulated entities out of ad-\nministrative challenges, keeping unlawful government \nmandates on the books. \nEven if petitioners could not rely on the removal of \nCalifornia\u2019s coercive standards alone to establish re-\ndressability, respondents are still wrong.  Petitioners \ncould rely on the \u201cpredictable\u201d effects of electric- \nvehicle \nmandates \nand \ngreenhouse-gas \nemission  \nstandards\u2014namely, reducing the use of liquid fuels.  \nDepartment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  Respondents contend that this is a unique \ncircumstance in which the market changed faster than \nexpected, outpacing the government regulations.  EPA \nBr. 31-35; Cal. Br. 17-22.  But respondents primarily \nrely on industry averages and certain automakers\u2019 \n\n3 \n \nplans\u2014which undercut rather than support the idea \nthat all automakers were irrevocably committed in \n2022 to meeting California\u2019s standards.  Respondents \nalso criticize petitioners for submitting \u201cno evidence\u201d \non redressability, EPA Br. 39; Cal. Br. 3, and then \nspend pages attacking that evidence in painstaking de-\ntail.  EPA Br. 35-38; Cal. Br. 45-48. \nAlong the way, neither EPA nor California fully de-\nfends the decision below.  All parties now agree that \nthe court of appeals mistakenly believed that the \nwaiver is of \u201crelatively short duration\u201d and expires in \n2025, Pet. App. 22a, when some of its standards in fact \nlast in perpetuity, EPA Br. 45; Cal. Br. 43-44.  Re-\nspondents are thus left to argue harmlessness.  They \nassert that a regulation that imposes an unlawful gov-\nernment mandate forever is unchallengeable if it tracks \ncurrent \u201cmarket forces\u201d when enacted.  E.g., Cal. Br. \n20-21; EPA Br. 16-17.  \u201c[I]f you find yourself in a place \nas absurd as that, you might want to consider whether \nyou\u2019ve taken a wrong turn along the way.\u201d  Kisor v. \nWilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 607 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring in the judgment).  It is simply incorrect that a \nmandate applicable to more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s \nnew vehicle market was unchallengeable from the day \nit was reinstated in 2022.  \nARGUMENT \nPETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nRespondents agree that this case turns on whether \npetitioners satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability compo-\nnent.  See Cal. Br. 14; EPA Br. 19.  First, they contend \nthat vacating a government regulation prohibiting or \nrestricting the sale of the challenger\u2019s products is in-\nsufficient to establish redressability.  That is wrong.  \nNext, they argue that, on the record here, these much-\n\n4 \nballyhooed and much-contested regulations were \npointless from the moment they were reinstated.  That \nis implausible.  Finally, they acknowledge that the \ncourt of appeals misunderstood the perpetual nature of \nthe waiver but contend that there is nothing petitioners \ncan do to challenge it, ever.  That is shocking.  This \nCourt should reject any one of respondents\u2019 arguments \nand reverse. \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability\nBecause They Are Challenging A Government\nRestriction On The Sale Of Their Products\nThe removal of the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on automakers is suffi-\ncient to establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at \n169.\nRespondents mischaracterize this straightfor-\nward legal rule, and then attack it as inconsistent with\nprecedent and basic Article III principles.  They are\nmistaken on all fronts.\n1.\nRespondents first overstate the breadth of a\ncommonsense categorical rule.  As petitioners have ex-\nplained (at 25-28), a challenger establishes redressabil-\nity if a decision in its favor would remove a \u201cdirect reg-\nulatory impediment\u201d to its product\u2019s use.  Energy Fu-\nture Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThat rule need not extend to any \u201cregulation implicat-\ning the use of [a] product,\u201d Cal. Br. 31, or any \u201clegal \nimpediment to third-party conduct that would benefit \nthe plaintiff,\u201d EPA Br. 16.  Instead, petitioners\u2019 rule \nmerely simplifies an analysis that yields an obvious \nconclusion:  when the government tells automakers to \nmake more cars that use less fuel, there is \u201clittle ques-\ntion\u201d that fuel producers have standing to sue.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  The same is true of pri-\nvate schools when the government forbids parents \nfrom sending their kids there, see Pierce v. Society of \n\n5 \n \nthe Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, \n268 U.S. 510, 534-536 (1925); of networks when the gov-\nernment tells broadcasters not to partner with them, \nsee CBS v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 422-423 (1942); \nof muffler producers when EPA imposes \u201ca no-muffler \nmandate on vehicle manufacturers,\u201d API Br. 6; or of \nsoda manufacturers when the government prohibits re-\ntailers from selling jumbo-sized soft drinks, Chamber \nBr. 10. \nOr at least one would think.  California disagrees \nand offers (at 33-34) its own hypothetical that crystal-\nlizes this dispute.  Assume the FDA forbids soda mak-\ners from using sugar in more than 80% of their sodas, \nwith the express purpose of reducing sugar consump-\ntion.  Many soda makers do not feel strongly, as 30% of \ncurrent sodas on the market are already sugar-free.  \nBut sugar refiners certainly care\u2014they want to in-\ncrease their market share without government inter-\nference, or sell without limits to those soda makers that \nwould prefer to use more sugar than the average.  As \nCalifornia sees it, even if the cap on sugary beverages \nis patently unlawful, sugar refiners cannot sue\u2014and \nmay forever be time-barred from doing so\u2014because, \nfor now, the market average exceeds the illegal man-\ndate.  Redressability doctrine has never functioned \nthat way. \nAnd that is just the example California apparently \nsees as most favorable to its cause.  The absurdities of \nrespondents\u2019 position only get worse from there.  As-\nsume the FCC enacts a regulation prohibiting net-\nworks from airing football more than four nights a \nweek because Americans should diversify their tastes.  \nUnder respondents\u2019 rule, the NFL could not challenge \nthe regulation because networks currently air games \nonly three or four nights per week.  Similarly, Tesla \n\n6 \n \ncould not have challenged a law barring car dealers \nfrom devoting more than 5% of their lots to electric ve-\nhicles, so long as the electric-vehicle market was in its \ninfancy.  And if California required Starbucks to sell at \nleast 50% of its coffee to women because it wanted busi-\nnesses to be more female-friendly, men could not bring \nan equal-protection challenge if women are already \nhalf of Starbucks customers.   \nNone of this makes any sense.  Respondents\u2019 view \nof redressability fails to account for dynamic markets \nand the influence of government mandates.  It allows \nagencies to set unlawful regulatory floors during a \nmarket high, and\u2014with assistance from statutes of \nlimitations\u2014permanently insulate their illegal regula-\ntions from judicial review.  California\u2019s (at 19-22) and \nEPA\u2019s (at 32-34) discussions of \u201cmarket forces\u201d are \nthus irrelevant.  Even in the unlikely event that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s standards matched what market forces were \nproducing in 2022, but see pp. 15-17, infra, the regula-\ntions illegally locked into place a minimum market \nshare for electric and low-emission vehicles.1  Remov-\ning the waiver allows market forces to once again gov-\nern.  Fuel producers would be free to sell what the mar-\nket will bear.  At a minimum, they would have the abil-\nity to persuade automakers and consumers to shift \naway from electric vehicles through lower prices,  \n \n1 \nRespondents repeatedly fault petitioners for not challenging \nEPA\u2019s initial waiver in 2013.  See, e.g., Cal. Br. 18; EPA Br. 17.  As \nCalifornia acknowledges, however, D.C. Circuit precedent as of 2013 \nprecluded petitioners from challenging the waiver to the extent it ap-\nplied to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards.  See Chamber of \nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  California \ncounters (at 18 n.7) that petitioners could have challenged Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver for the zero-emission-vehicle mandate, but at the time \nthe two market constraints significantly overlapped.  See 78 Fed. \nReg. 2,112, 2,130-2,131 (Jan. 9, 2013).    \n\n7 \n \nimproved marketing, technological innovations, or  \notherwise\u2014just as the NFL, Tesla, and coffee drinkers \nwould remain free to shift others\u2019 market preferences. \n2. Respondents next try to distinguish this Court\u2019s \ncases establishing or applying the straightforward \nprinciple that the removal of a regulatory barrier to the \nuse of one\u2019s product establishes redressability.  But \nthey make each case far more complicated than this \nCourt saw it. \nIn Bennett, the Court held that an injury can be re-\ndressed by removing a \u201ccoercive\u201d government regula-\ntion that \u201calters the legal regime.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169.  \nEPA (at 25) and California (at 29) say that was not \nenough to establish standing in Bennett.  They note \nthat the Court also relied on evidence that the Bureau \nof Reclamation would have changed course if the Fish \nand Wildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion were vacated.  \nBut that misses the point of why the Court looked at \nthat evidence.  The government argued that the biolog-\nical opinion was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and not actually \nbinding.  520 U.S. at 169.  The Court therefore had to \nask whether \u201cin reality it ha[d] a powerful coercive ef-\nfect\u201d on the Bureau.  Ibid.  Here, there is no question \nthat California\u2019s standards are legally binding on au-\ntomakers, and accordingly there is no need for a fur-\nther inquiry into what effects those standards have in \npractice.  Simply put, if the government had conceded \nin Bennett that the biological opinion was binding, \nthere would have been no doubt about standing. \nRegardless, even if Bennett did require something \nmore than the existence of \u201ccoercive\u201d government ac-\ntion, that something was far less than what respond-\nents demand here.  It was enough for the Bennett chal-\nlengers to allege that the Bureau had historically oper-\nated the dam \u201cin the same manner\u201d for a long time and \n\n8 \n \nthen changed its practice after the biological opinion, \nwhich \u201calter[ed] the legal regime to which the [Bureau] \nis subject.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169, 170.  All of that is true \nhere.  Automakers manufactured liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles for a long time, until California\u2019s standards \nforced them to change.  Petitioners have thus \u201cmet \ntheir burden\u201d of showing that their injuries \u201cwill \n\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed,\u201d at least to some extent, by lifting \nCalifornia\u2019s standards.  Id. at 171. \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish this Court\u2019s \nother cases fare no better.  Respondents emphasize \nthat Pierce and CBS involved \u201cfactual allegations, of \nharms likely to be redressed.\u201d  EPA Br. 27; Cal. Br. 30.  \nBut in Pierce, this Court did not rely on \u201cfactual alle-\ngations\u201d of harm because the \u201cinevitable practical re-\nsult of enforcing the act\u201d\u2014criminalizing sending chil-\ndren to private schools\u2014would be \u201cdestruction of \u201d the \nchallenging private schools.  268 U.S. at 534, 536.  And \nin CBS, it was \u201cenough\u201d that the challenged \u201cregula-\ntions purport[ed] to operate to alter and affect ad-\nversely\u201d the challenging broadcast companies\u2019 \u201ccon-\ntractual rights and business relations with station own-\ners.\u201d  316 U.S. at 422.  Moreover, even if relevant, the \nbare allegations of harm in Pierce and CBS offered far \nless evidence of injury than petitioners supplied here \nin their declarations alone.  See J.A. 211.  EPA says (at \n26-27) this case is different because Pierce and CBS \nconcerned the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s business relationship with a \nthird party,\u201d while here there is \u201cnot any transaction \nbetween vehicle manufacturers and fuel producers.\u201d  \nThat ad hoc limit is irrelevant.  The key question is the \nlikely reaction of the directly regulated party. \nNor has the Court stopped with Bennett, Pierce, \nand CBS.  For example, this Court has recognized that \n\n9 \n \nbusinesses have standing to challenge actions that in-\ncrease competition for \u201cpersons who might otherwise \nbe their customers\u201d; they do not have to prove that \nthose potential customers will become actual custom-\ners.  National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l \nBank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998).  EPA \nderides (at 42 n.2) this principle as confined to the \n\u201ccompetitor standing\u201d context.  That is yet another \nmade-up limit.  In any event, \u201c[s]uits where one busi-\nness challenges the under-regulation of another go well \nbeyond competitor suits.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Board \nof Governors of Fed. Resrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 834 \n(2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).   \nRespondents also fail to distinguish the most \non-point lower-court decision, Energy Future Coali-\ntion.  The court of appeals there held that biofuel pro-\nducers had standing to challenge \u201ca direct regulatory \nimpediment that prevent[ed]\u201d the use of biofuel.  \n793 F.3d at 144.  Respondents spin that holding as an \n\u201cobservation\u201d \u201cpremised on the court\u2019s determination \nthat some vehicle manufacturers would actually use\u201d \nbiofuel if permitted.  EPA Br. 27-28; see Cal. Br. 31-32.  \nThe court said the opposite:  \u201c \u2018vehicle manufacturers \nmay have valid business reasons\u2019 other than EPA\u2019s\u201d \nregulations not to use biofuels, but \u201cthat does not un-\ndermine causation\u201d because the plaintiffs were \u201csimply \nseek[ing] an opportunity to compete in the market-\nplace.\u201d  793 F.3d at 144. \nAt bottom, redressability usually \u201cfollows\u201d when a \nregulation causes an injury:  once the regulation goes \naway, so does the injury.  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jackson-\nville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 n.5 (1993).  Despite respondents\u2019 \nattempts to distinguish various decisions exemplifying \n\n10 \n \nthat principle, they have not come up with a single \ncounterexample. \n3. Respondents also repeatedly argue that peti-\ntioners\u2019 rule cannot be reconciled with basic Article III \nprecepts.  They correctly note that \u201cstanding is not dis-\npensed in gross,\u201d but jump to the unrelated conclusion \nthat there are no \u201ccategorical rules\u201d that can simplify \nthe standing analysis.  EPA Br. 28 (quoting Murthy v. \nMissouri, 603 U.S. 43, 61 (2024)); see Cal. Br. 33.  That \nleap is irreconcilable with this Court\u2019s standing doc-\ntrine.  Here, as in other areas, this Court has adopted \nsome rules to guide litigants and lower courts.  See, e.g., \nCzyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 \n(2017) (\u201cFor standing purposes, a loss of even a small \namount of money is ordinarily an \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d); Seila Law \nLLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 211 (2020) (challenge to of-\nficer unlawfully insulated from removal need not prove \nthat a lawfully serving officer would have acted differ-\nently).  \nIn a similar vein, respondents contend that petition-\ners\u2019 straightforward rule would gut the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing.  EPA Br. 28-29; Cal. \nBr. 32-34.  It would not.  Historically, redressability \nhas ensured that the right parties are before the court, \nwhich can issue relief tied to a concrete factual context.  \nSee FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \n367, 379-380 (2024); see also Cato Br. 5; Children\u2019s \nTrust Br. 6-8, 14.  This case does not implicate those \ntraditional functions.  To be sure, redressability is usu-\nally easy when a party sues to vacate a regulation tar-\ngeting its product, because there is a perfect match be-\ntween injury and remedy.  But that means only that \nArticle III is satisfied here, not that it is a dead letter.   \n\n11 \n \nB. Alternatively, Petitioners Have Established  \nRedressability On The Record Here \nEven if there is no categorical rule of redressability \nfor challenges to coercive government action, petition-\ners have satisfied Article III on the record here.  The \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s demand for additional \u201crecord evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. App. 24a, disregarded this Court\u2019s prece-\ndent allowing challengers to rely on the predictable  \neffects of California\u2019s standards.  Respondents are \nwrong to contend that petitioners cannot rely on such \ninferences, or that such inferences are inappropriate \nhere.   \n1. Commonsense \ninferences \nestablish  \nredressability here  \nIn establishing redressability, petitioners are enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201cpredictable effect of Government \naction on the decisions of third parties.\u201d  Department \nof Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768.  The application of that \nprinciple is straightforward here:  if EPA\u2019s waiver \nwere vacated, at least some automakers would predict-\nably produce more vehicles that use more liquid fuel.   \na.  California alone resists the proposition that a \nparty can ever rely on predictable inferences to estab-\nlish redressability.  According to California (at 41), \nwhen it comes to standing, \u201cevidence\u201d is always re-\nquired to establish even the most obvious proposition.  \nThat flat (and inefficient) rule is impossible to square \nwith this Court\u2019s decisions, as even EPA apparently \nrecognizes (at 39).   \nCalifornia relies on Summers v. Earth Island Insti-\ntute, which it says rejected the proposition that parties \ncan rely on commonsense inferences.  Cal. Br. 41-42 \n(citing 555 U.S. 488 (2009)).  This Court has already \ndisagreed, citing Summers for its observation that it is \n\n12 \n \n\u201cpredictable\u201d that when a government \u201cregulates \nparks [or] national forests,\u201d it will affect the area\u2019s ac-\ntual users.  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at \n385 (citing 555 U.S. at 494).  Notably, this Court in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine also observed in the \nsame paragraph that where, as here, the government \nregulates a business, that regulation can predictably \ncause \u201cdownstream or upstream economic injuries to \nothers in the chain.\u201d  Id. at 384.  This Court has not \nshied away from embracing the obvious.   \nIn arguing that the Court should change course \nnow, respondents cannot get around Department of \nCommerce\u2019s holding that challengers can rely \u201con the \npredictable effect of Government action on the deci-\nsions of third parties.\u201d  588 U.S. at 768.  Respondents \npoint out that the record in that case included evidence \nabout noncitizens\u2019 historical census response rates.  \nEPA Br. 39-40; Cal. Br. 39.  But no one here disputes \nthat automakers have \u201chistorically\u201d reacted to Califor-\nnia\u2019s mandatory standards by producing and selling \nfewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  See Cal. Br. 18-19; \nJ.A. 110, 112.  That is not enough for respondents.  Un-\nder their view, petitioners had to submit affidavits \nproving automakers\u2019 likely future response to a gov-\nernment action, see pp. 17-19, infra, which is exactly \nwhat this Court in Department of Commerce deemed \nunnecessary.   \nNor does reliance on common sense require courts \nto engage in unwarranted guesswork.  This Court \u201chas \nidentified a variety of familiar circumstances where \ngovernment regulation of a third-party individual or \nbusiness may be likely to cause injury in fact to an un-\nregulated plaintiff.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. at 384.  The organizing principle behind these \n\u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d is the same basic inference \n\n13 \n \napplied in Department of Commerce:  third parties of-\nten react in predictable ways when subject to govern-\nment action.  See 588 U.S. at 785 (Judges \u201care \u2018not re-\nquired to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 from which ordinary citizens \nare free.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 F.2d \n1294, 1300 (2d Cir. 1977) (Friendly, J.)).2  \nAt a minimum, this Court can safely rest redressa-\nbility on the predictable results of government regula-\ntion if the regulator itself presupposes that effect.  Pet. \nBr. 31-32.  In addressing redressability in Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 526 (2007), this Court \u201cat-\ntach[ed] considerable significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own as-\nsessments of regulato\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

No one disputes that, starting in 2013, \nCalifornia\u2019s standards forced automakers to produce far \nmore vehicles that use no or less liquid fuel.  No one dis-\nputes that, in reinstating those standards in 2022, both \nCalifornia and EPA said the standards were critical to de-\ncreasing the emissions that result from using liquid fuel.  \nNo one disputes that the parties have vigorously fought \nover the lawfulness of California\u2019s standards for the last \nthree years.  No one disputes that some automakers in-\ntervened here out of concern that vacating the waiver \nwould advantage competitors less invested in electric \nvehicles.  Nor does anyone dispute\u2014indeed, the United \n\n2 \n \nStates acknowledges\u2014that the President himself has \npublicly said that California\u2019s and EPA\u2019s actions have ar-\ntificially inflated the demand for electric vehicles and \nharmed consumers. \nEPA and California say only that petitioners had to \nand did not prove that California\u2019s standards matter to \nautomaker conduct by submitting sufficient evidence to \nthe court of appeals.  From the jump, respondents are \nwrong about the law.  Removing a coercive government \nstandard that cabins the use of a challenger\u2019s products \nprovides redress under Article III.  See Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Respondents reject \nthat straightforward legal rule.  They contend that if  \na regulatory target challenges a regulation that acts  \non a third party, it must \u201cprove\u201d redressability with \n\u201cevidence\u201d\u2014such as affidavits from \u201ceconomists,\u201d \nEPA Br. 43, 44, or facts from \u201csecurities and court fil-\nings,\u201d Cal. Br. 36\u2014showing how the third party will re-\nact to the coercive regulation, independent of market \nforces.  That rule is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents \nand would lock indirectly regulated entities out of ad-\nministrative challenges, keeping unlawful government \nmandates on the books. \nEven if petitioners could not rely on the removal of \nCalifornia\u2019s coercive standards alone to establish re-\ndressability, respondents are still wrong.  Petitioners \ncould rely on the \u201cpredictable\u201d effects of electric- \nvehicle \nmandates \nand \ngreenhouse-gas \nemission  \nstandards\u2014namely, reducing the use of liquid fuels.  \nDepartment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  Respondents contend that this is a unique \ncircumstance in which the market changed faster than \nexpected, outpacing the government regulations.  EPA \nBr. 31-35; Cal. Br. 17-22.  But respondents primarily \nrely on industry averages and certain automakers\u2019 \n\n3 \n \nplans\u2014which undercut rather than support the idea \nthat all automakers were irrevocably committed in \n2022 to meeting California\u2019s standards.  Respondents \nalso criticize petitioners for submitting \u201cno evidence\u201d \non redressability, EPA Br. 39; Cal. Br. 3, and then \nspend pages attacking that evidence in painstaking de-\ntail.  EPA Br. 35-38; Cal. Br. 45-48. \nAlong the way, neither EPA nor California fully de-\nfends the decision below.  All parties now agree that \nthe court of appeals mistakenly believed that the \nwaiver is of \u201crelatively short duration\u201d and expires in \n2025, Pet. App. 22a, when some of its standards in fact \nlast in perpetuity, EPA Br. 45; Cal. Br. 43-44.  Re-\nspondents are thus left to argue harmlessness.  They \nassert that a regulation that imposes an unlawful gov-\nernment mandate forever is unchallengeable if it tracks \ncurrent \u201cmarket forces\u201d when enacted.  E.g., Cal. Br. \n20-21; EPA Br. 16-17.  \u201c[I]f you find yourself in a place \nas absurd as that, you might want to consider whether \nyou\u2019ve taken a wrong turn along the way.\u201d  Kisor v. \nWilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 607 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring in the judgment).  It is simply incorrect that a \nmandate applicable to more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s \nnew vehicle market was unchallengeable from the day \nit was reinstated in 2022.  \nARGUMENT \nPETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nRespondents agree that this case turns on whether \npetitioners satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability compo-\nnent.  See Cal. Br. 14; EPA Br. 19.  First, they contend \nthat vacating a government regulation prohibiting or \nrestricting the sale of the challenger\u2019s products is in-\nsufficient to establish redressability.  That is wrong.  \nNext, they argue that, on the record here, these much-\n\n4 \nballyhooed and much-contested regulations were \npointless from the moment they were reinstated.  That \nis implausible.  Finally, they acknowledge that the \ncourt of appeals misunderstood the perpetual nature of \nthe waiver but contend that there is nothing petitioners \ncan do to challenge it, ever.  That is shocking.  This \nCourt should reject any one of respondents\u2019 arguments \nand reverse. \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability\nBecause They Are Challenging A Government\nRestriction On The Sale Of Their Products\nThe removal of the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on automakers is suffi-\ncient to establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at \n169.\nRespondents mischaracterize this straightfor-\nward legal rule, and then attack it as inconsistent with\nprecedent and basic Article III principles.  They are\nmistaken on all fronts.\n1.\nRespondents first overstate the breadth of a\ncommonsense categorical rule.  As petitioners have ex-\nplained (at 25-28), a challenger establishes redressabil-\nity if a decision in its favor would remove a \u201cdirect reg-\nulatory impediment\u201d to its product\u2019s use.  Energy Fu-\nture Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThat rule need not extend to any \u201cregulation implicat-\ning the use of [a] product,\u201d Cal. Br. 31, or any \u201clegal \nimpediment to third-party conduct that would benefit \nthe plaintiff,\u201d EPA Br. 16.  Instead, petitioners\u2019 rule \nmerely simplifies an analysis that yields an obvious \nconclusion:  when the government tells automakers to \nmake more cars that use less fuel, there is \u201clittle ques-\ntion\u201d that fuel producers have standing to sue.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  The same is true of pri-\nvate schools when the government forbids parents \nfrom sending their kids there, see Pierce v. Society of \n\n5 \n \nthe Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, \n268 U.S. 510, 534-536 (1925); of networks when the gov-\nernment tells broadcasters not to partner with them, \nsee CBS v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 422-423 (1942); \nof muffler producers when EPA imposes \u201ca no-muffler \nmandate on vehicle manufacturers,\u201d API Br. 6; or of \nsoda manufacturers when the government prohibits re-\ntailers from selling jumbo-sized soft drinks, Chamber \nBr. 10. \nOr at least one would think.  California disagrees \nand offers (at 33-34) its own hypothetical that crystal-\nlizes this dispute.  Assume the FDA forbids soda mak-\ners from using sugar in more than 80% of their sodas, \nwith the express purpose of reducing sugar consump-\ntion.  Many soda makers do not feel strongly, as 30% of \ncurrent sodas on the market are already sugar-free.  \nBut sugar refiners certainly care\u2014they want to in-\ncrease their market share without government inter-\nference, or sell without limits to those soda makers that \nwould prefer to use more sugar than the average.  As \nCalifornia sees it, even if the cap on sugary beverages \nis patently unlawful, sugar refiners cannot sue\u2014and \nmay forever be time-barred from doing so\u2014because, \nfor now, the market average exceeds the illegal man-\ndate.  Redressability doctrine has never functioned \nthat way. \nAnd that is just the example California apparently \nsees as most favorable to its cause.  The absurdities of \nrespondents\u2019 position only get worse from there.  As-\nsume the FCC enacts a regulation prohibiting net-\nworks from airing football more than four nights a \nweek because Americans should diversify their tastes.  \nUnder respondents\u2019 rule, the NFL could not challenge \nthe regulation because networks currently air games \nonly three or four nights per week.  Similarly, Tesla \n\n6 \n \ncould not have challenged a law barring car dealers \nfrom devoting more than 5% of their lots to electric ve-\nhicles, so long as the electric-vehicle market was in its \ninfancy.  And if California required Starbucks to sell at \nleast 50% of its coffee to women because it wanted busi-\nnesses to be more female-friendly, men could not bring \nan equal-protection challenge if women are already \nhalf of Starbucks customers.   \nNone of this makes any sense.  Respondents\u2019 view \nof redressability fails to account for dynamic markets \nand the influence of government mandates.  It allows \nagencies to set unlawful regulatory floors during a \nmarket high, and\u2014with assistance from statutes of \nlimitations\u2014permanently insulate their illegal regula-\ntions from judicial review.  California\u2019s (at 19-22) and \nEPA\u2019s (at 32-34) discussions of \u201cmarket forces\u201d are \nthus irrelevant.  Even in the unlikely event that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s standards matched what market forces were \nproducing in 2022, but see pp. 15-17, infra, the regula-\ntions illegally locked into place a minimum market \nshare for electric and low-emission vehicles.1  Remov-\ning the waiver allows market forces to once again gov-\nern.  Fuel producers would be free to sell what the mar-\nket will bear.  At a minimum, they would have the abil-\nity to persuade automakers and consumers to shift \naway from electric vehicles through lower prices,  \n \n1 \nRespondents repeatedly fault petitioners for not challenging \nEPA\u2019s initial waiver in 2013.  See, e.g., Cal. Br. 18; EPA Br. 17.  As \nCalifornia acknowledges, however, D.C. Circuit precedent as of 2013 \nprecluded petitioners from challenging the waiver to the extent it ap-\nplied to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards.  See Chamber of \nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  California \ncounters (at 18 n.7) that petitioners could have challenged Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver for the zero-emission-vehicle mandate, but at the time \nthe two market constraints significantly overlapped.  See 78 Fed. \nReg. 2,112, 2,130-2,131 (Jan. 9, 2013).    \n\n7 \n \nimproved marketing, technological innovations, or  \notherwise\u2014just as the NFL, Tesla, and coffee drinkers \nwould remain free to shift others\u2019 market preferences. \n2. Respondents next try to distinguish this Court\u2019s \ncases establishing or applying the straightforward \nprinciple that the removal of a regulatory barrier to the \nuse of one\u2019s product establishes redressability.  But \nthey make each case far more complicated than this \nCourt saw it. \nIn Bennett, the Court held that an injury can be re-\ndressed by removing a \u201ccoercive\u201d government regula-\ntion that \u201calters the legal regime.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169.  \nEPA (at 25) and California (at 29) say that was not \nenough to establish standing in Bennett.  They note \nthat the Court also relied on evidence that the Bureau \nof Reclamation would have changed course if the Fish \nand Wildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion were vacated.  \nBut that misses the point of why the Court looked at \nthat evidence.  The government argued that the biolog-\nical opinion was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and not actually \nbinding.  520 U.S. at 169.  The Court therefore had to \nask whether \u201cin reality it ha[d] a powerful coercive ef-\nfect\u201d on the Bureau.  Ibid.  Here, there is no question \nthat California\u2019s standards are legally binding on au-\ntomakers, and accordingly there is no need for a fur-\nther inquiry into what effects those standards have in \npractice.  Simply put, if the government had conceded \nin Bennett that the biological opinion was binding, \nthere would have been no doubt about standing. \nRegardless, even if Bennett did require something \nmore than the existence of \u201ccoercive\u201d government ac-\ntion, that something was far less than what respond-\nents demand here.  It was enough for the Bennett chal-\nlengers to allege that the Bureau had historically oper-\nated the dam \u201cin the same manner\u201d for a long time and \n\n8 \n \nthen changed its practice after the biological opinion, \nwhich \u201calter[ed] the legal regime to which the [Bureau] \nis subject.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169, 170.  All of that is true \nhere.  Automakers manufactured liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles for a long time, until California\u2019s standards \nforced them to change.  Petitioners have thus \u201cmet \ntheir burden\u201d of showing that their injuries \u201cwill \n\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed,\u201d at least to some extent, by lifting \nCalifornia\u2019s standards.  Id. at 171. \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish this Court\u2019s \nother cases fare no better.  Respondents emphasize \nthat Pierce and CBS involved \u201cfactual allegations, of \nharms likely to be redressed.\u201d  EPA Br. 27; Cal. Br. 30.  \nBut in Pierce, this Court did not rely on \u201cfactual alle-\ngations\u201d of harm because the \u201cinevitable practical re-\nsult of enforcing the act\u201d\u2014criminalizing sending chil-\ndren to private schools\u2014would be \u201cdestruction of \u201d the \nchallenging private schools.  268 U.S. at 534, 536.  And \nin CBS, it was \u201cenough\u201d that the challenged \u201cregula-\ntions purport[ed] to operate to alter and affect ad-\nversely\u201d the challenging broadcast companies\u2019 \u201ccon-\ntractual rights and business relations with station own-\ners.\u201d  316 U.S. at 422.  Moreover, even if relevant, the \nbare allegations of harm in Pierce and CBS offered far \nless evidence of injury than petitioners supplied here \nin their declarations alone.  See J.A. 211.  EPA says (at \n26-27) this case is different because Pierce and CBS \nconcerned the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s business relationship with a \nthird party,\u201d while here there is \u201cnot any transaction \nbetween vehicle manufacturers and fuel producers.\u201d  \nThat ad hoc limit is irrelevant.  The key question is the \nlikely reaction of the directly regulated party. \nNor has the Court stopped with Bennett, Pierce, \nand CBS.  For example, this Court has recognized that \n\n9 \n \nbusinesses have standing to challenge actions that in-\ncrease competition for \u201cpersons who might otherwise \nbe their customers\u201d; they do not have to prove that \nthose potential customers will become actual custom-\ners.  National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l \nBank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998).  EPA \nderides (at 42 n.2) this principle as confined to the \n\u201ccompetitor standing\u201d context.  That is yet another \nmade-up limit.  In any event, \u201c[s]uits where one busi-\nness challenges the under-regulation of another go well \nbeyond competitor suits.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Board \nof Governors of Fed. Resrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 834 \n(2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).   \nRespondents also fail to distinguish the most \non-point lower-court decision, Energy Future Coali-\ntion.  The court of appeals there held that biofuel pro-\nducers had standing to challenge \u201ca direct regulatory \nimpediment that prevent[ed]\u201d the use of biofuel.  \n793 F.3d at 144.  Respondents spin that holding as an \n\u201cobservation\u201d \u201cpremised on the court\u2019s determination \nthat some vehicle manufacturers would actually use\u201d \nbiofuel if permitted.  EPA Br. 27-28; see Cal. Br. 31-32.  \nThe court said the opposite:  \u201c \u2018vehicle manufacturers \nmay have valid business reasons\u2019 other than EPA\u2019s\u201d \nregulations not to use biofuels, but \u201cthat does not un-\ndermine causation\u201d because the plaintiffs were \u201csimply \nseek[ing] an opportunity to compete in the market-\nplace.\u201d  793 F.3d at 144. \nAt bottom, redressability usually \u201cfollows\u201d when a \nregulation causes an injury:  once the regulation goes \naway, so does the injury.  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jackson-\nville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 n.5 (1993).  Despite respondents\u2019 \nattempts to distinguish various decisions exemplifying \n\n10 \n \nthat principle, they have not come up with a single \ncounterexample. \n3. Respondents also repeatedly argue that peti-\ntioners\u2019 rule cannot be reconciled with basic Article III \nprecepts.  They correctly note that \u201cstanding is not dis-\npensed in gross,\u201d but jump to the unrelated conclusion \nthat there are no \u201ccategorical rules\u201d that can simplify \nthe standing analysis.  EPA Br. 28 (quoting Murthy v. \nMissouri, 603 U.S. 43, 61 (2024)); see Cal. Br. 33.  That \nleap is irreconcilable with this Court\u2019s standing doc-\ntrine.  Here, as in other areas, this Court has adopted \nsome rules to guide litigants and lower courts.  See, e.g., \nCzyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 \n(2017) (\u201cFor standing purposes, a loss of even a small \namount of money is ordinarily an \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d); Seila Law \nLLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 211 (2020) (challenge to of-\nficer unlawfully insulated from removal need not prove \nthat a lawfully serving officer would have acted differ-\nently).  \nIn a similar vein, respondents contend that petition-\ners\u2019 straightforward rule would gut the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing.  EPA Br. 28-29; Cal. \nBr. 32-34.  It would not.  Historically, redressability \nhas ensured that the right parties are before the court, \nwhich can issue relief tied to a concrete factual context.  \nSee FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \n367, 379-380 (2024); see also Cato Br. 5; Children\u2019s \nTrust Br. 6-8, 14.  This case does not implicate those \ntraditional functions.  To be sure, redressability is usu-\nally easy when a party sues to vacate a regulation tar-\ngeting its product, because there is a perfect match be-\ntween injury and remedy.  But that means only that \nArticle III is satisfied here, not that it is a dead letter.   \n\n11 \n \nB. Alternatively, Petitioners Have Established  \nRedressability On The Record Here \nEven if there is no categorical rule of redressability \nfor challenges to coercive government action, petition-\ners have satisfied Article III on the record here.  The \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s demand for additional \u201crecord evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. App. 24a, disregarded this Court\u2019s prece-\ndent allowing challengers to rely on the predictable  \neffects of California\u2019s standards.  Respondents are \nwrong to contend that petitioners cannot rely on such \ninferences, or that such inferences are inappropriate \nhere.   \n1. Commonsense \ninferences \nestablish  \nredressability here  \nIn establishing redressability, petitioners are enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201cpredictable effect of Government \naction on the decisions of third parties.\u201d  Department \nof Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768.  The application of that \nprinciple is straightforward here:  if EPA\u2019s waiver \nwere vacated, at least some automakers would predict-\nably produce more vehicles that use more liquid fuel.   \na.  California alone resists the proposition that a \nparty can ever rely on predictable inferences to estab-\nlish redressability.  According to California (at 41), \nwhen it comes to standing, \u201cevidence\u201d is always re-\nquired to establish even the most obvious proposition.  \nThat flat (and inefficient) rule is impossible to square \nwith this Court\u2019s decisions, as even EPA apparently \nrecognizes (at 39).   \nCalifornia relies on Summers v. Earth Island Insti-\ntute, which it says rejected the proposition that parties \ncan rely on commonsense inferences.  Cal. Br. 41-42 \n(citing 555 U.S. 488 (2009)).  This Court has already \ndisagreed, citing Summers for its observation that it is \n\n12 \n \n\u201cpredictable\u201d that when a government \u201cregulates \nparks [or] national forests,\u201d it will affect the area\u2019s ac-\ntual users.  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at \n385 (citing 555 U.S. at 494).  Notably, this Court in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine also observed in the \nsame paragraph that where, as here, the government \nregulates a business, that regulation can predictably \ncause \u201cdownstream or upstream economic injuries to \nothers in the chain.\u201d  Id. at 384.  This Court has not \nshied away from embracing the obvious.   \nIn arguing that the Court should change course \nnow, respondents cannot get around Department of \nCommerce\u2019s holding that challengers can rely \u201con the \npredictable effect of Government action on the deci-\nsions of third parties.\u201d  588 U.S. at 768.  Respondents \npoint out that the record in that case included evidence \nabout noncitizens\u2019 historical census response rates.  \nEPA Br. 39-40; Cal. Br. 39.  But no one here disputes \nthat automakers have \u201chistorically\u201d reacted to Califor-\nnia\u2019s mandatory standards by producing and selling \nfewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  See Cal. Br. 18-19; \nJ.A. 110, 112.  That is not enough for respondents.  Un-\nder their view, petitioners had to submit affidavits \nproving automakers\u2019 likely future response to a gov-\nernment action, see pp. 17-19, infra, which is exactly \nwhat this Court in Department of Commerce deemed \nunnecessary.   \nNor does reliance on common sense require courts \nto engage in unwarranted guesswork.  This Court \u201chas \nidentified a variety of familiar circumstances where \ngovernment regulation of a third-party individual or \nbusiness may be likely to cause injury in fact to an un-\nregulated plaintiff.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. at 384.  The organizing principle behind these \n\u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d is the same basic inference \n\n13 \n \napplied in Department of Commerce:  third parties of-\nten react in predictable ways when subject to govern-\nment action.  See 588 U.S. at 785 (Judges \u201care \u2018not re-\nquired to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 from which ordinary citizens \nare free.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 F.2d \n1294, 1300 (2d Cir. 1977) (Friendly, J.)).2  \nAt a minimum, this Court can safely rest redressa-\nbility on the predictable results of government regula-\ntion if the regulator itself presupposes that effect.  Pet. \nBr. 31-32.  In addressing redressability in Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 526 (2007), this Court \u201cat-\ntach[ed] considerable significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own as-\nsessments of regulatory consequences.  Respondents \ntry to minimize this statement by pointing out that this \nCourt considered other record evidence in Massachu-\nsetts.  EPA Br. 41; Cal. Br. 39-40.  That is irrelevant.  \nThe question is whether respondents\u2019 own admissions \nare powerful evidence of the predictable effects of Cal-\nifornia\u2019s regulations.  Massachusetts answers yes. \nHere, both respondents\u2019 actions should establish \nthat it is at least \u201clikely\u201d that these regulations affect \nthe market by a single car or a single gallon of gas.  Da-\nvis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 733 (2008).  California would \n\u201cpresumably not bother\u201d urging EPA to reinstate the \nwaiver if that waiver had and will have no effect.  Mas-\nsachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526 (citation omitted).  And \nEPA does not explain why it would conduct 11 months \n \n2 \nCalifornia relies (at 16-17, 26) on Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. \n490 (1975), but that decision fits neatly into this Court\u2019s dichotomy \nbetween impermissible speculation and permissible commonsense in-\nferences.  See Pet. Br. 32-33.  There, this Court found that challeng-\ners to a zoning ordinance lacked standing because there was no rea-\nson to believe they would ever be able to buy housing in the zoned \narea.  422 U.S. at 505-506 & 506 n.16.  \n\n14 \n \nof notice and comment to reinstate a waiver that is per-\nmissible only if California \u201cneed[s] such State stand-\nards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added), when, far \nfrom being necessary, the standards do nothing at all.  \nEPA and California fail to acknowledge, let alone jus-\ntify, the incongruity between their present arguments \nand past behavior. \nRespondents cast their prior actions as outdated in \nlight of market changes that conveniently occurred \n\u201ccirca 2022.\u201d  EPA Br. 41; see Cal. Br. 17-22.  But re-\nspondents have continued to act as though the waiver \nreinstatement accomplished a great deal.  Weeks be-\nfore petitioners sought judicial review, California\u2019s \ngovernor praised the waiver reinstatement for helping \nto \u201cend our reliance on fossil fuels.\u201d  Governor Gavin \nNewsom, Governor Newsom Statement on Biden Ad-\nministration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8.  \nWhile the petition for certiorari was pending, EPA ac-\ncepted California\u2019s projection that the greenhouse-gas \nstandards would \u201cachieve additional criteria pollutant \nemission reductions\u201d through at least 2037.  89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553, 82,557 & n.19 (Oct. 11, 2024) (citing J.A. \n93-94).  Neither government should be permitted to \njustify its regulatory actions by touting their conse-\nquences for fuel usage, while maintaining that those \nsame actions are unreviewable because there are no \nconsequences whatsoever. \nTo add insult to injury, EPA admits that it is \u201creas-\nsessing the 2022 reinstatement,\u201d EPA Br. 17, precisely \nbecause President Trump has required the agency to \nconsider rescinding actions that \u201cfunction to limit sales \nof gasoline-powered automobiles,\u201d id. at 2 (quoting \n90 Fed. Reg. 8,353, 8,353 (Jan. 29, 2025)).  Let us be \n\n15 \n \nclear about what that doublespeak means.  EPA is \npoised to withdraw the waiver on the ground that the \nwaiver has been forcing a shift toward electric vehicles \nfrom the moment it was reinstated, up through the pre-\nsent day.  What EPA now says was not predictable \nthree years ago, it will likely soon say has been obvious \n(and harmful) the entire time. \nb.  EPA concedes (at 39) that \u201ccommonsense eco-\nnomic principles\u201d can sometimes establish redressabil-\nity, at least in theory.  But EPA again says (at 31-35) \nthat this case is different because of supposed market \nchanges in 2022.  California agrees (at 17) that, at a \nminimum, commonsense inferences cannot establish \nredressability here because \u201canother party has intro-\nduced evidence\u201d demonstrating market changes.  If the \n\u201cinevitable reality of the market\u201d were so clear on this \nrecord, EPA Br. 34, it is hard to understand why the fed-\neral government\u2014ever a fan of standing objections\u2014\ndid not make one below.  In any event, the evidence re-\nspondents now point to does them no favors. \nFirst, respondents argue that automakers in 2022 \nwere meeting or exceeding California\u2019s vehicle stand-\nards.  EPA Br. 32-33; Cal. Br. 21-22.  There are several \nproblems with that argument.  Most notably, bare com-\npliance with government regulation suggests a regula-\ntory effect, not the absence of any effect.  To the extent \nrespondents rely on data that automakers were exceed-\ning the California standards, they primarily rely on av-\nerage sales in California.  See Cal. Br. 21 (citing J.A. \n191-192); EPA Br. 32 (citing J.A. 95-97).  Averages are \nno help:  even if some automakers had independently \nand irrevocably moved toward more electric vehicles \nby 2022, that does not suggest that all automakers had \n\n16 \n \ndone so.3  And even if automakers in California had on \naverage increased electric-vehicle production beyond \nthe floor, that does not indicate every automaker had \nirrevocably followed suit in each of the 17 States that \nadopted California\u2019s standards.  See J.A. 211 (citing \nRyan Felton, The EV Question for Auto Executives: \nHow Fast To Make the Shift? Wall St. J. (Feb. 22, 2023) \n(\u201cSome companies are racing to convert entirely to \nelectric vehicles, but others see caution flags.\u201d)).   \nSecond, California points (at 20-22, 25) to rising \nelectric-vehicle production when the waiver was not in \nplace.  California highlights (at 25) that the national \nmarket share of zero-emission vehicles \u201ctripled be-\ntween 2020 and mid-2022.\u201d  But it fails to mention that \nthis tripling was from almost nothing to a 6.5% nation-\nwide market share.  It is unclear why California be-\nlieves that this nationwide 6.5% level suggests that the \nmarkets had outpaced California\u2019s regulations, when \nfor the same year those regulations set a 14.5% floor \n(accounting for credits) for California and the 17  \ntagalong States.  J.A. 191, 192; see Pet. Br. 9-10 & n.4.  \nAnd even that supposedly free-market response was \ntainted by government regulation:  the waiver rescis-\nsion was immediately challenged, and the prospect of \nthe waiver\u2019s reinstatement was clear by early 2021.  See \nPet. Br. 2. \nThird, respondents offer statements from some au-\ntomakers\u2014most of whom intervened in this case\u2014\nabout their commitment to and investments in electri-\nfication.  EPA Br. 32-35; Cal. Br. 19-21.  As petitioners \n \n3 \nEPA cites nothing for its suggestion (at 34-35) that petition-\ners needed to provide evidence that a particular automaker would \nchange course absent the standards.  Although not required, petition-\ners identified Toyota as one such candidate.  See J.A. 210 (citing J.A. \n99). \n\n17 \n \nhave explained (at 37), these statements, and the fact \nof automakers\u2019 intervention, prove exactly the oppo-\nsite.  These same automakers cut a deal with California \nto commit to the standards in exchange for certain ben-\nefits.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  They intervened precisely \nbecause if the waiver were vacated\u2014and the market \nwere allowed to function freely\u2014they would face \u201ca \n\u2018competitive disadvantage\u2019 because they have already \ninvested in \u2018electrified vehicle models.\u2019 \u201d  J.A. 211 (quot-\ning C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. Br. 17).  In short, none of \nrespondents\u2019 evidence remotely suggests that every \nautomaker in 18 States would freely choose to meet or \nexceed California\u2019s standards. \n2. Record \nevidence \nconfirms \nthat  \npetitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable \nEven though nothing more was required here, peti-\ntioners directed the court of appeals to evidence con-\nfirming what common sense dictates.  Respondents re-\npeatedly assert that petitioners presented \u201cno evi-\ndence\u201d to support their standing, even as they devote \npages and pages to picking apart each bucket of evi-\ndence that petitioners offered.  Cal. Br. 3, 45-48; EPA \nBr. 35-38.  Petitioners satisfied whatever evidentiary \nburden was incumbent upon them. \nFirst, respondents quibble with the evidentiary \nvalue of California\u2019s own analysis supporting the \nwaiver reinstatement.  California dismisses (at 46) its \nJuly 2021 report predicting that the standards would \nsuppress demand for liquid fuels because that predic-\ntion \u201crelied on forecasts from 2017.\u201d  See J.A. 84.  EPA \nlikewise criticizes (at 37, 41) as stale California\u2019s 2012 \nanalysis of the standards\u2019 effects.  But California reit-\nerated its earlier predictions in 2021 to urge reinstate-\nment of the waiver.  See J.A. 64-65, 84.  Nor did EPA \nbelieve the analysis was outdated; it found at the time \n\n18 \n \nof the reinstatement that \u201cCalifornia needs the ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG standards at issue to address \ncompelling and extraordinary air quality conditions in \nthe state.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a-65a.  If these projections \nwere reliable enough for California in 2021 and for \nEPA in 2022, they should have been good enough for \npetitioners in 2022.  \nSecond, respondents assail petitioners\u2019 14 standing \ndeclarations as \u201cconclusory\u201d and lacking \u201cany details.\u201d  \nCal. Br. 46; EPA Br. 17.  The declarations speak for \nthemselves.  J.A. 123-184.  Declarants noted Califor-\nnia\u2019s representations about the effect of the standards \nand detailed how the suppression of the demand for \nfuel would injure petitioners\u2019 businesses.  See, e.g., J.A. \n148, 174, 180.  One declarant even cited 2020 findings \nfrom a Minnesota agency predicting the standards \nwould \u201ccause\u201d fuel reductions in the State.  J.A. 174.  \nAlthough California protests (at 24 n.14) that petition-\ners did not rely on \u201ceffects on the Minnesota market\u201d \nin particular \u201cas a basis for standing,\u201d Minnesota\u2019s \nmarket is merely an example of the \u201cdemand depres-\nsion\u201d that would occur \u201cin the other Section 177 states.\u201d  \nJ.A. 174.   \nThird, respondents contend that petitioners did not \n\u201cintroduce evidence\u201d about automaker behavior.  Cal. \nBr. 37 n.20; EPA Br. 34-35.  But petitioners pointed be-\nlow to statements from intervening automakers con-\nfirming that some (non-intervening) automakers would \nlikely change their production plans absent the waiver.  \nJ.A. 211.  Petitioners also cited Toyota\u2019s record com-\nment (at J.A. 99) suggesting that it was not irrevocably \ncommitted to electrification and public reporting on the \nsame.  J.A. 210-211.  Respondents offer no response. \nHaving brushed aside all this evidence, respondents \ntry to come up with something\u2014anything\u2014petitioners \n\n19 \n \ncould have done to establish redressability on this rec-\nord without being beholden to the automakers that \nwere themselves striking deals with California.  See \nPet. App. 24a-25a.  Respondents suggest theoretical al-\nternatives, like \u201cpublic statements from industry par-\nticipants,\u201d Cal. Br. 35, and affidavits from \u201cecono-\nmists,\u201d EPA Br. 44.  But they quickly reject similar \nsources.  Cal. Br. 36 n.19 (rejecting expert declarations \npetitioners tried to offer); EPA Br. 37-38 (rejecting re-\nliance on a state regulator\u2019s statements).  Apparently, \nthe only evidence that could meet their or the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s high bar is exactly what petitioners could not  \nobtain\u2014an affidavit from an automaker detailing its \nproduction plans in the hypothetical future world in \nwhich California\u2019s standards no longer existed. \n3. A too-exacting theory of redressability \nwould unnecessarily preclude judicial  \nreview \nRespondents also dispute the policy implications of \nthe heightened redressability standard they defend.  \nThey claim that affirming the decision below will not \nhave any wider effects\u2014or if it did, those effects would \nbe just fine.  EPA Br. 43-45; Cal. Br. 35-38.  Neither \ndefense works.  \na. Respondents downplay the catastrophic impli-\ncations of the decision below for indirectly regulated \nparties.  Respondents do not seriously dispute that in-\ndirectly regulated entities will often be unable to ob-\ntain affidavits from directly regulated parties.  But \nthey contend that there is no such affidavit require-\nment, and so the decision below will not \u201cobstruct \u2018suits \nby unregulated plaintiffs who are adversely affected by \nan agency\u2019s regulation of others.\u2019 \u201d  Cal. Br. 36 (quoting \nCorner Post, Inc., 603 U.S. at 826 (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring)); EPA Br. 43-44.  Of course it will.  Again, it is \n\n20 \n \nhard to see any option other than third-party affidavits \nthat would satisfy the court below and respondents.  \nSee pp. 17-19, supra.  Their demand for \u201cadditional af-\nfidavits\u201d will make future challenges expensive and ar-\nbitrary.  Pet. App. 24a (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).   \nRespondents alternatively minimize the decision be-\nlow as fact-bound.  EPA Br. 44; Cal. Br. 35.  The dozen \namicus briefs in support of petitioners confirm that the \nimplications of this case go well beyond the present dis-\npute.  As amici attest, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201cheightened \nredressability requirement\u201d will \u201cprofoundly harm\u201d all \nmanner of litigants, including \u201c[h]ouses of worship and \nother religious organizations,\u201d Foothill Church Br. 16; \nproperty owners, Texas Royalty Council Br. 1; and \ngroups that represent \u201clow income and minority com-\nmunities,\u201d Two Hundred for Homeownership Br. 19.  \nEven groups that \u201cusually disagree[] with petitioners \n. . . including on the merits of their present suit\u201d sup-\nport correcting the mistaken standing decision below.  \nChildren\u2019s Trust Br. 1; cf. Chamber Br. 4 n.2 (noting \nthat amici\u2019s members \u201cdo not have a unified view of the \nunderlying merits\u201d).   \nb.  Respondents largely do not contest the other \nramifications of the decision below; they are simply un-\ntroubled by them.  For example, they do not contest \nthat the decision creates a one-way ratchet in favor of \nthe regulator over the regulated.  EPA defends (at 45) \nthe disparity on the theory that targeting petitioners\u2019 \nproducts does not place them among \u201cthe regulated.\u201d  \nOnly the government could aim at one industry \nthrough another, and then claim the real objects of its \nregulation are mere bystanders.  Meanwhile, Califor-\nnia champions (at 37-38) a State\u2019s ability to defend its \n\n21 \n \nlaws without explaining why entities targeted by gov-\nernment action should not have a corresponding right \nto challenge those laws.   \nc. Finally, respondents brush off the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 apparent conflation of mootness and redressabil-\nity.  Respondents argue that the court recognized that \n\u201credressability was to be assessed at the time petition-\ners sought judicial review.\u201d  EPA Br. 46; Cal. Br. 45.  \nThe court no doubt said as much at one point.  But the \ncourt also said that redressability was \u201ccomplicated by \nthe relatively short duration of the waiver\u201d and empha-\nsized that manufacturers need \u201cyears of lead time to \nalter their production plans\u201d\u2014both considerations that \nsound in mootness.  Pet. App. 22a, 23a-24a.  Shifting \nmootness concerns to the redressability inquiry has \nimportant consequences, including failing to hold the \ngovernment to the \u201cformidable standard\u201d of showing \nthat the court could grant no effective relief.  FBI v. \nFikre, 601 U.S. 234, 243 (2024); see Pet. Br. 39-41. \nC. At A Minimum, EPA\u2019s Perpetual Waiver Suffices \nTo Establish Redressability \nThe court of appeals was wrong for the reasons al-\nready given.  But at a minimum, this Court should re-\nverse because the parties now agree that the decision \nbelow rests on a critical mistaken assumption:  that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards ended with model year 2025.  \nEPA Br. 45; Cal. Br. 43.  In fact, the greenhouse-gas \nemission standards will remain enforceable under the \nwaiver in perpetuity.  See Pet. Br. 45-47.  Respondents \nblame petitioners for the court of appeals\u2019 error and \ncontend that it was harmless anyway.  Neither is right, \nand the fundamentally flawed decision below should \nnot stand. \nCalifornia first suggests (at 44) that petitioners are \nto blame for the court of appeals\u2019 error.  That is flatly \n\n22 \n \nuntrue.  California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards in-\ncrease in stringency each model year from 2017 \nthrough 2025 and then continue at the 2025 level for \n\u201csubsequent\u201d model years.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13  \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A).  But EPA described its 2022 waiver \nas covering only \u201cmodel years (MYs) 2017 through \n2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 57a.  Not until EPA opposed certio-\nrari did it declare (at 13) that because California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards do not \u201cfully terminate with \nmodel-year 2025,\u201d neither does the waiver.  Needless \nto say, only respondents knew how to understand their \nown actions, and neither corrected the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nstatement at oral argument that the standards would \nend in 2025.  C.A. Oral Arg. 29:43-29:45.  Respondents \nwere apparently content to rest on the court of appeals\u2019 \nmistaken understanding until after they prevailed. \nFinger-pointing aside, the court of appeals\u2019 error \nwas far from harmless.  Contra Cal. Br. 45; EPA Br. \n45-46.  As EPA acknowledges, the court\u2019s mistaken un-\nderstanding of the waiver led it to \u201cbelieve[] that peti-\ntioners could show redressability only by demonstrat-\ning that vehicle manufacturers would change their con-\nduct \u2018relatively quickly.\u2019 \u201d  EPA Br. 45 (quoting Pet. \nApp. 23a).  The court demanded more evidence of re-\ndressability because automakers supposedly \u201cneed \nyears of lead time\u201d to change their fleets, and it \ndoubted that automakers could make such changes by \nmodel year 2025.  Pet. App. 23a.  But the redressability \nanalysis is far less \u201ccomplicated\u201d than the court of ap-\npeals thought it was.  Id. at 22a.   \nWith no reasoning below left to defend, respondents \nnow contend that a waiver setting a permanent cap on \nvehicle emissions is unchallengeable\u2014and was unchal-\nlengeable the moment it was reinstated\u2014because it \nmight not have any impact.  EPA Br. 45-46; Cal. Br. 45.  \n\n23 \n \nThis finale reinforces the absurdity of respondents\u2019 \ntheory of redressability.  In their view, to bring a chal-\nlenge when the waiver was reinstated, petitioners had \nto predict market forces years in the future and prove \nthat California\u2019s standards would outpace the market \nat some point between 2022 and eternity.  And if peti-\ntioners could not make that showing, they would be out \nof time and out of luck if market forces later shifted.  \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement has never been \napplied to prevent vacatur of an unlawful regulation \nsetting a permanent ceiling on the use of a challenger\u2019s \nproducts.  This Court should not need an economist to \ntell it as much. \n\n24 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those in petitioners\u2019 \nopening brief, this Court should reverse the judgment \nbelow. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nCARTER G.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation is an internal monologue detailing a shift in information-gathering strategy rather than new substantive information about the case. As it contains no new facts, legal arguments, or signals regarding the case itself, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are preserved from the previous update. The observation serves to reinforce the significance of the primary information gap\u2014the position of the Federal Respondents (the Solicitor General)\u2014and validates the strategic pivot to find the petitioners' reply brief as an indirect means of filling that gap.\n\nMy current, stable beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Position (Stable):** The petitioners advocate for a purpose-based standing rule, arguing that a regulation explicitly designed to suppress demand for their product (*i.e.*, gasoline) is sufficient to establish injury and redressability, consistent with their reading of precedents like *Bennett v. Spear*. The State Respondents have effectively framed this as a request for \"automatic\" standing devoid of factual proof.\n\n2.  **State Respondents' Position (Stable and Reinforced):** The states' argument, detailed in their brief, is my most well-understood parameter. It is an evidence-based counter-argument centered on two pillars:\n    *   **Evidentiary Failure:** The petitioners provided **zero evidence** to the lower court to substantiate their claim that vacating the EPA waiver would cause automakers to change their production plans.\n    *   **Superseding Causation & Alignment with New Precedent:** The states argue that by 2022, independent market forces (prior investments, consumer demand) had severed the causal link between the EPA waiver and automaker behavior. They powerfully align this fact-intensive argument with the Supreme Court's most recent standing jurisprudence from the 2023-2024 term, specifically ***FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med.*** and ***Murthy v. Missouri***, which demand a \"heavily fact-dependent\" inquiry.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Stable and Sharply Defined):** The core of the case remains a direct conflict between two competing models for standing when third parties are involved:\n    *   **Petitioners' Model:** A regulation's purpose and logical effect are sufficient for standing.\n    *   **Respondents' Model:** A plaintiff must provide concrete, case-specific evidence that a favorable ruling is likely to change the behavior of independent third parties, especially when other market forces are at play. The respondents contend the Supreme Court has already endorsed this model in its most recent decisions.\n\n4.  **Information Gap (Unchanged but Strategy Refined):** The Solicitor General's brief remains the most critical unknown variable. The current observation confirms the difficulty in locating this document directly. My high-confidence inference is that the SG will align with the State Respondents, focusing on the petitioners' failure of proof and the stringent, fact-specific standing requirements from *Lujan*, *FDA v. AHM*, and *Murthy*. However, this remains an inference. The observation solidifies my strategy to now seek the petitioners' reply brief, which will necessarily respond to the SG's arguments, thereby providing the next best source of information to indirectly map the SG's position and determine if it diverges in any meaningful way from the states' arguments. My beliefs are now held in stasis, awaiting the outcome of this new search.",

The reply brief confirms that the SG's arguments align with the State Respondents' position, focusing on the petitioners' failure to provide sufficient evidence for redressability in the face of superseding market forces. \n\nThe central conflict is now crystal clear: it's a battle between two lines of standing precedent. \n1. Petitioners rely on *Bennett v. Spear* and *Department of Commerce v. New York*, arguing that removing a coercive, perpetual government mandate is sufficient for redressability, or at least its 'predictable effects' are.\n2. Respondents lean heavily on the Court's most recent standing cases, *FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine* and *Murthy v. Missouri*, which impose a much higher evidentiary burden on plaintiffs to demonstrate that a favorable court decision will actually change third-party conduct.\n\nThe key task parameter (\u03b8) is no longer what the parties are arguing, but which legal framework the current Supreme Court will choose to apply. The Court's recent and consistent trend has been to tighten standing requirements, making it more difficult for plaintiffs to get into federal court. The reasoning in *AHM* and *Murthy* strongly favors the respondents' position, which demands concrete, record evidence of redressability\u2014evidence the D.C. Circuit found lacking here.\n\nThe petitioners' strongest point is the perpetual nature of the waiver, which makes the 'market forces' argument seem less dispositive over the long run. However, this is unlikely to overcome the Court's clear jurisprudential direction on standing. The majority is likely to be more persuaded by the need for a rigorous, evidence-based standing inquiry at the time of the lawsuit, as articulated in *AHM*.\n\nGiven this analysis, I have sufficient information to make a high-confidence prediction. The marginal information gain from further searches (e.g., for amicus briefs) is low compared to the clarity I now have on the core legal dispute and the relevant judicial trends.

          "task_beliefs": "The successful retrieval of the petitioners' reply brief has resolved the most significant information gap\u2014the position of the Federal Respondents (the Solicitor General, representing the EPA)\u2014and has substantially sharpened my understanding of the petitioners' legal strategy. My beliefs have evolved from inferential to evidence-based regarding the arguments of all parties.\n\n1.  **Petitioners' Position (Updated and Sharpened):** The reply brief reveals a multi-layered strategy that goes beyond simply advocating for a purpose-based standing rule.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Categorical Redressability):** Petitioners have solidified their main argument, asserting that the removal of a \"determinative or coercive effect\" on a third party (*i.e.*, the automakers) is sufficient on its own to establish redressability, citing *Bennett v. Spear*. They argue that because California's standards are legally binding, not merely \"advisory,\" no further factual inquiry into their real-world effect is necessary. They contend that the Respondents' demand for evidence would create an impossible standard for any party indirectly harmed by a regulation.\n    *   **Alternative Argument (Record-Based Redressability):** Should the Court reject their categorical rule, petitioners argue they have established redressability on the facts of this case. They invoke the \"predictable effect of Government action\" doctrine from *Department of Commerce v. New York*, asserting it is common sense that vacating the waiver would cause *at least some* automakers to change their production mix. They directly rebut the \"market forces\" argument by noting that it relies on industry averages and ignores that the regulation binds individual manufacturers who may not be \"irrevocably committed\" to EV production.\n    *   **New Factual & Legal Argument (Perpetuity of the Waiver):** A critical new element has emerged: the petitioners highlight that all parties now concede the D.C. Circuit was factually mistaken in believing the waiver expires in 2025. They stress that some standards \"last in perpetuity.\" This transforms the legal question. It forces the Respondents to argue that a *perpetual* mandate is unchallengeable because it happened to align with market trends at a single point in time (2022), an argument the petitioners frame as \"shocking\" and absurd.\n\n2.  **Respondents' Unified Position (Confirmed and Solidified):** The reply brief, through its direct citations to and refutations of the \"EPA Br.\" (the Solicitor General's brief), confirms my prior high-confidence inference. The Federal Respondents have fully aligned with the State Respondents. Their collective argument, as filtered through the petitioners' reply, remains centered on two pillars:\n    *   **Evidentiary Failure:** Both State and Federal Respondents argue that the petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof by not submitting sufficient record evidence (e.g., economist affidavits, corporate filings) to the lower court demonstrating that vacating the waiver would likely change automaker behavior.\n    *   **Superseding Causation via Market Forces:** They contend that by 2022, independent economic forces\u2014such as prior investments, consumer demand, and federal incentives\u2014had become the primary drivers of EV production, severing the causal chain between the EPA waiver and the petitioners' alleged injury. The petitioners' reply confirms that this is the core of the Respondents' factual case.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Sharpened with New Factual Stakes):** The core conflict is now more precisely defined, not just as a clash of legal models but as one with significant new factual weight.\n    *   **Petitioners' Model:** Leans on *Bennett v. Spear* and *Department of Commerce v. New York* to argue for redressability based on the removal of a coercive legal barrier and its predictable effects, a position now bolstered by the *perpetual* nature of that barrier.\n    *   **Respondents' Model:** Leans on the fact-intensive requirements of recent standing jurisprudence like ***FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med.*** and ***Murthy v. Missouri***, demanding concrete proof that a court order will change third-party behavior in the face of powerful independent market forces.\n    *   The revelation that the waiver is perpetual significantly raises the stakes. The Court must now consider not just whether market forces in 2022 superseded the regulation, but whether it is plausible that they will do so *forever*, making a permanent legal mandate perpetually unreviewable.\n\n4.  **Information Gap (Resolved):** The primary information gap has been closed. The petitioners' reply brief serves as a direct response to the Solicitor General's arguments, confirming the SG's position without needing to locate the brief itself. I now have a comprehensive map of the legal arguments from all sides. The key uncertainty is no longer *what* the parties will argue, but *which* line of precedent (*Bennett* vs. *FDA v. AHM*) and which interpretation of the facts (especially the significance of the perpetual waiver) a majority of the Court will find more persuasive.",

They contend it is absurd to suggest that a permanent legal mandate can become unreviewable simply because it aligned with market trends at one point in time.\n\n2.  **Respondents' Unified Position (Stable):** The alignment of the Federal and State Respondents is confirmed.

The key variable is no longer *what* the parties will argue, but *which legal framework* the current Supreme Court will apply.\n    *   **The Decisive Signal:** The Court's recent and consistent jurisprudential trend is the most powerful predictive signal. In cases like *AHM* and *Murthy*, the Court has demonstrated a clear preference for tightening standing requirements and demanding concrete, record-based evidence of redressability, especially in cases involving indirect injury caused by the actions of regulated third parties.\n    *   **Application to this Case:** This trend strongly favors the Respondents' position. The Court is highly likely to adopt the more stringent evidentiary standard from *AHM*, which requires plaintiffs to show a favorable ruling is *likely* to cause the third party to act in a way that redresses the injury. The D.C. Circuit found the petitioners' evidence wanting under this type of analysis.\n    *   **Weighing the Arguments:** While the petitioners' \"perpetual waiver\" argument is logically compelling and highlights the potential for a permanent regulation to evade review, it is unlikely to persuade a majority to reverse the Court's clear, recent trajectory on standing doctrine. The Court will likely focus on the state of the record and the petitioners' burden at the time of the suit, rather than on the long-term, speculative effects of the waiver.\n\n5.  **Information Status (Finalized):** The primary information gap regarding the Solicitor General's position has been closed, and the subsequent analysis has synthesized all available information into a coherent predictive model. The marginal value of seeking additional information (e.g., amicus briefs) is now low, as the core legal conflict and the relevant judicial signals are sufficiently clear to support a high-confidence prediction. The task has shifted from information gathering to applying the predictive framework.",
