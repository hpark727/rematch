    "facts_of_the_case": "This case involves victims and family members of HAMAS terrorist attacks who sued BLOM Bank SAL for allegedly aiding HAMAS by providing financial services to customers affiliated with the terrorist organization. The plaintiffs brought their case under the Anti-Terrorism Act, as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), claiming BLOM Bank was liable for aiding and abetting terrorism through these financial services.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in January 2019, which the district court dismissed for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal but clarified that the district court had applied the wrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability under JASTA. The plaintiffs then returned to the district court and moved to vacate the dismissal and amend their complaint. The district court denied their motion, and the Second Circuit concluded that the district court had erred by not properly balancing the competing principles of judgment finality (Rule 60(b)) and liberal pleading standards (Rule 15(a)).",

This planning step significantly increases the expected value of all subsequent actions, making it highly informative for the task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): The strategy articulated is a cornerstone of effective SCOTUS prediction. Starting with the Petition for Certiorari to understand the petitioner's framing of the legal question, the circuit split, and the core arguments is a generalizable and highly efficient methodology. Formalizing this as a primary step refines the agent's overall design for tackling any new case, making this insight valuable beyond the current task.\n\nJoint EIG (1.3): The action provides significant value on both axes.

The new observation, while internal reasoning, provides the foundational structure for my understanding of the legal dispute. I now know that the central issue is a procedural conflict between two Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nSpecifically, the case hinges on the tension between:\n1.  **Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6):** This rule allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment for \"any other reason that justifies relief.\" It is generally interpreted as requiring a \"stringent standard\" and \"extraordinary circumstances\" to uphold the important principle of judgment finality.\n2.  **Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a):** This rule states that courts should \"freely give leave\" for a party to amend their pleadings \"when justice so requires,\" reflecting a policy of resolving cases on their merits rather than on technical pleading defects.\n\nThe conflict arises in a specific procedural context: a plaintiff whose case was dismissed seeks to vacate that judgment and amend their complaint *after* an appellate court has clarified the correct legal standard that should have been applied. The Second Circuit ruled that the district court must balance the principles of both rules.\n\nTherefore, my prediction must now focus on how the Supreme Court is likely to resolve this conflict. Key factors will include the Court's general disposition towards finality of judgments versus liberal pleading standards, and whether an intervening clarification of law by an appellate court constitutes an \"extraordinary circumstance\" under Rule 60(b)(6) sufficient to justify reopening a final judgment to permit an amendment under Rule 15(a).

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs.

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 and reproduced at Pet.App.54-87.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 1:07-cv-00916-DLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Beer v. ASSA \nCorp., No. 1:13-cv-01848-LAP (S.D.N.Y.); Singer v. Bank of \nPalestine, No. 1:19-cv-00006-ENV-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Averbach v. \nCairo Amman Bank, No. 1:19-cv-00004-GHW-KHP (S.D.N.Y.); \nMiller v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. 1:19-cv-00002-DLI-RML \n(E.D.N.Y.); Miller v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, PLC, 1:19-cv-00001-\nDLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Spetner v. Palestine Inv. Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U.

Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 \nF.3d 536, 540 (4th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Pe\u00f1a v. \nMattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996); Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 509 (1st Cir. 2009).  The \nmatter is closed, the claim is \u201cextinguishe[d],\u201d and res \njudicata generally \u201cbar[s] a subsequent action on that \nclaim.\u201d  Cooper v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 916 (2009).   \nB. Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm. Moore et \nal., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.48[3][b] (3d ed. \n2024).  A party that is even \u201cpartly to blame for the \ndelay\u201d cannot obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393. \nThat requirement fits neatly within the broader \ncontext of Rule 60(b).  After all, Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533.  That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.

The observation confirms that the petition for a writ of certiorari\u2014which contains the petitioner's core legal arguments\u2014is a critical but still-missing piece of information.\n\nMy belief state is therefore preserved from the prior step. The central conflict remains the procedural tension between the finality of judgments under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) and the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a). The specific context is a post-judgment motion to amend following an appellate court's clarification of the governing legal standard.\n\nThe core of my predictive model is still focused on how the Supreme Court will resolve the Second Circuit's \"balancing test\" approach. The key questions are:\n1.  Is it appropriate to balance the \"stringent standard\" of Rule 60(b)(6) against the \"freely give leave\" principle of Rule 15(a)?\n2.  Or, must Rule 60(b)(6)'s standard be met independently before a court can even consider a Rule 15(a) motion post-judgment?\n3.  Does an intervening clarification of law by an appellate court, which reveals that the initial dismissal was based on an incorrect legal standard, constitute the \"extraordinary circumstances\" required to grant relief under Rule 60(b)(6)?\n\nThe recent observation did not alter these parameters but reinforced the high value of obtaining the petitioner's arguments. My ability to predict the outcome remains contingent on understanding precisely why BLOM Bank argues the Second Circuit's balancing act is legally erroneous.

          "task_beliefs": "My previous understanding of the central conflict between the finality of judgments under Rule 60(b)(6) and the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a) is now substantially sharpened by the receipt of the Petitioner's (BLOM Bank's) merits brief. This observation provides the specific legal architecture for the petitioner's case, moving my belief state from a general understanding of the legal tension to a detailed model of the arguments the Justices will evaluate.\n\nMy prior belief that the core issue was the validity of the Second Circuit's \"balancing test\" is confirmed and amplified. The Petitioner's brief directly attacks this test as an \"anomalous,\" \"atextual,\" and \"outlier\" approach. My model of the case is updated with the following specific arguments and legal signals from the petitioner:\n\n1.  **Sequential, Not Concurrent, Application of Rules:** The petitioner's primary argument is that Rule 60(b) and Rule 15(a) operate sequentially, not in tandem. A party must *first* satisfy the \"stringent standard\" of Rule 60(b) to reopen a final judgment. Only *after* the judgment is vacated can the court consider a motion to amend under Rule 15(a)'s more liberal standard. This directly answers one of my key predictive questions: the petitioner argues against balancing and for a strict, two-step procedural gate.\n\n2.  **Emphasis on \"Extraordinary Circumstances\" and \"Faultless\" Movant:** The petitioner's case rests heavily on established Supreme Court precedent for Rule 60(b)(6). They repeatedly cite *Gonzalez v. Crosby* for the \"extraordinary circumstances\" requirement and *Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship* and *Ackermann v. United States* for the principle that the moving party must be \"faultless\" and that \"free, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved from.\" This refines my understanding of how the petitioner will frame the facts: they will argue the respondents were not \"faultless\" because they made a \"deliberate choice\" not to amend their complaint pre-judgment despite having \"multiple invitations and opportunities.\"\n\n3.  **Framing the Second Circuit as an Outlier:** A crucial new piece of information for my predictive model is the petitioner's characterization of the Second Circuit's rule as being in conflict with other circuits. They strategically cite a recent Fourth Circuit case, *Daulatzai v. Maryland* (2024), which explicitly rejected a balancing approach. This allows the petitioner to argue that the Supreme Court's intervention is necessary to correct an anomaly and restore national uniformity, a powerful motivator for the Court.\n\n4.  **Textual and Structural Arguments:** The petitioner argues that the Second Circuit's test is \"atextual\" and undermines the structure of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They contend that if Rule 15(a)'s liberality could override Rule 60(b)'s finality, the strict requirements for post-judgment relief would be rendered meaningless, particularly the one-year time limit for motions under Rule 60(b)(1) based on mistake or excusable neglect.\n\nMy predictive model is now significantly more detailed. I can see that the petitioner is presenting the Court with a choice between a clear, textually-grounded, sequential rule that prioritizes finality (their position) and a flexible, atextual balancing test that they argue creates uncertainty and rewards strategic delay (the Second Circuit's position). The petitioner's arguments based on finality, textualism, and circuit uniformity are often persuasive to the current Court. My confidence in a potential prediction favoring the petitioner has increased, but it remains contingent on the strength of the respondents' counterarguments, which are now the most critical missing piece of evidence.",

My predictive model is currently one-sided and 'capped' in its confidence. This action directly targets and resolves this fundamental information deficit by seeking the Respondents' merits brief. Therefore, the Task EIG is maximal (1.0) because it is the single most critical piece of evidence needed to build a complete and balanced legal architecture of the case, allowing for a meaningful prediction. The Design EIG is also high (0.7) because analyzing how the Respondents counter the Petitioner's textual, precedential, and circuit-split arguments provides valuable, generalizable data on effective rebuttal strategies in procedural cases. This reinforces and refines the core design principle that a complete predictive model requires a thorough understanding of both parties' primary arguments. My confidence is maximal (1.0) as the action's value is directly stated and logically necessary given the current state.",

The beliefs are very coherent and well-integrated, with no contradictions and a clear, structured mental model (coherence = 0.95). The information density is very high, as the agent captures rich legal detail, precedent citations, procedural nuances, and strategic framing, though it is limited to one side of the case (information_density = 0.9).

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F.

Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30.

Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v.

The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v.

Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue summarizing my current state of knowledge, does not introduce new external facts or legal arguments about the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) regarding the legal architecture of the case remain stable and are reinforced by this self-assessment. The observation confirms that my understanding of the Petitioner's arguments is solid and that the most critical missing piece of evidence for my predictive model is the Respondents' counterargument.\n\nMy current, stable understanding of the case is built upon the Petitioner's (BLOM Bank's) merits brief and is now structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in Sequential Application:** My belief that the Petitioner's core argument is a strict, sequential application of the Federal Rules is unchanged. They argue that a party must *first* satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)'s \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard to reopen a final judgment. Only then can the liberal amendment standard of Rule 15(a) be considered. This procedural gatekeeper model stands in direct opposition to the Second Circuit's balancing test.\n\n2.  **Stable Belief in Precedent-Based Framing:** My understanding of the Petitioner's reliance on precedent is firm. They ground their case in the high bar set by *Gonzalez v. Crosby* (\"extraordinary circumstances\") and *Ackermann v. United States* (the movant cannot be relieved from \"free, calculated, deliberate choices\"). This confirms my model's prediction that the Petitioner will factually frame the Respondents' failure to amend pre-judgment not as a mistake, but as a \"deliberate choice\" that disqualifies them from Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n\n3.  **Stable Belief in the \"Circuit Split\" Narrative:** The Petitioner's strategy of portraying the Second Circuit as an \"anomalous\" outlier, especially by citing the Fourth Circuit's contrary holding in *Daulatzai v. Maryland*, remains a key component of my belief state. This argument provides the Supreme Court with a strong institutional reason to rule for the Petitioner\u2014to restore national uniformity in federal procedure.\n\n4.  **Stable Belief in Textualist Arguments:** The Petitioner's textual and structural arguments\u2014that the Second Circuit's test is \"atextual\" and effectively nullifies the strictures of Rule 60(b)\u2014continue to be a central feature of my model. These arguments are likely to be persuasive to members of the Court who prioritize the plain text and overall structure of the Federal Rules.\n\nThe primary effect of this observation is not to add new factual data, but to confirm the current state of my predictive model and to sharpen my focus on the remaining uncertainty. My model is currently asymmetrical, reflecting only the Petitioner's side. The observation correctly identifies that my confidence in any prediction is capped until I can incorporate the legal architecture of the Respondents' defense. The next essential piece of evidence is the Respondents' merits brief, which will reveal how they justify the balancing test, rebut the \"deliberate choice\" narrative, and frame the equities of their situation.",

The Respondents argue for an inherent balancing test within Rule 60(b)(6), where the 'extraordinary circumstance' is the judicial clarification of a previously incorrect legal standard, denying them a meaningful opportunity to amend. To further refine my prediction, I need to see how the Petitioner responds to the Respondents' specific arguments. The Petitioner's reply brief is the most direct source for this information, as it will attempt to rebut the 'inherent balancing' and 'no meaningful opportunity' claims. This will complete the primary briefing cycle and crystallize the exact legal disagreements the Court must resolve. Therefore, my next action will be to search for the Petitioner's reply brief.",

The action's value lies more in validating the agent's strategic approach than in directly advancing the specific prediction.",

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model has been substantially updated by the introduction of the Respondents' merits brief, moving from a one-sided understanding based on the Petitioner's arguments to a more complete, adversarial model of the legal questions at stake. My prior beliefs, derived from the Petitioner's brief, remain stable as an accurate representation of one side of the argument, but they are now contextualized and directly challenged by the Respondents' counter-narrative.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in Petitioner's Sequential Framework:** My understanding of the Petitioner's (BLOM Bank's) core argument remains unchanged. They advocate for a rigid, two-step procedural sequence: a movant must *first* independently satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)'s \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard to reopen a final judgment, and only *then* can the court consider a motion to amend under Rule 15(a)'s liberal standard. This procedural gatekeeper model, grounded in precedents like *Gonzalez v. Crosby* and *Ackermann v. United States*, frames the Respondents' failure to amend pre-judgment as a \"free, calculated, deliberate choice\" that forecloses relief. The Petitioner's strategy of highlighting a circuit split by contrasting the Second Circuit with the Fourth Circuit's holding in *Daulatzai v. Maryland* also remains a key, stable component of their case, designed to appeal to the Court's interest in procedural uniformity.\n\n2.  **New Belief - The Respondents' \"Inherent Balancing\" Counter-Framework:** The Respondents' brief introduces a powerful counter-argument that fundamentally reframes the debate. They argue that the Second Circuit did not \"abandon\" the \"extraordinary circumstances\" test but rather engaged in a balancing act that is *inherent* to Rule 60(b)(6) jurisprudence. Citing cases like *Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White* (3d Cir.), they contend that the very purpose of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" requirement is to balance the rule's broad equitable power with the interest in finality. Furthermore, they invoke Supreme Court precedent like *Krupski v. Costa Crociere* to argue that this balancing must also account for the strong preference in the Federal Rules for resolving cases on their merits. This recasts the Second Circuit's decision not as an anomalous departure, but as a conventional application of equitable principles embedded within the rule itself.\n\n3.  **Evolved Belief - The \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative is Now Contested:** My previous understanding of the Respondents' actions as a potential \"deliberate choice\" is now significantly more nuanced. The Respondents directly rebut this characterization by arguing their decision not to amend was a reasonable response to the district court applying the \"wrong legal standard\" for JASTA liability and an \"impossibly exacting\" standard for pleading knowledge. They assert that they had no *meaningful* opportunity to amend because any amendment would have been futile against the incorrect and insurmountable legal barrier erected by the district court. This argument seeks to distinguish their case from *Ackermann* by claiming their choice was not a \"free, calculated\" waiver but a forced reaction to judicial error. The factual and equitable dispute over whether the opportunity to amend was \"meaningful\" has now become a central pivot point of the case.\n\n4.  **Evolved Belief - The \"Circuit Split\" is Muddled:** The Respondents actively work to dissolve the clean circuit split narrative promoted by the Petitioner. They argue that there is a broad, national consensus among circuits favoring at least one meaningful opportunity to amend a complaint, often *after* a court has identified remediable defects in a dismissal order. By citing a wide array of cases from numerous circuits, they portray the Second Circuit's action as being in the mainstream of federal practice, with the only unusual feature being that the clarification of pleading standards came from an appellate court rather than the district court. This challenges the institutional imperative for the Supreme Court to reverse in the name of uniformity, suggesting instead that a ruling for the Petitioner would be the true departure from common practice.\n\n5.  **New Belief - The \"Extraordinary Circumstance\" is Defined by Judicial Error and Clarification:** The Respondents have crystallized their theory of what constitutes the \"extraordinary circumstance\" in their specific case. It is the unique combination of: (1) the district court dismissing the complaint based on multiple, incorrect legal standards; (2) the appellate court subsequently correcting those errors and \"clarifying\" the proper pleading requirements for the first time; and (3) the plaintiffs having never been given a chance to amend their complaint to meet the *correct* legal standard. This narrative transforms the case from one about lax procedural standards to one about ensuring fairness and access to the merits in the face of judicial error.\n\nMy predictive model is now balanced. The key uncertainty has shifted from \"what will the Respondents argue?\" to \"which of these two competing frameworks will the Court find more persuasive?\" The outcome will likely depend on whether the Court prioritizes the Petitioner's clean, textual, sequentialist view of the Rules or the Respondents' more holistic, equitable view that emphasizes the Rules' overall purpose of achieving justice on the merits, particularly in light of a lower court's legal error.",

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 1:07-cv-00916-DLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Beer v. ASSA \nCorp., No. 1:13-cv-01848-LAP (S.D.N.Y.); Singer v. Bank of \nPalestine, No. 1:19-cv-00006-ENV-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Averbach v. \nCairo Amman Bank, No. 1:19-cv-00004-GHW-KHP (S.D.N.Y.); \nMiller v.

Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v.

Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v.

Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm.

That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal thought process, a meta-level reflection on my current belief state and a plan for future information gathering. It did not introduce any new external facts, arguments, or evidence about the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, preserving the comprehensive, balanced model developed after analyzing the Respondents' merits brief.\n\nMy current predictive model is founded on the central conflict between two competing legal frameworks, and my beliefs about them are unchanged:\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in Petitioner's Sequential Framework:** My understanding of the Petitioner's (BLOM Bank's) core argument remains unchanged. They advocate for a rigid, two-step procedural sequence: a movant must *first* independently satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)'s \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard to reopen a final judgment, and only *then* can the court consider a motion to amend under Rule 15(a)'s liberal standard. This procedural gatekeeper model, grounded in precedents like *Gonzalez v. Crosby* and *Ackermann v. United States*, frames the Respondents' failure to amend pre-judgment as a \"free, calculated, deliberate choice\" that forecloses relief. The Petitioner's strategy of highlighting a circuit split by contrasting the Second Circuit with the Fourth Circuit's holding in *Daulatzai v. Maryland* also remains a key, stable component of their case, designed to appeal to the Court's interest in procedural uniformity.\n\n2.  **Stable Belief in Respondents' \"Inherent Balancing\" Counter-Framework:** The Respondents' brief introduced a powerful counter-argument that fundamentally reframes the debate. They argue that the Second Circuit did not \"abandon\" the \"extraordinary circumstances\" test but rather engaged in a balancing act that is *inherent* to Rule 60(b)(6) jurisprudence. Citing cases like *Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White* (3d Cir.), they contend that the very purpose of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" requirement is to balance the rule's broad equitable power with the interest in finality. Furthermore, they invoke Supreme Court precedent like *Krupski v. Costa Crociere* to argue that this balancing must also account for the strong preference in the Federal Rules for resolving cases on their merits. This recasts the Second Circuit's decision not as an anomalous departure, but as a conventional application of equitable principles embedded within the rule itself.\n\n3.  **Stable (but Contested) Understanding of the \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative:** My understanding of the Respondents' actions as a potential \"deliberate choice\" is now significantly more nuanced and contested. The Respondents directly rebut this characterization by arguing their decision not to amend was a reasonable response to the district court applying the \"wrong legal standard\" for JASTA liability and an \"impossibly exacting\" standard for pleading knowledge. They assert that they had no *meaningful* opportunity to amend because any amendment would have been futile against the incorrect and insurmountable legal barrier erected by the district court. This argument seeks to distinguish their case from *Ackermann* by claiming their choice was not a \"free, calculated\" waiver but a forced reaction to judicial error. The factual and equitable dispute over whether the opportunity to amend was \"meaningful\" remains a central pivot point of the case.\n\n4.  **Stable (but Contested) Understanding of the \"Circuit Split\":** The Respondents actively work to dissolve the clean circuit split narrative promoted by the Petitioner. They argue that there is a broad, national consensus among circuits favoring at least one meaningful opportunity to amend a complaint, often *after* a court has identified remediable defects in a dismissal order. By citing a wide array of cases from numerous circuits, they portray the Second Circuit's action as being in the mainstream of federal practice. This challenges the institutional imperative for the Supreme Court to reverse in the name of uniformity, suggesting instead that a ruling for the Petitioner would be the true departure from common practice.\n\n5.  **Stable Belief in Respondents' Definition of \"Extraordinary Circumstance\":** The Respondents have crystallized their theory of what constitutes the \"extraordinary circumstance\" in their specific case. It is the unique combination of: (1) the district court dismissing the complaint based on multiple, incorrect legal standards; (2) the appellate court subsequently correcting those errors and \"clarifying\" the proper pleading requirements for the first time; and (3) the plaintiffs having never been given a chance to amend their complaint to meet the *correct* legal standard. This narrative transforms the case from one about lax procedural standards to one about ensuring fairness and access to the merits in the face of judicial error.\n\nIn summary, my belief state is unchanged. The core uncertainty remains which of these two competing frameworks\u2014the Petitioner's clean, textual, sequentialist view of the Rules or the Respondents' more holistic, equitable view\u2014the Court will find more persuasive. My predictive model is stable and awaits new information, such as the Petitioner's reply brief, to see how the Petitioner directly rebuts the Respondents' counter-arguments.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, while resulting from a search for the Petitioner's *reply* brief, returned the Petitioner's *opening* merits brief. This document does not introduce new arguments that post-date the Respondents' brief; rather, it provides the primary source text for the Petitioner's initial arguments, which my previous belief state had already modeled. Therefore, this observation serves to confirm, reinforce, and add specific textual granularity to my understanding of the Petitioner's position, but it does not fundamentally alter the core conflict or the balance of arguments in the case. My predictive model remains stable, but my confidence in the characterization of the Petitioner's framework is now higher and more detailed.\n\n1.  **Reinforced Belief in Petitioner's Sequential Framework:** My understanding of the Petitioner's rigid, two-step procedural argument is now confirmed by the direct text of their brief. They explicitly argue that \"if a plaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in order to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy one of the Rule 60(b) grounds\" and have the judgment set aside \"*before* a court may consider her motion to amend.\" They label the Second Circuit's approach an \"outlier balancing test\" that is \"atextual,\" \"indefensible,\" and improperly \"collaps[es] the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\" This confirms their strategy is to present the Court with a clean, textualist, and sequential interpretation of the rules, where Rule 60(b) acts as a formidable gatekeeper to post-judgment amendments.\n\n2.  **Stable Belief in Respondents' \"Inherent Balancing\" Counter-Framework:** The Petitioner's brief, having been filed first, does not and cannot rebut the Respondents' core argument that the \"extraordinary circumstances\" test *inherently* involves balancing equitable considerations. Therefore, my belief in the power of the Respondents' counter-narrative\u2014which reframes the Second Circuit's decision as a conventional application of equity rather than a radical departure\u2014remains stable and unchallenged by this new observation. The central tension of the case persists.\n\n3.  **Reinforced Understanding of the \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative:** The Petitioner's brief provides the direct textual basis for their characterization of the Respondents' conduct. They state, \"Respondents declined multiple invitations and opportunities to amend their complaint\" and made a \"deliberate choice[]... to proceed on that complaint as pled and take their chances on a motion to dismiss.\" They lean heavily on *Ackermann v. United States*, arguing, \"free, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved from.\" This observation solidifies my understanding that a key pillar of the Petitioner's case is portraying the Respondents as litigants who strategically gambled and lost, and are therefore not \"faultless\" as required for Rule 60(b)(6) relief under precedents like *Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co.* This sets up a direct clash with the Respondents' rebuttal that their choice was not \"meaningful\" due to the district court's application of an incorrect legal standard.\n\n4.  **Reinforced Understanding of the \"Circuit Split\" Argument:** The Petitioner's brief confirms their strategy of leveraging a circuit split to attract the Supreme Court's interest in ensuring procedural uniformity. They explicitly praise the Fourth Circuit's recent decision in *Daulatzai v. Maryland*, quoting it for the proposition that adopting the Second Circuit's rule would place a court \"alone in the Nation.\" This confirms that Petitioner is framing this not just as a case about one plaintiff, but about resolving a deep, national division in procedural practice, an argument designed to appeal to the Court's institutional role. This remains in direct conflict with my stable belief that the Respondents have attempted to dissolve this narrative by citing a broader consensus.\n\n5.  **Stable Belief in Respondents' Definition of \"Extraordinary Circumstance\":** The Petitioner's brief argues that a subsequent appellate clarification of the law is *not* an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to reopen a judgment. This argument does not, however, directly address the Respondents' more nuanced formulation: that the extraordinary circumstance is the *combination* of judicial error, subsequent clarification, and the lack of any prior opportunity to amend under the *correct* standard. My belief in the potential persuasiveness of the Respondents' specific definition remains stable.\n\nIn summary, the observation has provided a high-fidelity confirmation of the Petitioner's opening arguments, grounding my prior beliefs in their specific textual and rhetorical choices. It sharpens my understanding of their reliance on finality, the \"deliberate choice\" narrative from *Ackermann*, and the \"faultless\" standard from *Pioneer*. However, because this was the opening brief, it does not engage with the Respondents' counter-arguments. The core uncertainty remains exactly where it was: which of these two well-defined, competing legal frameworks\u2014the Petitioner's rigid sequentialism focused on finality, or the Respondents' holistic, equitable balancing focused on reaching the merits\u2014will command a majority of the Court. The most informative future observation remains the Petitioner's reply brief, which must directly confront the Respondents' powerful counter-narrative.",

This observation contains no new external facts, legal arguments, or signals related to the case of *BLOM Bank SAL v. Honickman*. As such, it does not alter the substantive content of my beliefs about the case's legal landscape. My entire previous belief state is preserved, and the core uncertainties remain unchanged.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Central Procedural Conflict:** My understanding of the case's core tension remains stable. The conflict is between two competing interpretations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n    *   **Petitioner's Framework (Confirmed & Stable):** The Petitioner advocates for a rigid, sequential, and textualist application of the rules. Their confirmed position is that a litigant must first satisfy the stringent \"extraordinary circumstances\" test of Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment *before* the court can even consider the liberal amendment standard of Rule 15(a). This framework prioritizes the finality of judgments.\n    *   **Respondents' Framework (Stable):** The Respondents argue for a more holistic and equitable approach, contending that the \"extraordinary circumstances\" analysis under Rule 60(b)(6) inherently involves balancing factors, including the merits of the proposed amendment and the pursuit of justice, effectively blending the considerations of the two rules.\n\n2.  **Stable Understanding of Competing Narratives:** The key narratives deployed by each side remain in direct opposition, and my understanding of them is unchanged.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative (Confirmed & Stable):** My belief, confirmed by the Petitioner's opening brief, is that they are framing the Respondents as litigants who made a \"free, calculated, deliberate choice\" (*Ackermann v. United States*) to stand on their initial complaint. By gambling and losing, they are not \"faultless\" (*Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co.*) and thus are undeserving of equitable relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\n    *   **Respondents' \"No Meaningful Opportunity\" Narrative (Stable):** This remains the primary counter-argument. The Respondents' position is that their choice was not truly \"meaningful\" because the district court applied the wrong, and subsequently clarified, legal standard. They argue the extraordinary circumstance is the unique combination of this judicial error and the lack of a prior chance to amend under the correct legal framework.\n\n3.  **Stable View on the Circuit Split Framing:** My belief about how each party frames the existing disagreement among the Courts of Appeals is stable.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deep National Division\" Argument (Confirmed & Stable):** The Petitioner explicitly leverages the circuit split, portraying the Second Circuit's balancing test as an \"outlier\" and emphasizing the need for national uniformity\u2014a classic appeal to the Supreme Court's institutional role.\n    *   **Respondents' \"Broader Consensus\" Argument (Stable):** The Respondents' counter-strategy of reframing the Second Circuit's test as part of a broader, more nuanced consensus on applying equity in Rule 60(b)(6) situations remains a key part of their case.\n\nIn summary, the latest observation was purely procedural and internal, providing no new information about the case itself. My belief state is therefore unchanged. The central uncertainty remains precisely where it was: how the Petitioner, in their reply brief, will dismantle the Respondents' powerful counter-arguments that Rule 60(b)(6) inherently involves balancing and that their failure to amend was not a \"meaningful\" strategic choice. The observation underscores that the Petitioner's reply brief is the single most informative piece of evidence needed to update my predictive model.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a second, consecutive failed attempt to locate the Petitioner's reply brief through a docket search. This observation, like the one immediately preceding it, is purely procedural and yields no new substantive information about the case's legal arguments, facts, or signals from the parties. Consequently, it does not alter the content of my beliefs, but rather reinforces the stability of my existing understanding and highlights the persistent information gap. My entire previous belief state is preserved.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Central Procedural Conflict:** My understanding of the case's core tension between two interpretations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure remains unchanged and stable.\n    *   **Petitioner's Framework (Confirmed & Stable):** The Petitioner's confirmed position is that a litigant must first satisfy the stringent \"extraordinary circumstances\" test of Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment *before* the court can consider the liberal amendment standard of Rule 15(a). This textualist, sequential approach prioritizes the finality of judgments.\n    *   **Respondents' Framework (Stable):** The Respondents argue for a more holistic, equitable approach, contending that the \"extraordinary circumstances\" analysis under Rule 60(b)(6) inherently involves balancing factors, including the merits of the proposed amendment and the pursuit of justice, effectively blending the considerations of the two rules.\n\n2.  **Stable Understanding of Competing Narratives:** The key narratives deployed by each side remain in direct opposition, and my understanding of them is unchanged.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative (Confirmed & Stable):** My belief, confirmed by the Petitioner's opening brief, is that they are framing the Respondents as litigants who made a \"free, calculated, deliberate choice\" (*Ackermann v. United States*) to stand on their initial complaint. By gambling and losing, they are not \"faultless\" (*Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co.*) and thus are undeserving of equitable relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\n    *   **Respondents' \"No Meaningful Opportunity\" Narrative (Stable):** This remains the primary counter-argument. The Respondents' position is that their choice was not truly \"meaningful\" because the district court applied the wrong legal standard, which was only clarified later on appeal. They argue the extraordinary circumstance is the unique combination of this judicial error and the lack of a prior chance to amend under the correct legal framework.\n\n3.  **Stable View on the Circuit Split Framing:** My belief about how each party frames the existing disagreement among the Courts of Appeals is stable.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deep National Division\" Argument (Confirmed & Stable):** The Petitioner explicitly leverages the circuit split, portraying the Second Circuit's balancing test as an \"outlier\" and emphasizing the need for national uniformity\u2014a classic appeal to the Supreme Court's institutional role.\n    *   **Respondents' \"Broader Consensus\" Argument (Stable):** The Respondents' counter-strategy of reframing the Second Circuit's test as part of a broader, more nuanced consensus on applying equity in Rule 60(b)(6) situations remains a key part of their case.\n\nIn summary, this repeated null-result observation provides no new information. My belief state is therefore unchanged. The central uncertainty remains precisely where it was: how the Petitioner, in their reply brief, will dismantle the Respondents' powerful counter-arguments that Rule 60(b)(6) inherently involves balancing and that their failure to amend was not a \"meaningful\" strategic choice. The repeated failure to find this document only underscores its critical importance as the single most informative piece of evidence needed to update my predictive model.",

BLOM BANK \naided and abetted the Islamic Resistance Movement \n(\u201cHAMAS\u201d), a Foreign Terrorist Organization (\u201cFTO\u201d) \n(as that term is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 1189 of the \nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d)) by knowingly providing substantial assistance \nto HAMAS in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d) of the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), and is civilly liable under \u00a7\u00a02333(d) \nof the ATA to those American citizens (and their estates, \nsurvivors and heirs) who have been killed or injured in \ntheir person, property or business by reason of such acts \nof international terrorism perpetrated by HAMAS.\n2. BLOM BANK knowingly \u2013 and with awareness of \nits important role \u2013 provided financial services to HAMAS \nin several related ways set forth below, by maintaining \naccounts for, and facilitating substantial payments on \nbehalf of, HAMAS\u2019s Lebanese institutions, most notably \nthe Sanabil Association for Relief and Development \n(\u201cSanabil\u201d), which was designated by the U.S. Department \nof the Treasury as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist \n(\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003.\n\nAppendix A\n5a\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over \nthis civil action brought by citizens of the United States \nwho have been killed or injured by reason of acts of \ninternational terrorism, and/or their estates, survivors, \nand heirs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01331 and 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a02333(a), 2333(d), and 2338.\n4. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a02334(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01391(b).\n5. BLOM BANK is subject to personal jurisdiction \nin New York pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 2334(a), N.Y. \nCPLR \u00a7\u00a0302, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)-(2) because it \nhas transacted business during the relevant period and \ncommitted tortious acts within the United States during \nthe relevant period by transferring funds through the \nUnited States for the benefit of HAMAS.\n6. As set forth below, BLOM BANK purposefully used \nits multiple correspondent bank accounts at U.S. financial \ninstitutions, including its accounts at Bank of New York, \nCitibank NA and American Express Bank Ltd. in New \nYork to provide financial services to HAMAS, including \nfacilitating the transfer of millions of U.S. dollars through \nthe United States on HAMAS\u2019s behalf or for HAMAS\u2019s \nbenefit.\n\nAppendix A\n6a\nTHE PARTIES\nA. \t The Plaintiffs\n7. The Second Intifada (\u201cal-Quds\u201d or \u201cal-Aqsa \nIntifada\u201d), which broke out in Israel and the Palestinian \nTerritories in September 2000, was a key turning point \nin HAMAS\u2019s history.\n8. In the initial weeks of the Second Intifada, large \ndemonstrations were organized in several Palestinian \ncities. On October 12, 2000, a Palestinian mob in Ramallah \nattacked two off- duty Israeli reservists, lynched them, \nand celebrated their deaths \u2013 with much of the scene \ncaptured on camera.\n9. Soon thereafter, HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic \nJihad (\u201cPIJ\u201d), the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine (\u201cPFLP\u201d) and the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ruling \nfaction, Fatah, all launched attacks on Israeli civilian \ncenters, military installations, vehicles, and civilians \nthrough suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, and rocket \nlaunchings, which resulted in the death and injury of \nhundreds of individuals, including numerous American \ncitizens.\n10. From September 2000 forward, support by the \nPalestinian public for HAMAS grew steadily.\n11. It won elections at Palestinian universities, trade \nunions, and later in municipal elections.\n\nAppendix A\n7a\n12. For approximately the next four years after \nthe outbreak of the violent conflict, HAMAS launched \nhundreds of terrorist attacks targeting civilians that have \nresulted in the deaths and injury of hundreds of civilians, \nincluding numerous American citizens.\nTHE SHOOTING ATTACK ON ROUTE #60 \u2013 \nJUNE 20, 2003\n13. On June 20, 2003, Ahmad Najjar and Farah \nHamad, two HAMAS terrorists, perpetrated a shooting \nattack on Route #60 near the Yabroud underpass, killing \none person and seriously injuring three others.\nThe Goldstein Family\n14. Howard Goldstein was a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Israel when he died.\n15. He was murdered on June 20, 2003, while driving \nhis car with his parents on Route #60 in Israel.\n16. Howard was driving his parents and his wife from \nEli to Jerusalem where they had stayed the previous night \nfollowing the wedding of Howard\u2019s son, plaintiff David \nGoldstein. Howard and his wife and parents were traveling \nfor a weekend in Jerusalem to further celebrate David\u2019s \nwedding (which had taken place the previous night).\n17. While Howard was driving, Howard\u2019s father, \nplaintiff Eugene Goldstein, was seated in the front \npassenger seat and Howard\u2019s mother, plaintiff Lorraine \n\nAppendix A\n8a\nGoldstein, was seated behind her husband. Howard\u2019s wife, \nplaintiff Michal Goldstein (now Michal Honickman), was \nseated in the rear seat of the car, on the driver\u2019s side, \nbehind Howard.\n18. At some point, as Howard was driving, Eugene \nnoticed two individuals on the side of the road near the \nYabroud underpass. As the Goldsteins\u2019 car approached, \nthe men turned and began rapidly firing their guns at the \nGoldsteins\u2019 vehicle.\n19. Howard was struck by at least one bullet and \nultimately succumbed to his injuries while driving and \nslumped over the steering wheel.\n20. At some point in time, while Howard was slumped \nover the steering wheel, Eugene grabbed the steering \nwheel and maintained control of the car until it crashed \nand rolled over, approximately eight miles south of where \nthe HAMAS gunmen had opened fire.\n21. Plaintiff Michal Honickman, formerly known as \nMindy Goldstein, is a citizen of the United States and \na resident of the State of Nevada. She is the widow of \nHoward Goldstein.\n22. Plaintiff Michal Honickman brings this action both \nindividually and as the legal representative of the Estate \nof Howard Goldstein.\n23. As a result of the attack, Michal was injured when \nglass fragments from the vehicle\u2019s windows struck her \n\nAppendix A\n9a\nbody, including her left eye. She also sustained hairline \nfractures of her ribs, bruising, and physical trauma when \nthe vehicle eventually crashed and rolled over.\n24. Michal has sustained severe physical injuries \nand experienced severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress having been present during the attack, \nand witnessed the death of her husband, whom she had to \nbury and mourn with her children, while her in-laws were \nhospitalized, all in the context of what had been, prior to \nthat point, a joyous family occasion celebrating her son \nDavid\u2019s wedding.\n25. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff Michal \nHonickman experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss \nof her husband\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\n26. Plaintiff Eugene Goldstein is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Florida. He is the \nfather of Howard Goldstein.\n27. Plaintiff Lorraine Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of Florida. She \nis the mother of Howard Goldstein.\n28. Eugene suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the \nattack.\n29. His shoulder blade was fractured, and his lungs \nwere punctured. Shrapnel was lodged in his lung, liver \n\nAppendix A\n10a\nand kidneys. A bullet remains stuck between his heart \nand his lungs.\n30. These injuries, which caused Eugene immense \npain, were life threatening. Indeed, it was highly \nimprobable that Eugene would survive them.\n31. Eugene\u2019s injuries necessitated insertion of a trocar, \na metal cylinder used to drain blood from his chest and \nfacilitate insertion of a chest tube to maintain suction and \npermit healing of the lung. Insertions of a trocar and chest \ntube are extremely painful.\n32. Eugene was unable to see Lorraine for \napproximately five days after the attack and did not have \nspecific information about her condition. His uncertainty \nabout Lorraine\u2019s condition caused him immense anxiety.\n33. As a result of the attack, Eugene still has several \nbullet fragments lodged in his chest. He must undergo \nan x-ray every three months to monitor their condition.\n34. As a result of the attack, Eugene has difficulty \nfalling and remaining asleep. He constantly replays the \nimage of the attack in his mind.\n35. He blames himself for taking his wife to attend \nhis grandson\u2019s wedding.\n36. Lorraine was shot multiple times and severely \ninjured in the attack.\n\nAppendix A\n11a\n37. She suffered a bullet fragment injury from a bullet \nthat clipped the tip of her nose and her left upper lip and \nlodged in her mouth. The fragment necessitated intubation \nand emergency surgery, during which the fragment was \nremoved from an area less than an inch from the carotid \nsheath, which contains the carotid artery and the internal \njugular vein. Disruption of either of them would have \nresulted in her death.\n38. At one point during her hospital stay, Lorraine \nwas placed on life support.\n39. Lorraine\u2019s chewing muscles were severely and \npermanently damaged, and she could not eat solid food \nfor approximately one year.\n40. She required physiotherapy that encompassed use \nof a ratchet-like device designed to force her jaws open. \nIt was very painful.\n41. Lorraine still requires physical therapy because \nthe scar tissue in her jaw prevents her from fully opening \nit. She still suffers from pain and headaches.\n42. She requires bridges (partials) because she lost her \nteeth as a result of the attack, and extensive periodontal \nand dental work.\n43. She was also struck by bullets that entered her \nbody through her left shoulder and right lower neck. The \nresulting wounds caused her excruciating pain at the time.\n\nAppendix A\n12a\n44. She must also deal with the harmful effects of \nshrapnel that lodged throughout her body, especially in \nher back. She also suffered a shattered nose and septum \nas well as various lacerations.\n45. Lorraine had difficulty sleeping because she \nthought about Howard\u2019s death.\n46. Eugene and Lorraine remained in Jerusalem at \nHadassah Hospital for approximately 10 days and were \nunable to return home when they were discharged from \nthe hospital because the airline did not give Eugene \npermission to fly due to the poor condition of his lungs.\n47. As a result of the attack, plaintiffs Eugene \nGoldstein and Lorraine Goldstein have sustained severe \nphysical injuries and experienced severe mental anguish \nand extreme emotional distress.\n48. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiffs Eugene \nGoldstein and Lorraine Goldstein have experienced \nemotional pain and suffering, loss of their son\u2019s society, \ncompanionship, comfort, advice and counsel, and severe \nmental anguish and extreme emotional distress.\n49. The Goldstein family in New York received notice \nof the attack from two cousins, one of whom saw images \nof the attack on the internet and sent an instant message \nto the immediate family.\n50. The Goldstein family sat in horror as they watched \nimages of the attack on the Cable News Network (CNN) \n\nAppendix A\n13a\nshortly after the attack occurred. The video broadcast \nshowed Howard, Eugene and Lorraine being pulled from \nthe wreckage of the car Howard had been driving.\n51. Lorraine\u2019s face and hair were covered with blood.\n52. Plaintiff Richard Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of New York. \nHe is a son of plaintiffs Eugene Goldstein and Lorraine \nGoldstein and a brother of Howard Goldstein.\n53. After learning of the attack, plaintiff Richard \nGoldstein telephoned his sister, plaintiff Barbara \nGoldstein Ingardia, at work and asked her to return home \nimmediately. When she arrived, her extended family was \npresent. They shared the tragic news that their parents \nand brother had been attacked. Barbara then made plans \nto fly to Israel to care for her parents.\n54. As a result of the attack, plaintiff Richard \nGoldstein has experienced severe mental anguish and \nextreme emotional distress caused by the life-threatening \ninjuries to both of his parents.\n55. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, Richard Goldstein \nhas experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss of his \nbrother\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice and \ncounsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme emotional \ndistress.\n56. Plaintiff Barbara Goldstein Ingardia is a citizen of \nthe United States and a resident of the State of New York. \n\nAppendix A\n14a\nShe is the daughter of plaintiffs Eugene Goldstein and \nLorraine Goldstein and the sister of Howard Goldstein.\n57. Barbara left her job and her immediate family \nbehind and traveled to Israel to care for her parents in \nIsrael during their recovery and to mourn the loss of her \nbrother.\n58. In addition to grappling with the devastating \nemotional consequences of her brother\u2019s death, she \nwas forced to deal with the uncertainty of her mother\u2019s \nrecovery due to her severe injuries and age.\n59. Barbara blames herself for encouraging her \nparents to attend the wedding.\n60. As a result of the attack, plaintiff Barbara \nGoldstein Ingardia has experienced severe mental \nanguish and extreme emotional distress caused by the \nlife-threatening injuries to both of her parents.\n61. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, Barbara Goldstein \nIngardia has experienced emotional pain and suffering, \nloss of her brother\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, \nadvice and counsel, and severe mental anguish and \nextreme emotional distress.\n62. Plaintiff Michael Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of Florida. He is a \nson of plaintiffs Eugene Goldstein and Lorraine Goldstein \nand a brother of Howard Goldstein.\n\nAppendix A\n15a\n63. As a result of the attack, plaintiff Michael \nGoldstein has experienced severe mental anguish and \nextreme emotional distress caused by the life-threatening \ninjuries to both of his parents.\n64. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, Michael Goldstein \nhas experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss of his \nbrother\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice and \ncounsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme emotional \ndistress.\n65. Plaintiff Chana Freedman is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of New York. She is \nthe daughter of Howard Goldstein and plaintiff Michal \nGoldstein.\n66. Chana and her husband were eating lunch at a \nmall in Jerusalem when they learned that her father and \ngrandparents had been involved in what they believed to \nbe an automobile accident.\n67. Chana\u2019s husband received a telephone call from \nhis father informing the couple to go directly to Hadassah \nHospital.\n68. When Chana and her husband arrived at Hadassah \nHospital, a social worker informed them that Chana\u2019s \nfather had died in the terrorist attack.\n69. Chana informed her brother, David and his wife, \nwho had just been married, of the attack when they \narrived at the hospital.\n\nAppendix A\n16a\n70. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff Chana \nFreedman has experienced emotional pain and suffering, \nloss of her father\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\n71. Plaintiff David Goldstein is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Israel. He is the son \nof Howard Goldstein and plaintiff Michal Goldstein.\n72. At the time of the attack, David was at a Jerusalem \nhotel awaiting his family\u2019s arrival for weekend wedding \ncelebrations when he was notified that something had \nhappened to his parents and his grandparents, and that \nthey had been taken to Hadassah Hospital.\n73. Upon his arrival at the hospital, David learned \nthat his father had been killed in the attack, and that his \nmother and grandparents had been injured.\n74. Prior to the attack, David frequently spoke to his \nfather, including on the morning of his father\u2019s death.\n75. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff David \nGoldstein has experienced emotional pain and suffering, \nloss of his father\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\n\nAppendix A\n17a\nTHE JERUSALEM EGGED BUS #2 BOMBING \u2013 \nAUGUST 19, 2003\n76. On August 19, 2003, Ra\u2019ed Abdul Hamid Misk, a \nHAMAS suicide bomber, detonated explosives on Egged \nBus #2.\n77. Twenty-three people were killed and over 130 \nothers were injured in the attack.\nThe Strauss Family\n78. Plaintiff Moses Strauss is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of New Jersey.\n79. Moses was studying in Israel in 2003 and was \nplanning to return to the United States in April 2004.\n80. At around 9:00 pm on August 19, 2003, he boarded \nEgged Bus #2 in Jerusalem after praying at the Kotel \n(also known as the \u201cWestern Wall\u201d or \u201cWailing Wall\u201d).\n81. Approximately 15 minutes into the bus ride, \nMoses heard a deafening boom when Misk detonated the \nexplosives on the bus.\n82. Moses fell forward as a result of the explosion. His \neyeglasses, jacket, hat and cell phone flew off his body.\n83. As Moses regained his bearings and realized what \nhad occurred, he witnessed people screaming and crying, \nand he saw blood and body parts all around him.\n\nAppendix A\n18a\n84. His clothes were covered with blood, and his \nhearing was severely impaired.\n85. To exit the bus, Moses stepped over bodies, and \nin a state of shock made his way toward his apartment. \nAs he reached the corner near his apartment, he saw a \nfriend, and they went into his friend\u2019s apartment and \ntelephoned Moses\u2019s father, plaintiff Philip Strauss, to tell \nhim Moses had been in an attack, but was alive.

As those precedents make clear, \nobtaining relief from a final judgment under Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 \n(2005).  And those circumstances must demonstrate \n\u201cthat the [moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, \n393 (1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday, and free, calculated, deliberate \nchoices are not to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. \nUnited States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).   \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese finality principles.  And they have uniformly \nrejected attempts by plaintiffs to avoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nstringent requirements by appealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberal amendment policy.  The two inquiries are \nentirely separate.  Accordingly, \u201cif a plaintiff seeks to \nreopen a case under Rule 60(b) in order to file an \namended complaint, she must satisfy one of the Rule \n60(b) grounds before a court may consider her motion \nto amend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it, \nadopting a contrary rule would have placed it \u201calone \nin the Nation in collapsing the Rule 60(b) standard \nwith the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. at 177. \nBut the Second Circuit has done just that\u2014in a \ncase where Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \n\n2 \n \non the complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss and appeal.  The District Court \ndismissed that complaint with prejudice.  The Second \nCircuit affirmed after full merits briefing, oral \nargument, and supplemental briefing.  And at no time \nduring those appellate proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, 18 months after the dismissal with \nprejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed on \nappeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nvacate the judgment so they could try again with an \namended complaint.  The District Court properly \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard to deny Respondents\u2019 motion.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit reversed.  Based on a newly crafted test \nadopted by a split panel in Mandala v. NTT Data, 88 \nF.4th 353 (2d Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied (2d Cir. \nFeb. 13, 2024), the Second Circuit held that the \nDistrict Court abused its discretion in failing to \u201cgive \n\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  In the Second Circuit\u2019s view, district courts are \n\u201crequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem\u201d when plaintiffs seek to reopen a \njudgment in order to file an amended complaint.  Id.   \nThat reasoning is untenable.  The Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test effectively rewrites the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, eviscerates the finality principles \nembodied in Rule 60(b), and contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents several times over.  It also squarely \nconflicts with every one of the eleven other Circuits \nthat have addressed this issue.  Those courts have \n\n3 \n \nunanimously held that Rule 15\u2019s general policy has no \nplace in the Rule 60(b)(6) analysis.  Indeed, over 40 \nyears ago, then-Judge Breyer explained that, absent \nextraordinary circumstances, the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure do not \u201callow plaintiffs to pursue a \ncase to judgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the \ncase by amending their complaint to take account of \nthe court\u2019s decision.\u201d  James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 \n(1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.). \nNot only is the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier test wrong, \nbut its decision threatens to unleash far-reaching \nconsequences in cases filed within that court\u2019s bounds.  \nAs Judge Sullivan noted in his Mandala dissent, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s novel balancing test \u201cwill erode the \nfinality of judgments throughout th[e] Circuit, \nsignificantly undermine the important purposes \nserved by Rule 60(b), and increase the workload of \nbusy district court judges who carry the heaviest \nburden in our system of civil justice.\u201d  Pet.App.192 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Worse still, the test will \nencourage litigants to wait to amend their complaint \nuntil after final judgment and appeals have run their \ncourse, as Respondents did here.  That wasteful course \nis at odds with the finality and efficiency principles \nthat animate the Federal Rules, which this Court\u2019s \nprecedents have long enforced. \nThe Court should thus grant certiorari to restore \nuniformity in the law, to reverse the Second Circuit\u2019s \nerror on this issue of exceptional importance, and to \npreserve the finality of judgments protected by Rule \n60(b)(6). \n\n4 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case is \nreported at 432 F.

Respondents do not seriously \ndispute that the Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule \n60(b)\u2019s stringent standard places it on the short end of \na lopsided circuit split.  In fact, Respondents entirely \nignore the conflicting decisions of several Courts of \nAppeals.  And they get no further with their efforts to \ndistinguish a few bricks in the wall of precedents from \nevery other Circuit that has rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier approach.  Those decisions make clear \nthat the Second Circuit is now \u201calone in the Nation in \ncollapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard \nfor Rule 15(a).\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, \n177 (4th Cir. 2024). \nRespondents similarly do not dispute that, \u201c[t]o \njustify relief under [Rule 60(b)(6)], a party must show \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 suggesting that the \nparty is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  Nor do \nthey dispute that, in this case, their repeated decisions \nnot to amend were \u201cfree, calculated, [and] deliberate.\u201d  \nAckermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).  \nThat should foreclose the extraordinary relief \nRespondents seek here.  \nInstead, Respondents\u2019 primary response is to fault \nthe Petition for not discussing Foman v. Davis, 371 \nU.S. 178 (1962).  But there is a very good reason for \nthat:  Foman involved a Rule 59(e) motion, while this \ncase concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  Indeed, \n\n2 \nthis Court recently emphasized that very point in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), when it refused \nto conflate the two Rules in the habeas context.  Thus, \nFoman\u2019s discussion of Rule 59(e) does not affect the \nRule 60(b)(6) analysis here.   \nInstead, the relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s decisions squarely conflict with Gonzalez by \neschewing Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent rule in favor of a \n\u201cliberal repleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  No other \nCircuit has adopted that misguided approach.   \nUnable to wash away the circuit split or the Second \nCircuit\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedent, \nRespondents try to ward off review by labeling this \ncase \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d  But that is patently incorrect.  \nThis appeal arises from Respondents\u2019 attempt to \nvacate a final judgment that was entered nearly five \nyears ago.  And the ruling denying that motion was \nitself a final order.  Relief from this Court would thus \nfinally end this case, while denying review would \nthwart the efficiency and finality principles that \nanimate the Federal Rules. \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s unprecedented \ndilution of Rule 60(b)(6) conflicts with this Court\u2019s \ndecisions and those of every other Circuit.  It threatens \nto undermine the finality of judgments.  It encourages \nwasteful litigation tactics.  And, as a matter of law, the \ndecision below is simply wrong.  This Court should \ngrant review and reverse.   \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Approach Conflicts \nWith That Of Eleven Other Circuits.  \nRespondents concede the existence of a circuit split \nby failing to address the conflicting decisions \nPetitioner identified from the First, Third, Eighth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Although Respondents \ncherry-pick quotes from some of the others, a review \nof those decisions confirms an irreconcilable split \nbetween the Second Circuit\u2019s newly developed test for \nRule 60(b) motions and the correct test used in the rest \nof the Courts of Appeals. \nA. Respondents Concede that a Circuit Split \nExists.   \nRespondents \ncompletely \nignore \nthen-Judge \nBreyer\u2019s decision for the First Circuit in James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71 (1983).  There, as here, the First \nCircuit confronted a district court\u2019s denial of a post-\njudgment motion to amend a dismissed complaint.  Id. \nat 77.  In affirming, then-Judge Breyer explained that \n\u201cto require the district court to permit amendment \nhere would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to \njudgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the case by \namending their complaint to take account of the \ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 78.  The First Circuit rebuked \nthat approach because it \u201cwould dramatically \nundermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of \njudicial decisions.\u201d  Id.  That reasoning flatly \ncontradicts the \u201cliberal amendment policy\u201d endorsed \nby the Second Circuit.  Pet.App.7.  But Respondents \ndo not even acknowledge the case. \n\n4 \nRespondents also ignore the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d \nCir. 2019).  In Garrett, the Third Circuit explained \nthat, when a party seeks \u201cto reopen a final judgment, \nthe policy favoring the finality of judgments\u201d is \nimplicated, and \u201c[t]he permissive policy favoring \namendment under Rule 15 [is] simply not relevant.\u201d  \nId. at 86.  Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the post-judgment context, \nthe narrow grounds for relief set forth\u201d in Rule 60(b) \n\u201cmust guide a District Court\u2019s decision about whether \nan otherwise-final judgment should  be disturbed.\u201d  Id.\nThe Third Circuit therefore recognizes\u2014unlike the \nSecond Circuit\u2014that \u201ca different set of rules \nemphasizing vastly different policies\u201d pertain to a \nmotion seeking to vacate a final judgment for the \npurposes of amending a complaint.  Id.\nRespondents likewise ignore the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in MacPhee v. MiMedx Grp., Inc., 73 F.4th \n1220 (11th Cir. 2023).  As in this case, the district \ncourt there denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for post-\njudgment vacatur-for-amendment, \u201cexplaining that \nbecause [the plaintiff] waited until after judgment was \nentered to seek such relief, Rule 15(a) did not apply.\u201d  \nId. at 1238.  Unless the plaintiff could first show \n\u201centitle[ment] to relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d it \n\u201cwas not entitled to leave to amend post-judgment.\u201d  \nId.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, embracing this \nrestrictive approach even \u201cwhere the plaintiff has not \nexercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as a \nmatter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250.  Again, that is directly \nat odds with the Second Circuit\u2019s belief that plaintiffs \nneed not \u201cnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before \nthey [can] invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading \n\n5 \npolicy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And, again, Respondents \nconspicuously fail to address it.  \nThe same goes for UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 \nF.4th 1047 (8th Cir. 2024).  As the Eighth Circuit held \nthere, \u201cthe liberal amendment standard in Rule \n15(a)(2) does not govern\u201d for post-judgment motions \nseeking to amend a complaint.  Id. at 1057. Instead, \n\u201ca more restrictive standard reflecting interests of \nfinality applies.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  That is, \n\u201c[l]eave to amend will be granted if\u201d\u2014and only if\u2014\u201cit \nis consistent with the stringent standards governing \nthe grant of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  Id.\n(cleaned up).  Respondents once again ignore this \ndecision, which squarely conflicts with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement that district courts \u201cbalance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Mandala v. \nNTT Data, 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023).   \nRespondents similarly ignore the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for \nunsuccessful litigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. \nGates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To be sure, \nRespondents obliquely note that the D.C. Circuit has \nallowed \npost-judgment \namendment \nin \n\u201ccertain \ncircumstances.\u201d  BIO.27.  But those are where the \nmovant has \u201cprevailed on the claim in question.\u201d  Bldg. \nIndus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nRespondents\u2019 claims were dismissed with prejudice, \nand that dismissal was affirmed on appeal.  \n\n6 \nIn short, by their own omissions, Respondents \nconcede the decision below conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. \nCircuits.  That alone should warrant review. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Discussion of Other Circuit \nDecisions \nConfirms \nthat \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit Has Adopted an Outlier Approach. \nThe circuit split extends far beyond the cases \nRespondents ignore.   \nMost notably, in Daulatzai, the Fourth Circuit \nspecifically rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in a \nthoroughly reasoned opinion.   See 97 F.4th at 180.  \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial \nof a Rule 60(b) motion.  In so doing, the Fourth Circuit \nconfronted the exact error that the Second Circuit \ncommitted in Mandala and this case.  It expressly \n\u201creject[ed] \nDaulatzai\u2019s \nargument\u201d \nthat \nearlier \nprecedents \u201ccollapsing . . . the standards under Rule \n59(e) and Rule 15(a) should also apply when the \nmotion seeks relief from the judgment under Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphases added).  Thus, unlike the \nSecond Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has correctly held \nthat, \u201cwhen the motion to vacate is filed under Rule \n60(b), the more restrictive standard for granting that \nmotion must be satisfied before consideration can be \ngiven to the motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphasis \nadded).  By contrast, the Second Circuit here faulted \nthe District Court for \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \nvacate and amend as calling for two distinct analyses\u201d \nunder Rule 60(b) and then Rule 15(a).  Pet.App.7-8; see \n\n7 \nalso Mandala 88 F.4th at 361.  The two approaches \nare impossible to square.1\nRespondents only further underscore this error by \ntrying to leverage a pair of Second Circuit decisions \naddressing Rule 59(e) to suggest its approach is \nconsistent with the law of other Circuits.  See BIO.21-\n23 (discussing Metzler Investment Gmbh v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2020) and \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam)).  But whether those earlier cases are \nconsistent with other Circuits\u2019 Rule 59(e) cases does \nnot alter the fact that the Second Circuit\u2019s treatment \nof Rule 60(b) motions seeking to replead sharply \nconflicts with the decisions of every other Circuit \napplying Rule 60(b).  On that latter issue, which is the \nquestion presented here, the Second Circuit has \nabandoned the extraordinary-circumstances standard \nto require district courts \u201cto consider Rule 60(b) \nfinality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  \nPet.App.7.  In other words, it has forbade district \ncourts from analyzing Rule 60(b) motions \u201cunder only \nRule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat clashes with the otherwise unanimous view of \nthe Courts of Appeals, which have consistently held \nthat plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \n1 Rather than confront the Fourth Circuit\u2019s thoughtful analysis \nin Daulatzai, Respondents suggest the Fourth Circuit must have \nbeen aware of the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in Mandala and \nHonickman.  BIO.23.  But the Second Circuit issued its mistaken \nopinions after Daulatzai was argued on October 24, 2023.  And \nthe docket in Daulatzai reflects that neither party filed a Rule \n28(j) letter bringing either Mandala or this case to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s attention.  It is thus no surprise that the Fourth Circuit \ndid not mention the Second Circuit\u2019s erroneous decisions. \n\n8 \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before\u201d \ninvoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  In re \nFerro Corp. Deriv. Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Ewing v. 1645 \nW. Farragut LLC, 90 F.4th 876, 893 (7th Cir. 2024); \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017); Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 \nF.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. 2003); Cooper v. Shumway, 780 \nF.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThis Court should thus grant certiorari to remedy \nthe split and confirm that losing litigants may not \ndeploy the policies of Rule 15(a) to bypass Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nexacting requirements for relief. \nII. Respondents\u2019 Reliance On Foman Only \nReinforces The Fundament Flaws In The \nSecond Circuit\u2019s Approach.  \nNot only are Respondents\u2019 efforts to obscure the \ncircuit split unavailing, but their attempt to defend \nthe \ndecision \nbelow \nonly \nfurther \nreveals \nthe \nfundamental legal error in the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier \napproach.  Respondents rely principally on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Foman, and they emphasize that \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s precedents have done the same.  \nBut Foman is categorically inapt, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s reliance on it was the very legal error that \ncaused it to split with every other Circuit and violate \nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents.   \nCritically, the Foman decision did not address a \nRule 60(b)(6) motion.  This court instead recognized \nthe motion \u201cas one under Rule 59(e).\u201d  371 U.S. at 181.  \nAs a result, Foman is simply irrelevant to this case.  \n\n9 \nRather, the controlling precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a Rule \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at 536.  Respondents and \nthe Second Circuit thus have the analysis backwards. \nIndeed, \nin \nBanister \nv. \nDavis, \nthis \nCourt \nemphasized the critical distinctions between Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b).  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-\ntime effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued \ndecision to a [district] court\u2019s attention, before taking \na single appeal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 521.  Accordingly, the \ntime for bringing a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis short\u201428 \ndays from entry of the judgment, with no possibility of \nan extension.\u201d  Id.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding,\u201d a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201c\u2018suspend[s] the finality\u2019 of any judgment.\u201d  Id. \nat 514 (cleaned up).  By contrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) \nmotion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always \ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already \ncompleted judgment.\u201d  Id. at 520-21.  Rather than \n\u201caid[ing] the trial court to get its decision right in the \nfirst instance,\u201d a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cserve[s] to \ncollaterally attack [an] already completed judgment.\u201d  \nId. at 518-19. It therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id.\nAnd for that reason, the \u201cstandard for granting a Rule \n59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d than \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  Daulatzai, 97 \nF.4th at 177.  In short, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule \n59(e) in just about every way that matters to the \ninquiry here.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 518; see \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177-78.   \n\n10 \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach fails to grasp these \ncrucial differences.  Instead, it wrongly treats Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions as fungible, and then \nrelies on Foman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard \nto override the strict requirements of Rule 60(b)(6) set \nforth in Gonzalez.  Thus, Respondents\u2019 effort to chide \nBLOM for not citing Foman only confirms that their \napproach\u2014which the Second Circuit adopted\u2014\nobliterates the critical distinction between Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b)(6).  No other Circuit has adopted that \ncategory error.  To the contrary, they have all rejected \nit.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in \nDaulatzai thoroughly debunks it.   \nMoreover, even if Foman somehow applied, the \nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion clearly \nsatisfied its requirements.  In Foman, this Court held \nonly that \u201coutright refusal to grant [plaintiffs] leave \n[to amend] without any justifying reason\u201d is an abuse \nof discretion.  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, the District Court \nprovided multiple reasons for its denial.  For starters, \nRespondents \u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all \nlegal avenues available to them for relief,\u201d yet they \nengaged in a \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe \ndeficiencies \nidentified \nin \ntheir \npleading.\u201d  \nPet.App.16; Pet.App.19.  In addition, the District \nCourt dismissed their complaint with prejudice, and \nthat decision was affirmed based on one of the grounds \nidentified by the District Court.  Pet.App.13; \nPet.App.15 n.3.  During the appeal, Respondents \nnever challenged the District Court\u2019s decision to \ndismiss with prejudice, and they never requested leave \nto \namend\u2014even \nduring \nsupplemental \nbriefing \nfollowing the Second Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in \nKaplan.  Pet.10-11.  And, even to the extent the \n\n11 \nSecond Circuit \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201d the law in its decision, the \nDistrict Court explained that \u201ca mere change in \ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nPet.App.14 (citation omitted); accord Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997) (\u201cIntervening \ndevelopments in the law by themselves rarely \nconstitute the extraordinary circumstances required \nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(6)[.]\u201d). \nIII. This \nCase \nDoes \nNot \nArise \nIn \nAn \nInterlocutory Posture. \nFaced with an undeniable circuit split and patently \nincorrect decision, Respondents attempt to label the \ndecision below \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to suggest that this case \npresents a \u201cpoor vehicle\u201d for review.  BIO.1; BIO.18-\n19; BIO.28.  But that is wrong as well.  Far from being \ninterlocutory, there is undeniably a final judgment in \nthis action.  See Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), aff\u2019d, 6 F.4th 487 (2d \nCir. 2021).  Indeed, this appeal exists only because \nRespondents have sought to vacate that final \njudgment.  Respondents also ignore that an order \ndenying a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cappealed as \u2018a \nseparate final order.\u2019\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 520 \n(quoting Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 401 (1995)).  And \nthey do not dispute that reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision would finally end this case for good.  There is \nthus nothing interlocutory about this appeal. \nWhat Respondents seem to really mean is that \nBLOM may still win yet again on remand.  On that \nbasis, Respondents suggest that review now may be \nunnecessary and inefficient.  BIO.18.  But that \nassertion is indicative of Respondents\u2019 abusive \n\n12 \nattitude toward the Federal Rules.  After Respondents \ndeclined multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint, BLOM secured dismissal with prejudice.  \nRather than move at that time to amend under Rule \n59(e), Respondents chose to appeal.  Even during \nsupplemental briefing on appeal, Respondents never \nasked the Second Circuit to remand so they could \nreplead.  And when the Second Circuit affirmed, \nRespondents did not seek rehearing.  Instead, they \nfiled a Rule 60(b)(6) motion that sought to start the \nprocess all over again\u2014on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts (of which they were \npreviously aware) in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  Applying this Court\u2019s standards under Rule \n60(b)(6), the District Court properly denied the \nmotion.  Had the Second Circuit similarly applied Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014or had this case arisen in any other \nCircuit\u2014this loop of relitigation would already be \nover.   \nRather than allow this inefficient distortion of the \nFederal Rules to continue, this Court should grant \nreview and restore uniformity in the law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in \nBLOM\u2019s Petition, certiorari should be granted. \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

The summary order \ndoes not even take a position on what the outcome of \nthe underlying motion to vacate should be\u2014it only di-\nrects the district court \u201cto reconsider Plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion\u201d in light of pre-existing Supreme Court and Sec-\nond Circuit precedents. Pet. App. 8. \nBLOM ignores each of these precedents but one\u2014a \ncase, unrelated to this one, called Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d Cir. 2023). BLOM is in fact \nseeking this Court\u2019s review of Mandala, which it erro-\nneously suggests permits plaintiffs to seek post-judg-\nment amendment under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal stand-\nards, purportedly \u201ceviscerat[ing] the finality princi-\nples embodied in Rule 60(b)\u201d and all but guaranteeing \ngamesmanship. Pet. 2. In reality, Mandala reaffirmed \nthat \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d 88 F.4th \nat 361. Mandala and this case are \u201camong the few that \njustifies relief from final judgment under 60(b)(6).\u201d Id. \nat 356.  \n This Court should decline Petitioner\u2019s request for \ninterlocutory review of the summary order below. \nEven if Mandala\u2019s recitation of the vacatur standards \nwas worth review (it is not), Honickman is a poor ve-\nhicle to do so\u2014the facts here are more extreme than \nthose in Mandala, and the grounds for vacatur there-\nfore much stronger.  \nHere, the district court applied the wrong stand-\nards in dismissing Respondents\u2019 (or \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nclaims under the Justice Against Sponsors of Terror-\nism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d). These erroneous standards were \nalso essentially impossible for Plaintiffs to meet on \namendment. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal, and the \nSecond Circuit \u201cagree[d] that the [district] court did \nnot apply the proper standard.\u201d Pet. App. 25. The cir-\ncuit set forth a clarified standard for pleading JASTA \nclaims, and only affirmed dismissal \u201con other \ngrounds,\u201d Pet. App. 10\u2014in fact, the circuit identified a \nsingle pleading deficiency that could be remedied on \namendment. Conversely, in Mandala the circuit \nagreed with the district court\u2019s reasoning, but thought \nthe deficiency the district court identified could be cor-\nrected with the right amendment. \nAs the circuit explained in the summary order be-\nlow, once \u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, \nPlaintiffs returned to the district court and moved un-\nder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) and \n15(a)(2) to vacate the judgment of dismissal and grant \nthem leave to file a first amended complaint.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 5. But the district court denied the motion, argu-\ning that Plaintiffs waived the chance to amend when \nthey declined its two prior invitations to amend \u201cin re-\nsponse to the arguments raised by Defendant,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16-17\u2014even though Plaintiffs correctly viewed \nthese \u201carguments\u201d as wrong (and unmeetable on \namendment). In the subsequent appeal, the circuit va-\ncated that denial and remanded for the district court \nto consider the motion again in light of prior prece-\ndents, including this Court\u2019s decision in Foman v. Da-\nvis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962), and Second Circuit precedent, \nincluding Mandala.  \nBLOM incorrectly argues that Mandala (and thus \nHonickman) conflicts with the cases BLOM has raised \nin its petition. They do not\u2014the precedents cited in \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nHonickman (and Mandala) balance Rule 60\u2019s finality \nwith this Court\u2019s rule that it is an \u201cabuse of \u2026 discre-\ntion\u201d to deny a post-judgment motion to amend \u201cwith-\nout any justifying reason,\u201d such as \u201cundue delay, bad \nfaith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments pre-\nviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party \nby virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility \nof amendment.\u201d Foman, 371 U.S. at 182. Notably, \nBLOM does not cite this \u201cseminal\u201d case once in its pe-\ntition. \nMoreover, none of the cases BLOM cites involve the \n\u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances at issue here, much less \nin Mandala. And despite BLOM\u2019s assurance that \ngamesmanship will surely follow, this case is clearly \nlimited to the scenario where a district court has de-\nnied a plaintiff a meaningful opportunity to amend, a \nclear inequity. This Court should deny certiorari. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019. \nThat complaint alleged that BLOM aided and abetted \na series of terrorist attacks committed by the Palestin-\nian terrorist group Hamas, injuring Plaintiffs. Specif-\nically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly pro-\nvided substantial assistance to three Hamas fronts \n(the \u201cThree Customers\u201d)\u2014principally the purported \ncharitable institution Sanabil, which the United \nStates designated a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Ter-\nrorist\u201d in 2003. BLOM assisted Sanabil in converting \ndonations from Hamas supporters abroad into cash, \nwhich Sanabil handed out to recruit Palestinians liv-\ning in Lebanon to join Hamas.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. A-188-91.1 \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the interpre-\ntive framework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s \nthen-only prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, \nPLC, 882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).   \nPlaintiffs responded on May 8, 2019, providing a \nsummary of their anticipated opposition. A-192-95. In \ntheir response, Plaintiffs argued that the scienter \nstandard from Halberstam governed their claims, not-\ning that foreseeability was the key factor in assessing \na defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct. As shown below, the \ncircuit ultimately vindicated this analysis. \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, A-199, it then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by the Second Circuit from the \nD.C. Circuit. [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel], do you want \nthat opportunity?  \n \n1 Citations to A-____ are to the joint appendix in the court of \nappeals. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nA-200-01. As Defendant\u2019s pre-motion letter makes \nclear, these Second and D.C. Circuit \u201cstandards\u201d re-\nferred to the Linde and Halberstam decisions, respec-\ntively. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think we are \nprepared to brief it based on the arguments presented \nin [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d A-201. This was entirely \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were both substantively correct and \nsignificantly different from those asserted by BLOM \nand later adopted by the district court. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting that: \u201cThe parties discussed Defendant\u2019s pro-\nposed motion to dismiss. The Court offered Plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaint to add addi-\ntional information in response to the arguments raised \nby Defendant. Plaintiffs declined to do so and repre-\nsented that they would not be seeking to amend their \nComplaint in this regard.\u201d A-78 (emphasis added). \nThat is, the district court offered Plaintiffs the oppor-\ntunity to meet BLOM\u2019s urged standards, which they \ndeclined. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters. BLOM again made a series of erroneous argu-\nments as to why Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a \nclaim.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on the district court de-\ncision in Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, \n405 F. Supp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nin relevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan \nII\u201d). Kaplan I dismissed JASTA allegations against \nLebanese Canadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d) for providing finan-\ncial services for the terrorist group Hezbollah. A-286-\n87. As BLOM pointed out, LCB provided those finan-\ncial services for fronts for Hezbollah, much as BLOM \nallegedly did for Hamas. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. In Kaplan I, the \ndistrict court acknowledged that the plaintiffs alleged \na litany of public sources, including statements from \nHezbollah itself, tying five of LCB\u2019s customers to Hez-\nbollah. But, as the Second Circuit later explained in \nreversing the decision, the district court \u201cfound these \nto be insufficient because \u2018Plaintiffs nowhere allege . . . \nthat Defendant read or was aware of such sources.\u2019\u201d \n999 F.3d at 852 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at \n535). Naturally, before discovery, a plaintiff will rarely \nbe able to find support for what sources a defendant \nhas actually read or was aware of. Nonetheless, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nA-306-07. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nResponding to Defendant\u2019s argument that Kaplan \nI correctly applied JASTA to the facts pleaded in that \ncase, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated:  \nKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of \nstep with JASTA, out of step with Linde and \nwould be impossible to meet.  \n. . .  \nRespectfully, a case that requires [allegations \nthat the bank possessed] knowledge of [Hezbol-\nlah\u2019s] purchasing of rockets [specifically] is, a[t] \na minimum, is going to render the ATA a dead \nletter, and certainly make Halberstam irrele-\nvant to the analysis.  \nA-302-03. \nDuring the oral argument, the district court reiter-\nated Plaintiffs\u2019 decision not to amend their complaint \nmade at the pre-motion conference: \u201cThere are no facts \nthat you would have to offer to address some of the \ncontentions of the defendants regarding knowledge, \nespecially?\u201d A-300. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cI \nthink we could always add allegations, but . . . we be-\nlieve the complaint goes far enough in saying that \nBLOM holding accounts for Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists designated for . . . financing HA-\nMAS, was generally aware of its role in that [il]licit \nconduct, and . . . the violence that resulted from it was \nforeseeable, as was the case in Linde.\u201d Id. \nThus, Plaintiffs declined the district court\u2019s two in-\nvitations to replead based on their (largely correct and \nentirely reasonable) understanding at that time of the \npleading standard and elements of aiding and abetting \nunder JASTA. Plaintiffs did not believe they should or \ncould amend their complaint to meet \u201cthe contentions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nof the defendant[] regarding knowledge,\u201d id., which \nwas that Plaintiffs must allege the \u201clevel of \nknowledge\u201d required in Kaplan I. That is, Plaintiffs \ndid not believe they should or could allege that BLOM \nemployees \u201cread or were aware\u201d of specific pieces of in-\nformation before discovery. See A-306-07.  \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss, largely on the grounds BLOM raised and, as \nBLOM urged, by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The dis-\ntrict court called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate com-\nparison\u201d and \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d \nthan other JASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs \nanalogized their complaint. Honickman I, 432 F. Supp. \n3d 253, 266, 269 (E.D.N.Y. 2020).  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s standard for pleading knowledge. The dis-\ntrict court explained that in Kaplan I: \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan. \nId. at 267 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535). \nHaving adopted this position, the district court then \nfaulted Plaintiffs for not alleging \u201cany acts or state-\nments by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees which suggest \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nany awareness on its part of a connection between any \nof the Three Customers and Hamas,\u201d and for relying \non \u201cpress articles, government actions, and allegedly \n\u2018public knowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such a connection. Id. \nat 265.  \nAs explained further in the next section, this error \nis especially important here because, like most victims \nof terrorism who bring suit under JASTA, Plaintiffs \ndid not have access to \u201cacts or statements of BLOM or \nBLOM\u2019s employees\u201d before discovery. Moving to \namend after dismissal\u2014or accepting the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend, such as during oral argu-\nment where BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of \nits knowledge\u2014would have been pointless. And while \nthe Second Circuit also found Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of \nBLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas \naffiliations insufficient, it did so for remediable rea-\nsons\u2014not because it required plausible allegations of \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations.  \nFinally, although Plaintiffs did not request leave to \namend, the district court noted that \u201c[i]n light of Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 rejection of the opportunity to amend their plead-\ning at the pre-motion conference, and the fact that \nthey have not identified any additional facts they \ncould allege which would address the deficiencies in \ntheir complaint, the Court finds that it need not grant \nPlaintiffs leave to amend.\u201d Id. at 270-71.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision as applying the wrong pleading stand-\nards. Petitioner faults Plaintiffs for not moving for va-\ncatur instead of appealing, or not appealing the with-\nprejudice nature of the dismissal. But, again, Plain-\ntiffs did not want leave to amend in order to meet the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous standards, nor did they have \nevidence to support allegations to do so. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nAfter briefing and argument on the appeal was \ncomplete, the Second Circuit issued its decision vacat-\ning Kaplan I as to its dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 JASTA \naiding and abetting claims against LCB. At the cir-\ncuit\u2019s direction, the Honickman parties submitted sup-\nplemental briefs on the effect of Kaplan II. Petitioners \nagain fault Plaintiffs for not asking the circuit court \nfor leave to amend in their supplemental brief, but in \nthe Second Circuit, that is a decision for the district \ncourt to make \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, \n574 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009). The circuit then is-\nsued its decision in Honickman on July 29, 2021. \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Court \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 6 F.4th 487, 490 \n(2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). Specifically, the cir-\ncuit rejected every standard the district court applied \nas grounds for dismissal, including the standard for \nalleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Customers\u2019 \naffiliation with Hamas and for alleging the general \nawareness and substantial assistance elements, which \ntogether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-\nabetting cases.\u201d Id. at 496. These are detailed infra. \nPetitioner largely elides these rejections. Moreover, \nPetitioner compares the district court\u2019s pleading \nstandards to this Court\u2019s analysis in Twitter v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023), to suggest those stand-\nards were ultimately vindicated. That is not correct, \nbut it is also irrelevant\u2014Taamneh was not issued \nwhen Plaintiffs sought amendment to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Honickman II. If Taamneh \ndid change the pleading standards in a material way, \nthat is only further reason to provide Plaintiffs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nopportunity to meet them in an amended complaint. \nAfter all, courts have long observed that \u201cRule 60(b) is \nclearly designed to permit a desirable legal objective: \nthat cases may be decided on their merits.\u201d Patapoff v. \nVollstedt\u2019s, Inc., 267 F.2d 863, 865 (9th Cir. 1959). \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe Second Circuit specifically rejected the plead-\ning standard the district court applied to Plaintiffs\u2019 \nknowledge allegations:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nHonickman II, 6 F.4th at 501 (citations omitted). \nIn Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Accordingly, the district court was required \u201cto \naccept as true the . . . factual allegations as to the re-\npeated multimedia statements by Hizbollah, to con-\nsider all of the complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nconsidering each in isolation, and to accept as true all \npermissible inferences that could be drawn from the \ncomplaint as a whole.\u201d Id. at 865.2  \nThis correction is critical because while a  proposed \namended complaint could add numerous allegations \nand cite various publications and websites in English, \nFrench and Arabic\u2014all of which would add to the \u201cper-\nmissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas\u2014those allegations would satisfy the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarified\u201d pleading standard, but not \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d requirement adopted \nby the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for as\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n10: 20241209152632359_No.2023-125920Joint20Appendix20Volume20220of202.json (score: 0.321)\nNo. 23-1259\nIn the\nSupreme Court of the United States\nOn Writ of Certiorari to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nA\n(800) 274-3321 \u2022 (800) 359-6859\nJOINT APPENDIX\nVolume 2 of 2 (Pages 257a to 509a)\n130554\nPETITION FOR CERTIORARI FILED MAY 29, 2024\nCERTIORARI GRANTED OCTOBER 4, 2024\nMichael H.

Lebanese Canadian \nBank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (recaptioned \n2 University Plaza, \n   Suite 402, \nHackensack, NJ 07601\nT. 201.265.6400 \nF. 201.265.0303\n1441 Broadway, Suite 6022, \nNew York, NY 10018\nT.212.354.0111\n\nAppendix J\n260a\nfrom Reuvane), compels vacatur of the district court\u2019s \njudgment because its grounds for dismissing the action \nwere predicated almost exclusively on the same erroneous \nlegal analysis squarely rejected in Kaplan.\nThe Kaplan plaintiffs alleged in relevant part that \nthe defendant, Lebanese Canadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), aided \nand abetted a series of rocket attacks that the Foreign \nTerrorist Organization (\u201cFTO\u201d) Hezbollah launched at \nIsraeli targets, causing the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Specifically, \nthe plaintiffs alleged that LCB \u201cprovid[ed] banking \nservices to certain individuals or entities alleged to be \npart of or closely affiliated with Hizbollah\u201d (the \u201cFive \nCustomers\u201d), Kaplan at 845, and did so \u201cwithout disclosing \ntheir source, thereby circumventing sanctions imposed \nin order to hinder terrorist attacks,\u201d id. at 866. These \nservices substantially assisted Hezbollah by providing it \nwith access to potentially millions of untraceable dollars, \nforeseeably risking terrorist attacks.\nThe Kaplan lower court, 405 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. \n2019), dismissed the complaint on three grounds: (1) the \nplaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that LCB knew the Five \nCustomers were affiliated with Hezbollah; (2) even if LCB \nknowingly provided financial services to Hezbollah, that \nknowledge would not meet JASTA\u2019s \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d \nstandard; and (3) LCB did not knowingly provide \nsubstantial assistance because it did not \u201cknowingly and \nintentionally support\u201d the rocket attacks or knowingly \nprovide money to Hezbollah itself.\nThis Court rejected all three grounds for dismissal. \nFirst, it held that a complaint may \u201ccontain general \n\nAppendix J\n261a\nallegations as to a defendant\u2019s knowledge\u201d (that its \ncustomers were FTO affiliates)\u2014including relying on the \nplausible inference that the defendant would be aware of \npublicly available information. Kaplan at 864. Second, \nit confirmed that JASTA, incorporating Halberstam v. \nWelch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), requires allegations \nthat a defendant \u201cwas generally aware of its role in an \n\u2018overall illegal activity\u2019 from which an \u2018act of international \nterrorism\u2019 was a foreseeable risk,\u201d and that \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d is a less demanding standard than actual \nawareness. Id. at 860, 863-64. Finally, it held that plaintiffs \nneed only show a bank \u201cknowingly provid[ed] assistance\u2014\nwhether directly .\u00a0.\u00a0. or indirectly\u2014and .\u00a0.\u00a0. that assistance \nwas substantial,\u201d id. at 866\u2014not that it \u201cknowingly and \nintentionally supported\u201d terrorist attacks.\nKaplan compels reversal here because the Kaplan and \nHonickman complaints are substantially similar\u2014indeed, \nthe court below rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 citations to other \nJASTA and ATA decisions, finding twice that a \u201cmore \nappropriate comparison is Judge Daniels\u2019s recent decision \nin Kaplan,\u201d SPA-24. See also SPA-31. In both Kaplan \nand Honickman: (1) the plaintiffs are Americans injured \nin terrorist attacks while traveling or living in Israel; \n(2) the attacks were committed by FTOs that operated \nopenly in Lebanon and were notorious for committing \nterrorist attacks on civilians in Israel over many years; \n(3) the defendants are Lebanese banks that allegedly \nprovided banking services to FTOs through organizations \nbelonging to the FTOs\u2019 respective \u201csocial wings\u201d; (4) \nthe banks allowed the FTOs to convert international \nfunds transfers into unusual cash transactions capable \n\nAppendix J\n262a\nof circumventing anti-money laundering and counter-\nterror sanctions; (5) the banks\u2019 customers were publicly \nassociated with the FTOs in Lebanon and headed by \nprominent leaders of the respective FTOs; and (6) those \ncustomers were later designated as Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists (\u201cSDGTs\u201d) by the United States.\nBecause of these similarities, the district court in \nHonickman explicitly adopted the three holdings from \nthe lower Kaplan decision\u2014including its erroneous \napplication of Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d 314 \n(2d Cir. 2018) and Siegel v. HSBC N. Am. Holdings, Inc., \n933 F.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2019)\u2014that this Court specifically \nrejected on appeal. These errors require reversal here. \nI. \t KAPLAN REQUIRES REVERSAL ON GENERAL \nAWARENESS\nAs Plaintiffs argued in their prior briefs, the district \ncourt improperly rejected the Halberstam standard as \nforeclosed by Linde and Siegel: \u201cIn light of [Siegel and \nLinde], it is not enough for Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege \nthat BLOM was generally aware of [its] role in terrorist \nactivities, from which terrorist attacks were a natural \nand foreseeable consequence.\u201d SPA-18 (citations omitted). \nSee also SPA-19 n.8 (erroneously finding that general \nawareness of a role in \u201cHamas\u2019s terrorist enterprise,\u201d \neven if sufficient under Halberstam, would still not satisfy \nLinde). This Court rejected LCB\u2019s (nearly verbatim) \nrendition of this same argument, Kaplan at 860, writing, \n\u201cnothing in Linde repudiates the Halberstam standard \nthat a defendant may be liable for aiding and abetting an \n\nAppendix J\n263a\nact of terrorism if it was generally aware of its role in an \n\u2018overall illegal activity\u2019 from which an \u2018act of international \nterrorism\u2019 was a foreseeable risk.\u201d Id.\nThis Court further found the rocket attacks at issue \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d from the banking services LCB provided \nto its customers, including the Martyrs Foundation \n(\u201cShahid\u201d). Id. at 860-61. This is consistent with the \nSupreme Court\u2019s finding that even the deconflicting \ntraining plaintiffs challenging \u00a7\u00a02339B proposed providing \nto an FTO (\u201cPKK\u201d) could foreseeably lead to violence:\nIt is wholly foreseeable that the PKK could \nuse the \u201cspecific skill[s]\u201d that plaintiffs propose \nto impart, .\u00a0.\u00a0. as part of a broader strategy \nto promote terrorism. The PKK could, for \nexample, pursue peaceful negotiation as \na means of buying time to recover from \nshort-term setbacks, lulling opponents into \ncomplacency, and ultimately preparing for \nrenewed attacks.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . A foreign terrorist \norganization introduced to the structures \nof the international legal system might use \nthe information to threaten, manipulate, and \ndisrupt. This possibility is real, not remote.\nHolder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 36-37 \n(2010) (emphasis added).\nProviding millions of dollars in untraceable cash to an \nFTO creates a much more foreseeable risk of terrorist acts \nthan deconflicting training. The Supreme Court explained: \n\nAppendix J\n264a\n\u201c[m]oney is fungible, and Congress logically concluded \nthat money a terrorist group such as the PKK obtains \nusing the techniques plaintiffs propose to teach could \nbe redirected to funding the group\u2019s violent activities.\u201d \nId. at 37 (emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit likewise \nheld that Hamas attacks in Israel were \u201cforeseeable \nconsequences\u201d of \u201caugmenting Hamas\u2019s resources,\u201d by \nproviding it with money. Boim v. Holy Land Found. \nfor Relief & Dev., 549 F.3d 685, 694 (7th Cir. 2008) (en \nbanc). Thus, \u201cearmark[ing]\u201d funds \u201cfor the organization\u2019s \nnonterrorist activities does not get you off the liability \nhook,\u201d given \u201cthe fungibility of money.\u201d Id. at 698. Funds \nfor BLOM\u2019s \u201cThree Customers\u201d freed up funds which, \nfor example, Hamas\u2019s operatives in Lebanon funneled to \ntheir counterparts in the Palestinian Territories to finance \nterrorist attacks. Compl. \u00b6\u00a0587.1\nFinally, even were money not fungible, \u201cHamas\u2019s social \nwelfare activities reinforce its terrorist activities\u201d by \nsupporting families of terrorists and \u201cenhancing Hamas\u2019s \npopularity among the Palestinian population.\u201d Boim at \n698. As a result, \u201c[a]nyone who knowingly contributes \nto the nonviolent wing of an organization that he knows \nto engage in terrorism is knowingly contributing to the \norganization\u2019s terrorist activities.\u201d Id.\nII. \tKAPLAN REQUIRES REVERSAL ON THE \nPLEADING STANDARD FOR KNOWLEDGE\nPlaintiffs provided detailed allegations supporting \nthe plausible inference that BLOM knew the Hamas \n1.\u2002 All paragraph citations herein are to the Complaint, Joint \nAppendix at 81-166.\n\nAppendix J\n265a\naffiliations of the Three Customers and their transferors. \nPlaintiffs plausibly pleaded that Hamas operated openly \nin Lebanon as a terrorist group since at least 1994 \nand that articles published in major newspapers from \n1994-2001 described Hamas fundraising. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0514, 528-\n30. Sanabil and the Union of Good were run by Hamas \nleaders; Plaintiffs provided their names and positions \nand showed that Sanabil\u2019s directors had prominent roles \nin Lebanon during the relevant period. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0591-94, 639. \nBLOM deposited vast sums into the Sanabil and Subul \nal-Khair accounts from Hamas fundraisers Interpal, \nCBSP, and Al-Aqsa Foundation (\u201cAAF\u201d) after they \nwere designated by Israel (and in AAF\u2019s case, also by \nGermany) and continued servicing these accounts after \ntheir biggest funding source, Holy Land Foundation \n(\u201cHLF\u201d), was designated an SDGT by the United States \nin 2001 (including depositing hundreds of thousands of \ndollars from HLF\u2019s successor organization, KindHearts, \ninto Sanabil\u2019s accounts). \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0539, 542, 550-51, 554, 567, \n588, 590, 596-606, 623-25. Finally, BLOM permitted \nSanabil and Subul al-Khair to withdraw these funds in \nblocks of untraceable cash, \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0611, 626, in an area where \nHamas regularly transferred funds to its operatives in \nthe Palestinian Territories, \u00b6\u00a0587.\nThese allegations comport with this Court\u2019s holding \nin Kaplan that, under JASTA, defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cmust \nbe evaluated in the context of the enterprise they aided,\u201d \nKaplan at 865 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488), \nwhich context includes the relevant FTO\u2019s \u201cpolicy and \npractice of engaging in terrorist raids\u2014and repeatedly \npublicizing that policy and practice,\u201d the duration of its \n\nAppendix J\n266a\n\u201ccampaign of terrorist attacks against civilians,\u201d the \ntiming of the banking services provided, and the amounts \nof money furnished to the FTO as a result. Id. Here, \nBLOM knew it was transferring millions of dollars for \nPalestinian organizations in Lebanon belonging to Hamas \nin the midst of an intensive Hamas terror campaign \nagainst Israeli and American civilians.\nThe court below, however, heavily relied on the lower \nKaplan decision in rejecting these types of knowledge \nallegations; it found publicly available information \ninherently insufficient, quoting Judge Daniels\u2019s finding \nthat although the plaintiffs there alleged \u201cthe entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u2018was [sic] openly, publicly and \nrepeatedly acknowledged and publicized by Hizbollah,\u201d \nthey \u201c\u2018nowhere allege[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. that [LCB] read or was aware \nof such sources.\u2019\u201d SPA-26 (quoting Kaplan, 405 F.\u00a0Supp. \n3d at 535). The district court did the same in suggesting \nthat preexisting, U.S. designations are necessary to allege \nknowledge, citing the Kaplan finding that \u201c[n]one of the \nentities were designated by the United States prior to \nthe rocket attacks at issue as having an affiliation with \nHizbollah.\u201d SPA-25-26 (quoting Kaplan, 405 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d \nat 535).\nThis Court rejected all of these propositions. First, it \nexplained that \u201c[a] complaint is allowed to contain general \nallegations as to a defendant\u2019s knowledge, see Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 9(b), because \u2018a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected \nto plead a defendant\u2019s actual state of mind.\u2019\u201d Id. at 864 \n(quoting Conn. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Fluor Corp., 808 F.2d 957, \n962 (2d Cir. 1987)). See also Pls. Mem. at 29-32 (citing \n\nAppendix J\n267a\ncases). It thus rejected the requirement that plaintiffs \nplead that a bank \u201c\u2018read or was aware of such sources,\u2019\u201d \nexplaining that \u201cthe court was required to accept as true \nthe above factual allegations as to the repeated multimedia \nstatements by Hizbollah, to consider all of the complaint\u2019s \nallegations, rather than considering each in isolation, and \nto accept as true all permissible inferences that could be \ndrawn from the complaint as a whole.\u201d Kaplan at 864-\n65. Second, it held prior U.S. designations are not \u201ca \nprerequisite for knowledge,\u201d as \u201cit would defy common \nsense to hold that such knowledge could be gained in no \nother way.\u201d Id. at 864.\nA. \t BLOM Provided Financial Services for Integral \nHamas Entities, \u201cClosely Intertwined\u201d with Its \nViolent Activities and Did so in Unusual Ways.\nMuch as LCB was alleged to have done in Kaplan, \nBLOM knowingly transferred millions of dollars for \nso-called charities that incentivized suicide bombings \nand encouraged violence; indeed, several are Specially \nDesignated Global Terrorists. For instance, BLOM \ndeposited millions of dollars from HLF, an SDGT and the \n\u201ccrown jewel in HAMAS\u2019s global fundraising network.\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a0563. Like Shahid in Kaplan, HLF:\nprovided crucial financial support for families \nof HAMAS suicide bombers, as well as the \nPalestinians who adhere to the HAMAS \nmovement. It is believed that by providing these \nannuities to families of HAMAS members, the \n[HLF] assists HAMAS by providing a constant \n\nAppendix J\n268a\nflow of suicide volunteers and buttresses a \nterrorist infrastructure heavily reliant on \nmoral support of the Palestinian populace.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \n[HLF\u2019s] mission is to support the families of \nthe martyrs.\n\u00b6\u00a0566. BLOM transferred these funds into the Hamas-\ncontrolled Sanabil and Subul al-Khair accounts, along \nwith funds from AAF, which Germany found in 2002 \u201ccalls \nfor violence\u201d to achieve Hamas\u2019s goals and the United \nStates called \u201ca critical part of HAMAS\u2019 terrorist support \ninfrastructure.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0552-54.\nSanabil, \u201cHamas\u2019s da\u2019wa headquarters in Lebanon,\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a0588, \u201creceive[d] large quantities of funds raised by major \nHAMAS-affiliated charities in Europe and the Middle \nEast and, in turn, provide[d] funding to HAMAS,\u201d and \nhelped \u201crecruit[] permanent members\u201d for Hamas. \u00b6\u00a0590. \nSubul al-Khair performed similar functions in the Beirut \narea, and \u201cwas identified as an unindicted co-conspirator \nin HLF\u2019s criminal trial.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0621-28. The Union of Good \nwas \u201cthe umbrella organization for HAMAS\u2019s global \nfundraising activity\u201d (its 50 constituent organizations \nincluded SDGTs Interpal and CBSP, \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0629-30) and acted \nas a broker for Hamas fundraising for \u201c[t]he primary \npurpose\u201d of \u201cstrengthen[ing] HAMAS\u2019 political and \nmilitary position in the West Bank and Gaza, including \nby [] diverting charitable donations to support HAMAS \nmembers and the families of terrorist operatives.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a063 5. In sum, the Three Customers and their various \ntransferors were \u201cclosely intertwined with [Hamas\u2019s] \nviolent terrorist activities,\u201d Kaplan at 860-61\u2014indeed, \n\nAppendix J\n269a\nthey were Hamas alter egos. The district court discounted \nthese allegations in finding \u201cno allegations whatsoever \nlink[ing] the Three Customers to Hamas\u2019 violent \nactivities.\u201d SPA-27.2\nAs in Kaplan, BLOM also permitted the Three \nCustomers to engage in non-routine conduct obscuring \ntheir uses for the funds they funneled for Hamas. As an \ninitial matter, this Court noted in Kaplan that \u201cwhether \na defendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is a \n\u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d Kaplan at 858 \n(quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327).3 But BLOM did not \njust provide financial services to the Three Customers \nknowing they belonged to an FTO\u2014it permitted at least \ntwo of them to withdraw funds in bulk cash.4 Rather than \n2.\u2002 This is not to say such allegations are always necessary: \nLCB\u2019s services for its other Hezbollah customers\u2014Yousser, \nBayt al-Mal, and their officers\u2014were not alleged to have direct \nconnections to Hezbollah violence per se, yet they constituted \nrelevant allegations supporting the Kaplan plaintiffs\u2019 claims. And \nwhile Shahid paid families of suicide bombers, the attacks at issue \nin Kaplan were rocket attacks, not suicide bombings.\n3.\u2002 This Court\u2019s Linde discussion refutes the district court\u2019s \nfinding that, under Linde, \u201cthe mere provision of routine banking \nservices to an FTO does not render a bank liable for civil aiding \nand abetting.\u201d SPA-17.\n4.\u2002 Plaintiffs here provided much more detailed allegations \nabout the millions of dollars in transfers BLOM processed for \nHamas than did the plaintiffs in Kaplan, where the allegations \nlargely described the scope of the cash-reporting exemptions LCB \noffered to Hezbollah entities, but offered few details on actual \ntransactions.\n\nAppendix J\n270a\npurchasing goods or services by check or wire transfer, as \na charity or business typically would, Sanabil and Subul \nal-Khair withdrew funds in untraceable bank notes. \n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0611, 613, 626, 628. As BLOM itself suggested, it never \n\u201cknew how Subul al-Khair [or Sanabil] used its cash once \nwithdrawn.\u201d Def. Mem. at 32.\nLarge cash withdrawals are a clear indicator of \ncriminal activity; for example, MENAFATF\u2014the agency \nreferenced in Kaplan at 849\u2014has explained that \u201c[c]ash \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. remains the raw material of most criminal activity. In \nmany cases, even when the proceeds of a crime are initially \ngenerated in electronic form .\u00a0.\u00a0. criminals choose to \nwithdraw the funds from a bank account in cash, transport \nit to another country, and pay it into another account in \norder to break an audit trail.\u201d5 BLOM suggests it may not \nhave found the withdrawals suspicious because it is \u201cat \nleast equally plausible that large cash withdrawals would \nbe needed to provide humanitarian aid\u201d in refugee camps, \nDef. Mem. at 32\u2014but (purportedly) \u201cequally plausible\u201d \ninferences of BLOM\u2019s beliefs about the uses of the cash \n(or its fungibility) favor plaintiffs on a 12(b)(6) motion. \nSee Kaplan at 854 (\u201cThe plausibility standard is not akin \nto a \u2018probability requirement,\u2019 but it asks for more than a \nsheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d) \n(citation omitted).\n5.\u2002 MENAFATF, \u201cMoney Laundering Through the Physical \nTransportation of Cash,\u201d at 3 (Oct. 2015), available at https://www.\nfatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/money-laundering-\nthrough-transportation-cash.pdf.\n\nAppendix J\n271a\nIndeed, Hamas used Lebanon as a political and \nfundraising base, both for competing with its rivals \nHezbollah and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n(\u201cPLO\u201d), and for funneling funds to its operational \ncomponents in the Palestinian Territories. As Plaintiffs \nalleged:\nFor example, senior HAMAS activist Jamal \nal-Tawil, who was one of the Movement\u2019s most \nimportant operatives in the Ramallah area, \nwas arrested by Israel in 2002 and later told \nhis interrogators that he received $12,000 per \nmonth from HAMAS\u2019s leadership in Lebanon. \nOther notorious HAMAS operatives in the \nPalestinian Territories ranging from Abbas \nal-Sayed (mastermind of the Park Hotel suicide \nbombing in Netanya) to Jamal Mansur, one \nof HAMAS\u2019s senior operatives in Nablus to \nSheikh Ahmed Yassin himself, received funds \ntransfers from representatives of HAMAS\u2019s \nbureau in Lebanon.\n\u00b6\u00a0587. Untraceable funds thus went to, or freed up funds \nthat went to, the Palestinian Territories.\nThe district court instead pointed to the stated \ncharitable purposes given by AAF, Sanabil, and other \ndesignated terrorists on their transfers or other \ndocumentation.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n11: 20240529131848973_Blom20Bank20PFC20Apx20PDFA.json (score: 0.308)\nAPPENDIX \n\ni\nAPPENDIX\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAppendix A Summary Order and Judgment in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit, Honickman v.

WESLEY, \nBETH ROBINSON,\nCircuit Judges.\nFOR APPELLANTS: \nMICHAEL RADINE (Gary M. Osen,\nAaron Schlanger, on the brief),\nOsen LLC, Hackensack, NY. \nFOR APPELLEE: \nMICHAEL MCGINLEY, Dechert LLP,\nPhiladelphia, PA. \nAppeal from a judgment of the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York\n(Matsumoto, Judge). \n\nApp. 5\nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT\nIS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\nDECREED that the district court\u2019s order entered on\nApril 8, 2022 is VACATED and the case is\nREMANDED for further proceedings. \nPlaintiffs-Appellants are victims and their family\nmembers of attacks carried out by HAMAS, a group the\nUnited States has designated as a foreign terrorist\norganization. In January 2019, Plaintiffs sued\nDefendant-Appellee BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM Bank\u201d)\nfor aiding and abetting HAMAS by providing financial\nservices to certain customers Plaintiffs allege are\naffiliated with HAMAS, in violation of the Anti-\nTerrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333, as amended by the\nJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d),\nid. \u00a7 2333(d)(2). A year later, the district court\ndismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted. Honickman for\nEstate of Goldstein v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 F. Supp.\n3d 253, 271 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (\u201cHonickman I\u201d). \nOn appeal, a panel of this Court concluded that the\ndistrict court applied the wrong legal standard for\naiding-and-abetting \nliability \nunder \nJASTA.\nNonetheless, we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment\nbecause Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint still failed to state a claim\nunder the correct standard. Honickman v. BLOM Bank\nSAL, 6 F.4th 487, 490 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cHonickman II\u201d).\nArmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs\nreturned to the district court and moved under Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to vacate\nthe judgment of dismissal and grant them leave to file\na first amended complaint. The court denied Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nApp. 6\nmotion in an April 2022 order, Honickman v. BLOM\nBank SAL, No. 19-CV-0008, 2022 WL 1062315, at *5\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2022) (\u201cHonickman III\u201d), which\nPlaintiffs now appeal. We assume the parties\u2019\nfamiliarity with the underlying facts, procedural\nhistory, and arguments on appeal, to which we refer\nonly as necessary to explain our decision to vacate and\nremand. \nWe review for abuse of discretion both a district\ncourt\u2019s \u201cdenial of a motion to vacate a judgment under\nRule 60(b)(6)\u201d and its \u201cdenial of a post-judgment motion\nfor leave to replead.\u201d Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88\nF.4th 353, 359 (2d Cir. 2023).1 That means \u201cwe must\naffirm the denial of vacatur, unless the ruling is based\non an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d Id. Where, as\nhere, plaintiffs \u201cseek to file a first amended complaint\n. . . it is an abuse of discretion to deny post judgment\nrelief \u2018without any justifying reason,\u2019 such as \u2018undue\ndelay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the\nmovant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by\namendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to\nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the\namendment, [or] futility of amendment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 362\n(quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). \nWe conclude that the district court exceeded its\ndiscretion by basing its ruling on an erroneous view of\n1 In quotations from case law and the parties\u2019 briefing, this opinion\nomits all internal quotation marks, alterations, footnotes, and\ncitations, unless otherwise noted. \n\nApp. 7\nthe law because it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality\nprinciples and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal pleading principles.2\nA plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to Rule 60(b)(6)\nrelief \n\u201conly \nwhen \nthere \nare \nextraordinary\ncircumstances justifying relief, when the judgment may\nwork an extreme and undue hardship, and when the\nasserted grounds for relief are not recognized in clauses\n(1)\u2013(5) of the Rule.\u201d Metzler Investment Gmbh v.\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir.\n2020). But \u201c[w]hen vacatur is sought in order to obtain\nleave \nto \nfile \nan \namended \ncomplaint, \nspecial\nconsiderations come into play.\u201d Mandala, 88 F.4th at\n361. In such cases, the district court must give \u201cdue\nregard\u201d to \u201cboth the philosophy favoring finality of\njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of\nRule 15(a).\u201d Id. Therefore, when presented with a\nmotion to vacate and amend, the district court is\nrequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a)\nliberality in tandem. \nHere, the district court evaluated Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard. The court concluded\nthat it \u201cwould be contradictory to entertain a motion to\namend the complaint\u201d under Rule 15(a) without \u201ca\nvalid basis to vacate the previously entered judgment\u201d\nunder Rule 60(b). Honickman III, 2022 WL 1062315, at\n*2 n.2. As a result, it incorrectly treated Plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion to vacate and amend as calling for two distinct\n2 Because \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d which is a legal term of art, can\napply to determinations that do not involve \u201c\u2018abuse\u2019 in the ordinary\nsense of the word,\u201d we use the more precise term \u201cexceeded\u201d to\ndescribe the same thing. JTH Tax, LLC v. Agnant, 62 F.4th 658,\n666 n.1 (2d Cir. 2023).\n\nApp. 8\nanalyses, requiring Plaintiffs to successfully navigate\nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they could invoke\nRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy. The district\ncourt\u2019s framework for analyzing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was\nerroneous as a matter of law. \nWe accordingly vacate the district court\u2019s order and\nremand the case for the court to reconsider Plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion applying the above standards. In doing so, the\ndistrict court should balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and\nRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies, and it should\nexamine all the \u201cspecial considerations [that] come into\nplay\u201d \u201c[w]hen vacatur is sought in order to obtain leave\nto file an amended complaint.\u201d Mandala, 88 F.4th at\n361. Our discussion of the various considerations in\nMandala will be particularly helpful to the district\ncourt\u2019s analysis. Id. at 361\u201365. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s order\nis VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this summary\norder. \nFOR THE COURT: \nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court \n/s/ Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe\n\nApp. 9\n                         \nAPPENDIX B\n                         \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n19-CV-0008 (KAM)(SMG) \n[Filed April 8, 2022]\n_____________________\nHONICKMAN, et al,\n)\nPlaintiffs, \n)\n)\nv. \n)\n)\nBLOM BANK SAL, \n)\nDefendant. \n)\n____________________ )\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nKIYO A.

Plaintiffs commenced this\naction pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as\namended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism\nAct (\u201cJASTA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d), to recover damages\nfrom BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM,\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) for\nallegedly aiding and abetting Hamas\u2019 commission of\nterrorist acts by providing financial services to Hamas\n\nApp. 10\nthrough three of BLOM\u2019s customers who are alleged to\nbe Hamas affiliates: the Sanabil Association for Relief\nand Development (\u201cSanabil\u201d), Subul Al-Khair, and the\nUnion \nof \nGood \n(collectively, \nBLOM\u2019s \n\u201cThree\nCustomers\u201d). \nThis case has been closed since January 15, 2020,\nfollowing this Court\u2019s order granting Defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss and the entry of judgment.

Presently before the Court is\nPlaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the Judgment of this Court\nwhich dismissed their Complaint with prejudice after\nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel twice declined the Court\u2019s offer to\ngrant leave to amend. (ECF No. 44, Jan. 14, 2020\nOrder; ECF No. 45, Judgment.) For the reasons\ndiscussed \nfurther \nbelow, \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion \nis\nrespectfully DENIED. \nBACKGROUND1\nPlaintiffs twice expressly declined the opportunity\nto amend their complaint prior to the Court\u2019s decision\ndated January 14, 2020: 1) on May 15, 2019 at the pre-\nmotion conference (Tr. 6:9\u201324, May 15, 2019), and 2) on\nNovember 25, 2019, at oral argument on the motion to\ndismiss. (See ECF No. 50, Pls. Pre-Motion Conference\nReq., p. 1.) On January 14, 2020, this Court issued an\nOrder granting Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice pursuant to\n1 The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts, the\npreceding procedural history, and the scope of issues presented\nbefore this Court and on appeal before the Second Circuit.\n\nApp. 11\nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. (See ECF No. 44, Order; see also ECF No. 45,\nJudgment.) Plaintiffs appealed this Court\u2019s Order and\nthe accompanying Judgment to the Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit on February 13, 2020. (ECF\nNo. 46.) On July 29, 2021, the Second Circuit in\nHonickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 6 F.4th 487 (2d Cir.\n2021), affirmed this Court\u2019s Order and judgment of\ndismissal (ECF No. 44) in Honickman for Est. of\nGoldstein v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 F. Supp. 3d 253\n(E.D.N.Y. 2020), albeit after applying a different\nstandard. Following the Second Circuit\u2019s affirmance of\nthis Court\u2019s Order, Plaintiffs filed a request for a pre-\nmotion conference on August 9, 2021, in anticipation of\ntheir motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and\n60(b)(6) to vacate the judgment and for leave to file an\namended complaint. (ECF No. 50.) Defendant opposed\nthis request. (ECF No. 51.) \nOn October 6, 2021, the Court held a pre-motion\nconference regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed motions to\n1) vacate the judgment of this Court dismissing their\nComplaint with prejudice; and 2) amend the Complaint\nthat was previously dismissed. The Court granted the\nparties leave to file written submissions only as to the\nissue of vacatur. On December 7, 2021, the Court\ngranted the parties a second opportunity to file\naccurate submissions. On December 13, 2021, Plaintiffs\nfiled a Memorandum in Support of their Motion to\nVacate Judgment (ECF No. 70), and Defendants filed\na Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Vacate\nJudgment. (ECF No. 69.) On January 3, 2022,\nPlaintiffs filed a Reply in Support of their Motion (ECF\n\nApp. 12\nNo. 73), and Defendants filed a Reply in Opposition to\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion. (ECF No. 72.) \nLEGAL STANDARD\nIt is well established that \u201c[a] party seeking to file\nan amended complaint post[-]judgment must first have\nthe judgment vacated or set aside pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 59(e) or 60(b).\u201d Metzler Inv. Gmbh v. Chipotle\nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2020)\n(citing Ruotolo v. City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 191\n(2d Cir. 2008)).2\nRule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nallows a district court to relieve a party from a\njudgment under any one of five specified reasons, none\nof which are applicable (see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5)),\nor under the sixth catch-all provision under\nRule 60(b)(6), for \u201cany other reason [that] justif[ies]\nrelief[.]\u201d Simone v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 164 F.\nApp\u2019x 39, 40 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 60(b)(6)). Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cproperly invoked only\nwhen there are extraordinary circumstances justifying\nrelief\u201d or \u201cwhen the judgment may work an extreme\nand undue hardship,\u201d Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58,\n63 (2d Cir. 1986). The Second Circuit has cautioned\n2 Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 15, it \u201cwould be contradictory to entertain a motion to\namend the complaint\u201d without \u201ca valid basis to vacate the\npreviously entered judgment.\u201d Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. of Iran v.\nM/T Stolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991). \u201cTo hold\notherwise would enable the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a)\nto be employed in a way that is contrary to the philosophy favoring\nfinality of judgments and the expeditious termination of litigation.\u201d\nMetzler, 970 F.3d at 142 (citations omitted).\n\nApp. 13\nthat \u201cmotions under Rule 60(b) are disfavored.\u201d\nSimone, 164 F. App\u2019x at 40 (citing Pichardo v. Ashcroft,\n374 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 2004)). The \u201cburden of proof is\non the party seeking relief\u201d from the judgment.\nPichardo, 374 F.3d at 55 (citation omitted). \nDISCUSSION\nFor the following reasons, the Court concludes that\nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated that relief under\nRule 60(b)(6) is warranted. As a preliminary matter,\nthe Second Circuit in Honickman affirmed this Court\u2019s\nJanuary 14, 2020, Order of dismissal, and in doing so\nspecifically held, \n[b]ecause [...] Plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege\nBLOM Bank was aware the Three Customers\nwere related to Hamas, [the Second Circuit does]\nnot need to consider whether they plausibly\nalleged the Three Customers were closely\nintertwined with Hamas\u2019s violent terrorist\nactivities. Nor do[es] [the Second Circuit] need to\naddress whether the complaint satisfies the\nsubstantial assistance element. The complaint\u2019s\nfailure to support a reasonable inference that\nBLOM Bank knew of the Three Customers\u2019 links\nto Hamas sounds the death knell of Plaintiffs\u2019\nJASTA aiding-and-abetting liability action. \nHonickman, 6 F.4th at 503. With regard to Plaintiffs\u2019\naiding-and-ability liability claim, the Court of Appeals\n\u201cacknowledge[d] that the district court\u2019s decision came\nbefore [the Second Circuit\u2019s] opinion in Kaplan [v.\nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir.\n2021)] clarified the import of our earlier JASTA aiding-\n\nApp. 14\nand-abetting precedents which may have generated\nsome \nambiguity \nas \nto \nthe \nproper \nstandard.\u201d\nHonickman, 6 F.4th at 497, n. 11. \nSecond, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary \ncircumstances\nwarranting \nrelief \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6). \nGiven\nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s potentially \u201csweeping reach, courts\nrequire the party seeking to avail itself of the Rule to\ndemonstrate \nthat \n\u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019\nwarrant relief.\u201d Stevens v. Miller, 676 F.3d 62, 67 (2d\nCir. 2012) (citing Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition\nCorp., 486 U.S. 847, 864, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d\n855 (1988); Nemaizer, 793 F.2d at 63). \nDespite the Second Circuit holding in Honickman,\n6 F.4th at 503, that Plaintiffs\u2019 aiding-and-abetting\nclaim must fail, Plaintiffs argue in support of vacatur\nthat this \u201cCourt should give Plaintiffs the opportunity\nto meet what the Circuit called the \u2018correct standard.\u2019\u201d\n(ECF No. 50, Pls. Req. for Pre-Motion Conference, p. 1.)\nPlaintiffs\u2019 unavailing argument that the Second\nCircuit\u2019s clarification of the aiding-and-abetting\nstandard constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d\nignores the long-settled proposition in the Second\nCircuit that \u201cas a general matter, a mere change in\ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary\ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d\nEmpresa Cubana Del Tabaco v. Gen. Cigar Co. Inc.,\n385 F. App\u2019x 29, 32 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Pichardo, 374\nF.3d at 56; see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203,\n239, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997)\n(\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves\nrarely constitute the extraordinary circumstances\n\nApp. 15\nrequired for relief under Rule 60(b)(6)....\u201d)).3 The\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the judgment of dismissal\nof the complaint. This Court does not consider the\nclarification by the Second Circuit of the standard for\na successful aiding-and-abetting claim to constitute\nextraordinary circumstances meriting vacatur of this\nCourt\u2019s prior Judgment, which the Second Circuit\naffirmed after applying the clarified standard.\nPlaintiffs fail to raise any other allegedly extraordinary\ncircumstances, and do not show that any of their\nproposed new allegations were unavailable to them\nwhen given the opportunity to amend the complaint\nprior to this Court\u2019s decision on Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss. \nThird, although this Court is deeply sympathetic to\nthe Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs have not satisfied this Court\nthat denying the instant motion for vacatur would\nresult in \u201can extreme and undue hardship[.]\u201d Nemaizer,\n3 Moreover, even if changes in decisional law were appropriate\nbases for vacatur, it is not clear to this Court that the deficiencies\nidentified in Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint by this Court and the Court of\nAppeals would be impacted by the Second Circuit\u2019s clarified\nstandard for aiding-and-abetting claims. Even under the clarified\nstandard, this Court\u2019s ruling that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not\nplausibly allege that BLOM was generally aware of any connection\nbetween the Three Customers and Hamas\u201d is not meaningfully\ndifferent from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling as to this same basis for\naffirming this Court\u2019s dismissal. See Honickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d\nat 265; see also Honickman, 6 F.4th at 501 (the Second Circuit held\nthat \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 aiding-and-abetting claim fails because the\nallegations do not support an inference that BLOM Bank was\naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the\nrelevant attacks, thereby undermining the second element of\ngeneral awareness.\u201d). \n\nApp. 16\n793 F.2d at 63. Plaintiffs only summarily argue that\nthey would be \u201c[p]rejudiced and [d]efendant [w]ould\n[n]ot,\u201d and focus instead on the lack of prejudice for\nDefendant in continuing litigation if Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor vactur were granted. (ECF No. 70, Pls. Mem.,\npp. 26-27.) Fundamentally, Plaintiffs seek to amend\ntheir complaint after declining two prior opportunities\nto do so, and after unsuccessfully appealing the\ndismissal of that complaint with prejudice.4 Plaintiffs\nwill not be prejudiced by the ultimate conclusion of this\nlitigation, as Plaintiffs have had ample opportunity to\npursue all legal avenues available to them for relief.\nIndeed, Plaintiffs asserted in their opposition to the\nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that this Court should\napply the standard subsequently clarified by the\nSecond Circuit in Kaplan, 999 F.3d 842, and in the\nHonickman appeal, and the Circuit ruled in the instant\nappeal that even applying the clarified standard, the\ndismissal of the complaint was affirmed. (ECF No. 37,\nPl. Opp. Mem. pp. 10-23.) \nRelatedly, Plaintiffs concede that they twice\ndeclined the opportunity to amend their Complaint\nbefore this Court dismissed it. (ECF No. 50 at 1.) At the\nMay 15, 2019, Pre-Motion Conference, \u201c[t]he Court\noffered Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their\ncomplaint[] to add additional information in response\n4 Defendant correctly notes that Plaintiffs never appealed the\n\u201cwith prejudice\u201d aspect of the dismissal, and accordingly, waived\nit. (See ECF No. 72, p. 3); see also 18A Charles Alan Wright &\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed.\n2021) (\u201cA party who elects to appeal on one issue, omitting another\nissue on which it lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not\nappealed.\u201d). \n\nApp. 17\nto the arguments raised by Defendant. Plaintiffs\ndeclined to do so and represented that they would not\nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d\n(Min. Entry, May 15, 2019.) The Court specifically\nasked Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during the pre-motion\nconference: \u201cAre there any additional facts you could\nadd to the allegations that the defendant is challenging\nhere or are you comfortable standing on your complaint\nas it is?\u201d (Tr. 6:9\u201311, May 15, 2019.)5 Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nexpressly declined the Court\u2019s invitation to amend the\ncomplaint, stating \u201c[n]o, I think we are prepared to\nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d (Id. at 6:15\u201316.) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again\nconfirmed that Plaintiffs would not seek leave to\namend if the Court granted Defendant\u2019s motion,\nstating, \u201csitting here today based on what was\nrepresented as the arguments in the pre-motion letter,\nwe would not seek leave to amend.\u201d (Id. at 6:22\u201324.)\nSubsequently, on No\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n17: 20241209152644306_No.2023-125920Affidavit20for20Joint20Appendix.json (score: 0.305)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-1259 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \nBLOM BANK SAL, \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nMICHAL HONICKMAN, ET AL., \nRespondents. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK  \n) \n  \n                   \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK \n) \n \nI, Mariana Braylovskiy, being duly sworn according to law and being \nover the age of 18, upon my oath depose and say that: \n \nI am retained by Counsel of Record for Petitioner. \n \nThat on the 9th day of December, 2024, I served the within Joint \nAppendix  in the above-captioned matter upon: \n \nMichael Jacob Radine \nOsen LLC \n190 Moore Street, Suite 272 \nHackensack, NJ 07601 \n201-265-6400 \nmradine@osenlaw.com \n \nCounsel for Respondents \n \nby sending three copies of same, addressed to each individual respectively, \nthrough FedEx Overnight Mail.

As the Opening Brief \nexplained, that outlier approach lacks any basis in \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or context.  It puts Rule 60(b) at \nwar with itself on multiple fronts.  It subverts the \nguiding principles of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  And it contradicts this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThose decisions confirm that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022).  \u201cEven then, \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nmust justify [the] reopening\u201d of a final judgment.  Id. \n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11 (1988)).  And a party\u2019s \u201cfree, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 \n(1950).  Rather, the party must be wholly \u201cfaultless in \nthe delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993). \nRespondents largely ignore these foundational \nprinciples.  That is because they cannot salvage the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s backwards approach or the mess it \nwould make of Rule 60(b) and the Federal Rules more \nbroadly.  Instead, Respondents try to avoid the Second \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, insisting that the court did not \nactually \u201c\u2018jettison\u2019 the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard\u201d and, in fact, \u201cd[id] not \u2018hold\u2019 anything.\u201d  \nResp.Br.22, 25 (citation omitted). \nThey are wrong on both points.  The Second Circuit \nexpressly abandoned the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard, and it held that the District Court erred by \napplying it.  In doing so, the Second Circuit \n\n2 \n \nacknowledged that a \u201cplaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \nRule 60(b)(6) relief \u2018only when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying relief.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  \u201cBut,\u201d according to the \nSecond Circuit, the standard changes when \u201c\u2018vacatur \nis sought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023)).  In that \ncase, the Second Circuit believed that \u201c\u2018special \nconsiderations come into play\u2019\u201d that \u201crequire[] [district \ncourts] to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem.\u201d  Id. (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 361).  Based on that mistaken view of the Federal \nRules, the Second Circuit held that the District Court \nabused its discretion by evaluating Respondents\u2019 Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nThis Court should reverse and hold that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when it \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar to deny relief.  Indeed, \nRespondents\u2019 \nsuggestion \nthat \nextraordinary \ncircumstances exist here only underscores the \nproblems with the Second Circuit\u2019s test.  Everything \nthey point to sounds in \u201cmistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  \nAs a result, Rule 60(b)(6) relief is categorically \nunavailable to them.  Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s one-year deadline \ninstead applies\u2014and it expired before Respondents \nfiled their motion. \nRespondents\u2019 repeated and deliberate waivers also \nforeclose post-judgment relief.  They do not dispute \n\u201cthat they twice declined the opportunity to amend \ntheir Complaint before [the District] Court dismissed \nit,\u201d only to then \u201cwaive[]\u201d any challenge to the \u201c\u2018with \n\n3 \n \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal\u201d on appeal.  \nPet.App.16 & n.4.  Nor do they dispute that it would \nhave been \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d for the lower courts \nto \u201coverride a [litigant\u2019s] deliberate waiver.\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  That should be the end of the matter.  \nRespondents chose to stand or fall on their complaint \nas pled and unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.   \nRespondents gloss over these facts by claiming that \n\u201cthe Second Circuit did not find any waiver.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court did, and the Second \nCircuit nowhere disagreed.  It nonetheless refused to \nuphold the District Court\u2019s decision\u2014notwithstanding \nthe waivers\u2014because the District Court had not given \n\u201cdue regard\u201d to \u201cthe liberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  \nThat was error.  Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d of \ntheir litigation choices merely \u201cbecause hindsight \nseems to indicate\u201d that those decisions were ill-\nadvised.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199.  Thus, Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201chas no application to [this] situation.\u201d  Id. at \n202.  And, because a final judgment is in place, neither \ndoes Rule 15(a). \nThis Court should reverse the decision below, \nreinstate the District Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 \nRule 60(b) motion, and bring this case to an end. \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must Satisfy \nRule 60(b)\u2019s Stringent Standards. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test dilutes Rule \n60(b)\u2019s exacting requirements for post-judgment relief \nwithout any basis in text, context, or precedent.  \nRespondents ignore the glaring problems with that \napproach.  And their arguments only highlight the \nflaws in the decision below. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires \u201cExtraordinary \nCircumstances\u201d Not Covered by Any Other \nProvision of Rule 60(b). \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have \nbeen analyzed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard.  This \nCourt has consistently \u201crequired a movant seeking \nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 \n(2005) (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.Br.23 (collecting cases).  This Court has also long \nstressed that Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d \nwith the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b).  \nLiljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  The Rule\u2019s text and \nstructure dictate both of these principles.  See \nPet.Br.23, 27-28, 31-34.  Yet the decision below flouts \nthem.  And Respondents provide no basis to discard \nthese basic requirements where plaintiffs seek to \nrevive their case with an amended complaint. \nPerhaps recognizing the Second Circuit\u2019s misstep, \nRespondents start off by suggesting that the court did \nnot \u201cabandon[] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \n\n5 \n \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry.\u201d  \nResp.Br.24 (citation omitted).  But that is wrong.  The \ndecision below rebuked the \u201cordinar[y]\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) \nstandard for one that \u201cbalance[s] Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Pet.App.8 (holding \nthat the District Court\u2019s extraordinary circumstances \n\u201cframework for analyzing [Respondents\u2019] motion was \nerroneous as a matter of law\u201d). \nThat analytical mistake was compelled by Second \nCircuit \nprecedent. \n \nIn \nMandala, \nthe \ncourt \nacknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test.  \n88 F.4th at 361.  But then it cast that standard aside \nto hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to amend, a district \ncourt abuses its discretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment \nrelief\u201d based solely on the movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to \ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief under Rule \n60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  That makes no sense.  As Judge \nSullivan countered in his Mandala dissent, \u201cit is \nbeyond cavil that a party\u2019s failure to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances is alone a sufficient \njustification for denying postjudgment relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 369 n.2 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  \nThat is, after all, the standard for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  \nAnd it is the standard that should have applied here. \nRespondents then later pull an about face, \nacknowledging that the Second Circuit did apply a \n\u201cbalancing test\u201d that imports \u201cthe policies embodied in \nRule 15(a)\u201d into the vacatur analysis.  Resp.Br.25 \n(quotation marks omitted).  But they offer no \npersuasive defense of that misguided approach. \n\n6 \n \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Balancing Test \nLacks Any Precedential Support. \nRespondents cannot ground the Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test in the text or context of Rule 60(b)(6).  \nAccordingly, \nthey \nspend \nover \na \ndozen \npages \nmeandering through caselaw (at 25-38) in an effort to \ndownplay the novelty of that outlier position.  But they \nconcede that other decisions are \u201cout of step\u201d with the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  Resp.Br.33.  And \nRespondents do not rely on any case that helps them. \nRespondents fumble (at 27) for support in Krupski \nv. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538 (2010).  But \nthat case addressed the scope of \u201crelation back under \nRule 15(c)(1)(C),\u201d as defined by \u201cthe text of the Rule.\u201d  \nId. at 541, 547.  Krupski said nothing about the proper \nstandard for reopening a judgment under Rule 60(b).  \nThat is the Rule that governs \u201cRelief from a Final \nJudgment, Order, or Proceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nRespondents also double down (at 26-27) on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But they concede that \ncase involved a motion \u201cunder Rule 59(e), not Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Resp.Br.27 n.3.  As explained in the Opening \nBrief, that distinction matters.  See Pet.Br.34-35.  And \nwhile Respondents try to characterize the specific rule \nin Foman as \u201ccompletely irrelevant to this Court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d Resp.Br.27 n.3, that is not true.  The proper \nstandard for a Rule 60(b) motion was not before the \nFoman Court, and Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) impose \n\u201cdifferent standards\u201d for relief \u201cby their own terms.\u201d  \nDaulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. \n2024).  Hence, the Rule 59(e) motion in Foman was \n\u201cnot controlled by the same exacting substantive \nrequirements\u201d codified in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  Priester v. \n\n7 \n \nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 927 F.3d 912, 913 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   \nNor is it surprising that the standards would differ \nbetween the two rules.  They serve markedly different \nfunctions.  A Rule 59(e) motion operates as \u201ca limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding\u201d and plays \u201ca \npart [in] producing the final judgment,\u201d whereas a \nRule 60(b) motion \u201cthreaten[s] an already final \njudgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 519, 521 (2020); see Pet.Br.34-35.  \nRule 60(b) thus naturally poses a higher bar for relief. \nRespondents next trumpet (at 29-31, 33, 35-38) a \nparade of lower court decisions.  But those cases, \nobviously, do not control this Court\u2019s analysis.  And \nmost of them similarly addressed Rule 59(e) motions, \nnot Rule 60(b) motions.1  So, they are simply off-point \nas well.  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are not fungible, and \nRespondents fail to offer any reason to merge the two \ntextually and functionally distinct rules into one. \nNor do any of the few 60(b) cases that Respondents \nlean on (at 29-30) provide them any support.  Those \ndecisions merely recognize that the Rules\u2019 drafters \nalready balanced the needs for \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \n \n1  See, e.g., Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. \n& Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 2015); NewSpin Sports, \nLLC v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d 293, 299 (7th Cir. 2018); \nUnited States ex rel.

Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, \n1133 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  None suggests \nthat courts should then smuggle in Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading principles as an additional variable to tip \nthe scales against finality under Rule 60(b).  The \nSecond Circuit stands alone by imposing that \nextratextual requirement.2 \nRespondents also rely heavily on United States v. \nMask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nBut that was a Rule 60(b)(1) case, not a Rule 60(b)(6) \ncase.  See id. at 743.  And it only further illustrates \nwhy Respondents are wrong here.  Like every other \nCourt of Appeals, see Pet.Br.21 n.3, the Eighth Circuit \nthere held that courts may grant leave to amend only \nif doing so \u201cis consistent with the stringent standards \ngoverning the grant of . . . Rule 60(b) relief,\u201d 752 F.3d \n \n2  Other decisions cited by Respondents do not address either \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions.  See, e.g., Gondeck v. Pan Am. \nWorld Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, 26-28 (1965); Jack v. Evonik \nCorp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 (5th Cir. 2023); Tate v.

DeLuca, 545 \nF.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008) (no waiver by plaintiff, who filed a \ncombined Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motion just a week after the \ndistrict court terminated the case without warning). \n\n9 \n \nat 743.  It then affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of \npost-judgment relief where, as here, the plaintiff \n\u201cknew many months prior to the Order of Dismissal of \nthe possible need to amend its pleading and elected to \n\u2018stand or fall\u2019\u201d on its complaint.  Id. at 744; see \nPet.App.15-18.  The Second Circuit should have \nreached the same result. \nFinally, Respondents cobble together (at 37) a trio \nof this Court\u2019s precedents that have nothing to do with \nthe question presented in this case.  None even \nmentions Rule 60(b), let alone purports to analyze the \nproper standard for a plaintiff seeking relief from a \nfinal judgment.  Nor did they have occasion to do so.  \nIn Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 \nU.S. 308, 329 (2007), this Court merely remanded for \napplication of a legal standard to the facts alleged.  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 666 (2009), this Court \nconfronted an \u201cinterlocutory appeal,\u201d not an appeal \nfrom a final judgment.  And in Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014), this Court \u201creversed\u201d \nan improper dismissal, meaning there was no longer a \nfinal judgment on remand. \nHere, by contrast, Respondents seek to set aside a \ndismissal with prejudice that was affirmed on appeal.  \nPet.App.49-53.  A final judgment remains in place.  \nThus, Respondents must \u201csatisfy one of the Rule 60(b) \ngrounds before [the] court may consider [a] motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 178.  \u201cThe permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant\u201d until they make that showing.  Garrett \nv. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019).  The \nSecond Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \n\n10 \n \n2. Respondents\u2019 Other Arguments Are \nMeritless. \nBeyond citing inapposite precedents, Respondents \nsay little else to defend the decision below.  They do \nnot suggest that the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nfinds any support in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  They do not rely \non the Rule\u2019s history or structure.  They do not dispute \nthat the decision below thwarts the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nAnd they do not explain how it is \u201cjust\u201d to relieve \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices\u2014which \nwould burden both defendants and the courts with \nduplicative litigation.  Id.; see Pet.Br.37; Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 369 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). \nNor do Respondents grapple with the many ways \nin which the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test clashes \nwith other provisions of Rule 60(b).  See Pet.Br.31-34.  \nThey do not dispute that it enables plaintiffs to evade \nRule 60\u2019s strict time limitations where allegations are \nomitted by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), \n(c)(1).  Nor do they explain why plaintiffs could wield \nRule 60(b)(6) to introduce previously available facts \nyears after judgment, when Rule 60 elsewhere limits \nrelief to matters \u201cnewly discovered\u201d within a year of \njudgment that \u201ccould not have been discovered\u201d before \nwith \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test invites that internal \ninconsistency.  See Mandala, 88 F.4th at 365 (ordering \nvacatur and amendment \u201cbased on information that \nwas publicly available for years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint\u201d). \nAs to mistake, Respondents claim that \u201cthe Second \nCircuit has never suggested that vacatur and \n\n11 \n \namendment are permissible where a complaint failed \ndue to counsel\u2019s mistake.\u201d  Resp.Br.43.  But, even \nsetting aside the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) is not limited \nto counsel\u2019s mistakes, see Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534-35, \nthe Second Circuit has required just that.  It deployed \nits balancing test in Mandala to compel the reopening \nof a final judgment, even though the \u201cvacatur motion \nar[ose] from a legal mistake based on insufficient \npleading.\u201d  88 F.4th at 360.  That is precisely \nRespondents\u2019 theory here too\u2014that they made a legal \nmistake as to which facts they needed to allege to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s statutory standard.  See Resp.Br.45.3 \nRetreating from Rule 60(b), Respondents note that \nRule 15 \u201ccontemplates two stages of amendment\u2014\nbefore trial and during or after trial.\u201d  Resp.Br.42.  Yet, \nthey fail to explain why that might bear on the \nthreshold vacatur inquiry, which necessarily occurs in \nthe post-judgment context.  At that point, \u201c[t]he suit is \nover.\u201d  Pe\u00f1a v. Mattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996).  \n\u201cThere is no complaint to amend.\u201d  Id.  And \nRespondents concede \u201cthat Rule 15(a) \u2018does not \nprovide a mechanism for amending pleadings after \ndismissal.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.42 (quoting Pet.Br.30).  Rather, \nRule 60(b) defines the \u201climited set of circumstances\u201d \nthat might allow the losing party to \u201crequest \nreopening of his case.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  \n \n3  To be clear, Respondents\u2019 proposed amendments still \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This is a complaint for damages arising out of the \nunlawful conduct of BLOM BANK (previously known \nas \u201cBanque du Liban et D\u2019Outre Mer\u201d) \u2013 a Lebanese \nbank headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon. BLOM BANK \naided and abetted the Islamic Resistance Movement \n(\u201cHAMAS\u201d), a Foreign Terrorist Organization (\u201cFTO\u201d) \n(as that term is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 1189 of the \nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d)) by knowingly providing substantial assistance \nto HAMAS in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d) of the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), and is civilly liable under \u00a7\u00a02333(d) \nof the ATA to those American citizens (and their estates, \nsurvivors and heirs) who have been killed or injured in \ntheir person, property or business by reason of such acts \nof international terrorism perpetrated by HAMAS.\n2. BLOM BANK knowingly \u2013 and with awareness of \nits important role \u2013 provided financial services to HAMAS \nin several related ways set forth below, by maintaining \naccounts for, and facilitating substantial payments on \nbehalf of, HAMAS\u2019s Lebanese institutions, most notably \nthe Sanabil Association for Relief and Development \n(\u201cSanabil\u201d), which was designated by the U.S. Department \nof the Treasury as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist \n(\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003.\n\nAppendix A\n5a\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over \nthis civil action brought by citizens of the United States \nwho have been killed or injured by reason of acts of \ninternational terrorism, and/or their estates, survivors, \nand heirs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01331 and 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a02333(a), 2333(d), and 2338.\n4. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a02334(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01391(b).\n5. BLOM BANK is subject to personal jurisdiction \nin New York pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 2334(a), N.Y. \nCPLR \u00a7\u00a0302, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)-(2) because it \nhas transacted business during the relevant period and \ncommitted tortious acts within the United States during \nthe relevant period by transferring funds through the \nUnited States for the benefit of HAMAS.\n6. As set forth below, BLOM BANK purposefully used \nits multiple correspondent bank accounts at U.S. financial \ninstitutions, including its accounts at Bank of New York, \nCitibank NA and American Express Bank Ltd. in New \nYork to provide financial services to HAMAS, including \nfacilitating the transfer of millions of U.S. dollars through \nthe United States on HAMAS\u2019s behalf or for HAMAS\u2019s \nbenefit.\n\nAppendix A\n6a\nTHE PARTIES\nA. \t The Plaintiffs\n7. The Second Intifada (\u201cal-Quds\u201d or \u201cal-Aqsa \nIntifada\u201d), which broke out in Israel and the Palestinian \nTerritories in September 2000, was a key turning point \nin HAMAS\u2019s history.\n8. In the initial weeks of the Second Intifada, large \ndemonstrations were organized in several Palestinian \ncities. On October 12, 2000, a Palestinian mob in Ramallah \nattacked two off- duty Israeli reservists, lynched them, \nand celebrated their deaths \u2013 with much of the scene \ncaptured on camera.\n9. Soon thereafter, HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic \nJihad (\u201cPIJ\u201d), the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine (\u201cPFLP\u201d) and the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ruling \nfaction, Fatah, all launched attacks on Israeli civilian \ncenters, military installations, vehicles, and civilians \nthrough suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, and rocket \nlaunchings, which resulted in the death and injury of \nhundreds of individuals, including numerous American \ncitizens.\n10. From September 2000 forward, support by the \nPalestinian public for HAMAS grew steadily.\n11. It won elections at Palestinian universities, trade \nunions, and later in municipal elections.\n\nAppendix A\n7a\n12. For approximately the next four years after \nthe outbreak of the violent conflict, HAMAS launched \nhundreds of terrorist attacks targeting civilians that have \nresulted in the deaths and injury of hundreds of civilians, \nincluding numerous American citizens.\nTHE SHOOTING ATTACK ON ROUTE #60 \u2013 \nJUNE 20, 2003\n13. On June 20, 2003, Ahmad Najjar and Farah \nHamad, two HAMAS terrorists, perpetrated a shooting \nattack on Route #60 near the Yabroud underpass, killing \none person and seriously injuring three others.\nThe Goldstein Family\n14. Howard Goldstein was a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Israel when he died.\n15. He was murdered on June 20, 2003, while driving \nhis car with his parents on Route #60 in Israel.\n16. Howard was driving his parents and his wife from \nEli to Jerusalem where they had stayed the previous night \nfollowing the wedding of Howard\u2019s son, plaintiff David \nGoldstein. Howard and his wife and parents were traveling \nfor a weekend in Jerusalem to further celebrate David\u2019s \nwedding (which had taken place the previous night).\n17. While Howard was driving, Howard\u2019s father, \nplaintiff Eugene Goldstein, was seated in the front \npassenger seat and Howard\u2019s mother, plaintiff Lorraine \n\nAppendix A\n8a\nGoldstein, was seated behind her husband. Howard\u2019s wife, \nplaintiff Michal Goldstein (now Michal Honickman), was \nseated in the rear seat of the car, on the driver\u2019s side, \nbehind Howard.\n18. At some point, as Howard was driving, Eugene \nnoticed two individuals on the side of the road near the \nYabroud underpass. As the Goldsteins\u2019 car approached, \nthe men turned and began rapidly firing their guns at the \nGoldsteins\u2019 vehicle.\n19. Howard was struck by at least one bullet and \nultimately succumbed to his injuries while driving and \nslumped over the steering wheel.\n20. At some point in time, while Howard was slumped \nover the steering wheel, Eugene grabbed the steering \nwheel and maintained control of the car until it crashed \nand rolled over, approximately eight miles south of where \nthe HAMAS gunmen had opened fire.\n21. Plaintiff Michal Honickman, formerly known as \nMindy Goldstein, is a citizen of the United States and \na resident of the State of Nevada. She is the widow of \nHoward Goldstein.\n22. Plaintiff Michal Honickman brings this action both \nindividually and as the legal representative of the Estate \nof Howard Goldstein.\n23. As a result of the attack, Michal was injured when \nglass fragments from the vehicle\u2019s windows struck her \n\nAppendix A\n9a\nbody, including her left eye. She also sustained hairline \nfractures of her ribs, bruising, and physical trauma when \nthe vehicle eventually crashed and rolled over.\n24. Michal has sustained severe physical injuries \nand experienced severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress having been present during the attack, \nand witnessed the death of her husband, whom she had to \nbury and mourn with her children, while her in-laws were \nhospitalized, all in the context of what had been, prior to \nthat point, a joyous family occasion celebrating her son \nDavid\u2019s wedding.\n25. As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff Michal \nHonickman experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss \nof her husband\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\n26. Plaintiff Eugene Goldstein is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Florida. He is the \nfather of Howard Goldstein.\n27. Plaintiff Lorraine Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of Florida. She \nis the mother of Howard Goldstein.\n28. Eugene suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the \nattack.\n29. His shoulder blade was fractured, and his lungs \nwere punctured. Shrapnel was lodged in his lung, liver \n\nAppendix A\n10a\nand kidneys. A bullet remains stuck between his heart \nand his lungs.\n30. These injuries, which caused Eugene immense \npain, were life threatening. Indeed, it was highly \nimprobable that Eugene would survive them.\n31. Eugene\u2019s injuries necessitated insertion of a trocar, \na metal cylinder used to drain blood from his chest and \nfacilitate insertion of a chest tube to maintain suction and \npermit healing of the lung. Insertions of a trocar and chest \ntube are extremely painful.\n32. Eugene was unable to see Lorraine for \napproximately five days after the attack and did not have \nspecific information about her condition. His uncertainty \nabout Lorraine\u2019s condition caused him immense anxiety.\n33. As a result of the attack, Eugene still has several \nbullet fragments lodged in his chest. He must undergo \nan x-ray every three months to monitor their condition.\n34. As a result of the attack, Eugene has difficulty \nfalling and remaining asleep. He constantly replays the \nimage of the attack in his mind.\n35. He blames himself for taking his wife to attend \nhis grandson\u2019s wedding.\n36. Lorraine was shot multiple times and severely \ninjured in the attack.\n\nAppendix A\n11a\n37. She suffered a bullet fragment injury from a bullet \nthat clipped the tip of her nose and her left upper lip and \nlodged in her mouth. The fragment necessitated intubation \nand emergency surgery, during which the fragment was \nremoved from an area less than an inch from the carotid \nsheath, which contains the carotid artery and the internal \njugular vein. Disruption of either of them would have \nresulted in her death.\n38. At one point during her hospital stay, Lorraine \nwas placed on life support.\n39. Lorraine\u2019s chewing muscles were severely and \npermanently damaged, and she could not eat solid food \nfor approximately one year.\n40.

Tzvi obtained a second opinion \nfrom another doctor who agreed with the diagnosis.\n116. After a number of examinations by the initial \nphysician, and after treatment with antibiotics, Tzvi \nunderwent surgery on his left ear. After the surgery, the \nincessant ringing in his ears became louder and worse \nthan before.\n117. Tzvi also visited another physician for treatment \nof the severe pain in his hand. He was told the injuries \nmight require surgery.\n\nAppendix A\n23a\n118.

Three of Yitzhak\u2019s fellow soldiers were killed as \nthey (and Yitzhak) unsuccessfully attempted to stop al-\nBustami before he detonated his explosives.\n496. Yitzhak suffered shrapnel injuries to his leg and \nwas taken to Meir Hospital.\n\nAppendix A\n81a\n497. The emotional effects of the attack continue to \naffect Yitzhak to the present day.\n498. As a result of the attack, plaintiff Yitzhak Zahavy \nhas sustained physical injuries and experienced severe \nmental anguish and extreme emotional distress.\n499. Plaintiff Julie Zahavy is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Israel. She is the wife \nof plaintiff Yitzhak Zahavy.\n500.

As a result of the attack, plaintiffs Tzvee Zahavy \nand Bernice Zahavy have experienced severe mental \nanguish and extreme emotional distress.\nB. \t The Defendant\n504. Defendant BLOM BANK is a banking corporation \norganized under the laws of Lebanon and headquartered \nin Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nAppendix A\n82a\n505. BLOM BANK was established in 1951 as Banque \ndu Liban et D\u2019Outre Mer. In 2000, it changed its name \nto BLOM BANK. By 2016, BLOM BANK was Lebanon\u2019s \nlargest bank by market capitalization, with revenue of \n$2.35 billion and total assets of $29.52 billion. It has over \n4,000 employees.\n506. In 1962, Dr. Naaman Azhari was appointed \nas General Manager of BLOM BANK S.A.L. In 1971, \nDr. Azhari was appointed as Chairman of the bank. Dr. \nAzhari occupied the two positions until 2007, when he was \nappointed as Chairman of BLOM BANK Group. His son, \nSaad Azhari, has subsequently served as Chairman of \nthe Board and General Manager of BLOM BANK. Saad \nAzhari also serves as the Vice-President of the Association \nof Banks in Lebanon (\u201cABL\u201d), a cooperative association \nof approximately 65 banks in Lebanon.2\n507. During the relevant period (1998-2004), BLOM \nBANK conducted business in the United States and in \nNew York through correspondent bank accounts at Bank \nof New York, Citibank and American Express Bank.\n2.\u2002 The association includes, inter alia, Bank Saderat and \nal-Bilad Islamic Bank, both of which were designated SDGTs \nby the U.S. Treasury Department. Although Bank Saderat was \ndesignated in 2007, its membership in ABL was not suspended \nuntil 2014.\n\nAppendix A\n83a\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nI. \t THE ISLAMIC RESISTANCE MOVEMENT \n(HAMAS)\nA. \t HAMAS\u2019s Founding\n508. Several prominent terrorist organizations \noperate in Palestinian-controlled territory, most notably \nthe Islamic Resistance Movement (\u201cHAMAS\u201d), a \nradical Islamist terrorist organization committed to the \nglobalization of Islam through violent \u201cjihad\u201d (holy war).\n509. HAMAS3 was established in the Gaza Strip on \nDecember 10, 1987, shortly following the outbreak of the \nFirst Intifada.4 HAMAS announced its founding in an \n\u201cofficial\u201d communique on December 14, 1987.\n510. It represented the culmination of approximately \n15 years of preparation and organization building, led \nby Ahmed Yassin (also known as \u201cSheikh Yassin\u201d), the \nunrivaled leader of what had been the Muslim Brotherhood \nMovement in the Gaza Strip.5\n3.\u2002 HAMAS is an acronym of the Arabic \u201cHarakat al-\nMuqawama al-Islamiya\u201d \u2013 Islamic Resistance Movement \u2013 but its \nname also means, in Arabic, enthusiasm, courage, zeal for battle.\n4.\u2002 The term \u201cFirst Intifada,\u201d as used herein, relates to the \nviolent conflict that broke out in December 1987 between the \nPalestinians and Israel.\n5.\u2002 The Muslim Brotherhood Movement was established in \nEgypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, and was dedicated to the goal \nof fighting Western influences on Muslim society; ensuring the \n\nAppendix A\n84a\n511. Although Yassin had been confined to a wheelchair \nthroughout his adult life, he worked unceasingly for the \nestablishment of HAMAS in the Gaza Strip. When \nHAMAS was established in Yassin\u2019s home in 1987, the \nIslamic Resistance Movement already had a defined \nideology and a group of pre-existing institutions in Gaza, \nsuch as Al-Mujama Al-Islami (the Islamic Center) founded \nin 1973, Al-Jam\u2019iya Al-Islamiya (the Islamic Society) \nfounded in 1976, and the Islamic University of Gaza, that \nwere the flagship institutions of the Brotherhood\u2019s civilian \nsocial framework \u2013 the da\u2019wa.6\n512. On December 10, 1987, after violence broke out in \nthe Jabalia Refugee Camp, Sheikh Yassin invited six of the \nleaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza to his home.\n513. There the group decided on the establishment \nof HAMAS, an organization that would combine terror \nagainst Israel with the da\u2019wa (social welfare activities), \nthrough organizations such as Al-Mujama Al-Islami \nand Al-Jam\u2019iya Al-Islamiya. The seven participants of \nthat group are considered by HAMAS to be its founding \nfathers.\nadherence of Muslims to Islamic law (Shari\u2019a); and following the \nrectification of Muslim society, to eventually establish an Islamic \nstate that would expand its rule over the world by means of jihad \nand a call to join Islam. \n6.\u2002 The word \u201cda\u2019wa,\u201d whose basic meaning in Arabic is \u201cthe \ncall to the believers to shelter beneath the faith \u2013 return to the \nfaith,\u201d is used herein to refer to \u201cthe civilian infrastructure of \nHamas.\u201d\n\nAppendix A\n85a\n514. In an interview reported in the Filisteen al-\nMuslima newspaper in January 1998, Dr. Ibrahim al-\nYazuri, one of the original founding fathers of HAMAS, \noffered a telling description of HAMAS\u2019s philosophy \nregarding charitable giving:\nEveryone knows that the Islamic Resistance \nMovement, HAMAS, is a Palestinian Jihad \nmovement that strives for the liberation of all \nPalestine, from the (Mediterranean) sea to the \nriver (Jordan), from the north to the south, from \nthe tyrannical Israeli occupation, and this is the \nmain part of its concern. Social work is carried \nout in support of this aim, and it is considered \nto be part of the HAMAS movement\u2019s strategy \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. The HAMAS movement is concerned about \nits individuals and its elements, especially \nthose who engage in the blessed jihad against \nthe hateful Israeli occupation, since they are \nsubjected to detention or martyrdom. The \nmovement takes care of their families and \ntheir children and provides them with as much \nmaterial and moral support as it can. This is \none of the fundamental truths of Islamic work \nand thus represents the duties of the Islamic \nstate .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . The movement provides this aid \nthrough the support and assistance it gives to \nthe zakat (Islamic alms-giving) committees and \nthe Islamic associations and institutions in the \nGaza Strip.\n\nAppendix A\n86a\nB. \t HAMAS Rejected the Oslo Accords\n515. In December 1992, as a result of increased \nterrorist activity perpetrated by HAMAS, the government \nof Israel decided to deport over 350 HAMAS operatives \nto Marj al- Zuhur in Lebanon. The location became a \ntraining camp for the operatives, and an incubator of \nradicalism. This later became known as the \u201cMarj al-\nZuhur Deportation.\u201d\n516. The Marj al-Zuhur Deportation was a formative \nmoment in the history of HAMAS, assigning it almost \nmythical status. It established HAMAS\u2019s status as a \nleading Palestinian political organization and brought \nit to prominence in the Arab and international arenas. \nHAMAS members who were deported to Marj al-Zuhur \nhave a special place in the movement\u2019s history, and quickly \nbecame the most iconic members of HAMAS and the \nleadership of the HAMAS da\u2019wa.\n517. The international community condemned the \ndeportations, and at the end of 1993, the Israeli Supreme \nCourt ultimately determined that the Government of \nIsrael was compelled to accept the return of the Marj \nal-Zuhur deportees.\n518. On September 13, 1993, President Clinton hosted \nthe signing ceremony in Washington, D.C. for the so-\ncalled \u201cOslo Accords\u201d presented by Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (\u201cPLO\u201d) Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli \nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his foreign minister, \nShimon Peres.\n\nAppendix A\n87a\n519. The Oslo Accords had several significant aspects, \nincluding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of the \nWest Bank and Gaza, and the creation of the Palestinian \nNational Authority (\u201cPA\u201d), headed by Arafat. Under \nthe agreement, the newly-formed PA would perform \nthe services previously provided by Israel, including \neducation, health, social welfare, taxation and tourism.\n520. The agreement also included Letters of Mutual \nRecognition, whereby the Israeli government recognized \nthe PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian \npeople, while the PLO recognized Israel\u2019s existence and \npurportedly renounced terrorism, violence, and the desire \nfor the destruction of Israel.\n521. The Oslo Accords were not, however, universally \naccepted by the Palestinian factions. HAMAS, which \nhistorically did not accept the secular PLO as the sole \nofficial representative of the Palestinian people, rejected \nthe agreement for its recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist. \nThe Oslo Accords contradicted HAMAS\u2019s most valued \ntenet \u2013 the destruction of the State of Israel and the \ncreation of an Islamic state in its place.\n522. Accordingly, HAMAS pursued a three-pronged \nstrategy in the early 1990s.\n523. First, it upgraded its terror apparatus by \nperfecting its bomb-making skills and improving the \ncapabilities of its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam \nBrigades (herein, the \u201cQassam Brigades\u201d).\n\nAppendix A\n88a\n524. Second, it intensified its efforts to systematically \ngain control of pre-existing zakat7 committees and other \nreligious and social institutions that would ultimately \ncompete with the PA for the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the \nPalestinian public in Gaza, the West Bank and even the \nPalestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.\n525. Third, it accelerated the development of its world-\nwide fundraising network. While HAMAS enjoyed support \nfrom wealthy patrons in the Persian Gulf even in its prior \nincarnation as Sheikh Yassin\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood \nbranch in Gaza, the Oslo Accords galvanized its supporters \nin Europe, Africa and even the United States.\n526. Sanabil Association for Relief and Development, \nSubul al-Khair and the Islamic Welfare Association \n(Lebanon) were all da\u2019wa institutions in Lebanon \ntasked by HAMAS to extend HAMAS\u2019s reach into the \nPalestinian refugee camps where the organization was \ncompeting both with its long-time Palestinian nemesis, \nFatah, and the growing power and appeal of Hezbollah.\n527. HAMAS fundraisers and other operatives located \nabroad are key members of the HAMAS da\u2019wa, closely \ntied to da\u2019wa and Qassam Brigades operatives on the \nground in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as \nto HAMAS political leaders in Lebanon, Turkey, Qatar \nand elsewhere in the Middle East.\n7.\u2002 Zakat is a form of alms-giving treated in Islam as a \nreligious obligation, second in importance to prayer.\n\nAppendix A\n89a\n528. HAMAS\u2019s fundraising activities became the \nsubject of public knowledge not long after it was formed. \nIn 1994, The New York Times reported:\nHAMAS funding of all its activities is estimated \nby the Israelis at about $30 million a year. It \ncomes from money collected by associations \noperating largely abroad but with ties to the \ninternational Muslim Brotherhood network. \nMoney is also collected from Islamic and \nArab communities in the United States and in \nBritain, the Netherlands and other Western \nEuropean locations.\n529. Similarly, in 1996, The New York Times reported:\nIsraeli, Palestinian and Western intelligence \nofficials say Jordan is a major conduit for much \nof the HAMAS budget, estimated at $70 million \na year, nearly all of it for the social service \nnetwork of mosques, hospitals, schools and \nother institutions that form the movement\u2019s \npolitical base in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n .\u00a0.\u00a0. Jordan, intelligence officials say, is a major \npath through which money reaches the HAMAS \nnetwork of mosques and charities. Jordanian \nintelligence reports indicate that much of \nthe money is coming from the Persian Gulf \nemirates and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAppendix A\n90a\n530. A Washington Post article in 2001 reported that, \n\u201c[a]ccording to [Sheikh] Yassin, [HAMAS] distributes $2 \nmillion to $3 million in monthly handouts to the relatives \nof Palestinian suicide bombers; \u2018martyrs\u2019 who have been \nkilled by Israelis; and prisoners in Israeli jails.\u201d\n531. During this time, emboldened by increased \nsupport and intensified zeal, HAMAS broadened its \noperations from kidnapping and executing people \nsuspected of cooperating with Israel to murdering \ncivilians in Israel. In 1994 alone, HAMAS carried out \nthree separate suicide bombings of buses in Israel, killing \n35 people.\nC. \t The U.S. Government Designated Hamas\n532. On January 23, 1995, President Clinton issued \nExecutive Order No. 12947 designating HAMAS as a \n\u201cSpecially Designated Terrorist\u201d (\u201cSDT\u201d). President \nClinton found that \u201cgrave acts of violence committed by \nforeign terrorists that threaten to disrupt the Middle East \npeace process constitute an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy \nof the United States.\u201d\n533. Executive Order No. 12947 blocks all property \nand interests in property of the terrorist organizations \nand persons designated in the Order, including HAMAS. \nThis designation made it illegal for any United States \nperson or entity to engage in any unlicensed transactions \nor dealings involving the property or interests of HAMAS. \nHAMAS\u2019s designation as an SDT organization has \nremained in place since January 24, 1995.\n\nAppendix A\n91a\n534. HAMAS continued its terrorist activities, \nbombing a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. \nHAMAS claimed responsibility for the bombing, which \nkilled 26 people and injured 80. Six of the victims were \nU.S. citizens. That year, under heavy pressure from Israel \nand the PLO under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, the \nrecently-established Palestinian Authority very publicly \ntook steps against HAMAS as a result of a wave of \nHAMAS terrorist attacks. Over the coming years, the \nPA would, from time to time, attempt to take measures \nagainst the zakat committees and charitable societies run \nby HAMAS. Closures and arrests, however, were always \ntemporary.\n535. On October 8, 1997, by publication in the Federal \nRegister, the United States Secretary of State designated \nHAMAS as a Foreign Terrorist Organization pursuant to \nSection 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and \nthe AEDPA. As a result of this designation, it became \nillegal for any person within the United States or subject \nto its jurisdiction to provide material support or resources \nto HAMAS.\n536. The designation of HAMAS as an FTO has been \nrenewed every two years since 1997.\n537. On October 31, 2001, after the September 11, \n2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, President \nBush issued Executive Order No. 13224, declaring a \nnational emergency with respect to the \u201cgrave acts of \nterrorism .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the continuing and immediate threat of \nfurther attacks on United States nationals or the United \n\nAppendix A\n92a\nStates.\u201d Executive Order No. 13224 designated HAMAS \nas a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d). \nExecutive Order No. 13224 blocked all property and \ninterests in property of the SDGTs, including HAMAS. \nHAMAS\u2019s designation as an SDGT organization has \nremained in place since October 31, 2001.\nD. \t HAMAS\u2019s European Fundraising Network\n538. Comit\u00e9 de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux \nPalestiniens (\u201cCBSP\u201d), HAMAS\u2019s primary fundraiser \nin France, was founded in 1990 and registered there as a \nnon-profit organization.\n539. The Israeli government declared CBSP an illegal \norganization on May 6, 1997 because of its affiliation with \nHAMAS and the support it gave to HAMAS-affiliated \ninstitutions, and subsequently designated it a terrorist \norganization on January 17, 1998.\n540. Interpal, HAMAS\u2019s most important fundraising \norganization in the United Kingdom, was formally \nregistered as a charity with the U.K. Charity Commission \non August 11, 1994 under the name \u201cPalestinian Relief \nand Development Fund.\u201d\n541. As early as 1995, published reports in Israel \nlinked Interpal to HAMAS.\n542. The Israeli government declared Interpal an \nillegal organization on May 6, 1997 because of its affiliation \nwith HAMAS and the support it gave to HAMAS-\n\nAppendix A\n93a\naffiliated institutions and subsequently declared it a \nterrorist organization on January 17, 1998.\n543. On August 22, 2003, following the deadly suicide \nbombing aboard Bus #2 in Jerusalem on August 19, \n2003 in which Tehilla Nathansen was killed and multiple \nmembers of her family severely injured, the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment designated five HAMAS-related institutions \nand six senior HAMAS leaders as SDGTs.\n544. The five HAMAS-related charities that were \ndesignated as SDGTs were:\n1. \t Comit\u00e9 de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux \nPalestiniens (\u201cCBSP\u201d), of France.\n2. \t Association de Secours Palestinien (\u201cASP\u201d), \nof Switzerland (an organization affiliated \nwith CBSP).\n3. \t Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, \nor Interpal, headquartered in the United \nKingdom.\n4. \t Palestinian Association in Austria (\u201cPVOE\u201d).\n5. \t Sanabil Association for Relief and \nDevelopment based in Lebanon.\n545. The U.S. Treasury Press Release announcing \nthe designations of these five entities stated:\n\nAppendix A\n94a\nThe United States government has credible \nevidence that the following five organizations \nare part of a web of charities raising funds on \nbehalf of HAMAS and using humanitarians \n[sic] purposes as a cover for acts that support \nHAMAS. Funds are generated by, and flow \nthrough, these organizations on behalf of \nHAMAS.\n546. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, \n\u201cInterpal, headquartered in the UK, has been a principal \ncharity utilized to hide the flow of money to HAMAS. \nReporting indicates it is the conduit through which money \nflows to HAMAS from other charities, e.g., the Al Aqsa \nFoundation (designated under EO 13224 on May 29th) and \noversees the activities of other charities. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Reporting \nindicates that Interpal is the fundraising coordinator of \nHAMAS. This role is of the type that includes supervising \nactivities of charities, developing new charities in targeted \nareas, instructing how funds should be transferred from \none charity to another, and even determining public \nrelations policy.\u201d\n547. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, \n\u201cCBSP and ASP are primary fundraisers for HAMAS in \nFrance and Switzerland, respectively. Founded in France \nin the late 80s/early 90s, CBSP acts in collaboration with \nmore than a dozen humanitarian organizations based \nin different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in \nPalestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. ASP, \na subsidiary of CBSP, was founded in Switzerland in 1994. \nThe group has collected large amounts of money from \n\nAppendix A\n95a\nmosques and Islamic centers, which it then transfers \nto sub-organizations of HAMAS. Khalid Al-Shuli is the \npresident of CBSP and ASP.\u201d\n548. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, \n\u201cPVOE is controlled by the leader of HAMAS in Austria. \nThe money is targeted to support members of HAMAS \nand is funneled through other charities in Lebanon, the \nWest Bank and Gaza or other areas of the Middle East \nin order to ensure the transfer of funds is undetected \nand reaches its intended recipients. PVOE is part of the \nHAMAS network of charitable organizations that includes \nthe Al Aqsa Foundation.\u201d\n549. The Al-Aqsa Foundation, one of HAMAS\u2019s \nleading fundraising organizations, had branch offices \nin Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Yemen, South \nAfrica, and Pakistan. It was founded in July 1991 in \nGermany (Al-Aqsa e.V.), where it was headquartered, \nand which served as its main branch until at least 2002.\n550. On May 6, 1997, Israel outlawed the Al-Aqsa \nFoundation (including its German headquarters). \nOn January 19, 1998, Israel declared it a terrorist \norganization.\n551. In July 2002, the German government closed the \noffices of the Al-Aqsa Foundation located in Germany.\n552. According to the closure order, \u201cAL-AQSA e.V. \nadvocates, supports and calls for violence as means to \nachieve political, religious or other goals by awakening \n\nAppendix A\n96a\nor at least strengthening the willingness of third parties \nto use violence as a political, religious or other means.\u201d\n553. On May 29, 2003, the U.S. Treasury Department \ndesignated all branches of the Al- Aqsa Foundation as an \nSDGT pursuant to Executive Order 13224.\n554. The U.S. Treasury Press Release announcing \nAl-Aqsa\u2019s designation stated:\nAl Aqsa is a critical part of HAMAS\u2019 \nterrorist support infrastructure. Through its \nheadquarters in Germany and branch offices in \nthe Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, \nPakistan, South Africa, Yemen and elsewhere, \nAl Aqsa funnels money collected for charitable \npurposes to HAMAS terrorists.\nOther nations, including the Netherlands, \nGermany, Denmark, Britain, Luxembourg and \nSwitzerland, have also taken action against the \nAl-Aqsa Foundation.\nE. \t HAMAS in the United States \u2013 The Holy Land \nFoundation\n555. In October 1993, less than one month after \nthe public signing of the Oslo Accords, approximately \n20 members of the so-called \u201cPalestine Committee\u201d in \nthe United States gathered together in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania to discuss how to help HAMAS oppose the \nOslo Accords.\n\nAppendix A\n97a\n556. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) \nlearned of the Philadelphia meeting and obtained a \nwarrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nto monitor the meeting, which lasted approximately three \ndays.\n557. During the meeting, the participants discussed \nthe problems that the Oslo Accords presented for those \nopposed to co-existence with Israel, and attendees were \nadmonished not to mention \u201cHAMAS,\u201d but rather to refer \nto it as \u201cSamah,\u201d which is HAMAS spelled backwards.\n558. Attendees agreed that they must operate under \nan ostensible banner of apolitical humanitarian exercise \nin order to continue supporting HAMAS\u2019s vital social \nrecruitment effort by financially supporting institutions, \norganizations and programs in the West Bank and Gaza \naligned with HAMAS.\n559. Attendees identified several charitable societies \nand zakat committees as \u201cours.\u201d\n560. The Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF\u201d) emerged \nfrom the Philadelphia meeting as the preeminent HAMAS \nfundraising organization in the United States.\n561. However, neither the HLF nor the U.S.-based \nPalestinian Committee worked in isolation on behalf of \nHAMAS.\n562. While HLF was a vital member of HAMAS\u2019s \ninternational network of organizations dedicated to \n\nAppendix A\n98a\nfinancing HAMAS\u2019s agenda, it also worked in conjunction \nwith organizations in Europe and throughout the world \nto funnel money to the same closed network of HAMAS-\ncontrolled charitable societies and zakat committees in \nthe West Bank and Gaza.\n563. The HLF had offices in Texas, California, New \nJersey and Illinois, and quickly became the crown jewel in \nHAMAS\u2019s global fundraising network. HLF paid for Jamil \nHamami, HAMAS\u2019s leader in the West Bank, to take at \nleast 6 trips to the United States between September \n1990 and November 1991 so that he could appear as a \nguest speaker at HLF fundraising events. It also paid \nfor another HAMAS leader, Sheikh Mohammad Siam, \nto travel to the United States and appear at fundraisers. \nThese trips followed a decision by then HAMAS Political \nBureau head Mousa Abu Marzook to designate HLF as \nHAMAS\u2019s primary fund-raising entity in the United \nStates.\n564. Since 1995, when it first became illegal to \nprovide financial support to HAMAS, HLF provided \nover $12,400,000 in funding to HAMAS through various \nHAMAS-affiliated committees and organizations located \nin Palestinian-controlled areas and elsewhere. In the \nyear 2000 alone, HLF raised over $13 million. An FBI \ninvestigation \u201cdetermined that a majority of the funds \ncollected by the [HLF] are used to support HAMAS \nactivities in the Middle East.\u201d\n565. This is unsurprising given the close familial \nrelationships between HLF officers and known HAMAS \n\nAppendix A\n99a\nleaders in the Middle East. Shukri Abu Baker, the \nCEO of HLF, was the brother of HAMAS leader Jamal \nIssa. HLF\u2019s co-founder, Ghassan Elashi, was related by \nmarriage to Mousa Abu Marzook, while former HLF \nChairman Mohammed el-Mezain was Marzook\u2019s cousin. \nHLF member Mufid Abdelqader was a cousin of Khalid \nMishal, who would later become HAMAS\u2019s external \n(and supreme) leader. Both Mishal and Marzook were \ndesignated SDGTs by the Treasury Department in 2003. \nMarzook was also designated an SDT in 1995.\n566. According to a November 5, 2001 memorandum \nwritten by the Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s \nCounterterrorism Division, Dale Watson (the \u201c2001 FBI \nWatson Memo\u201d):\n[E]vidence strongly suggests that the [HLF] \nhas provided crucial financial support for \nfamilies of HAMAS suicide bombers, as well \nas the Palestinians who adhere to the HAMAS \nmovement. It is believed that by providing these \nannuities to families of HAMAS members, the \n[HLF] assists HAMAS by providing a constant \nflow of suicide volunteers and buttresses a \nterrorist infrastructure heavily reliant on \nmoral support of the Palestinian populace. \nAccording to [an informant], in the words \nof Shukri Abu Baker, [HLF\u2019s] mission is to \nsupport the families of the martyrs.\n567. The U.S. Treasury Department designated HLF \nas an SDGT on December 4, 2001. In 2004, HLF and \n\nAppendix A\n100a\nseveral of its directors were indicted on criminal charges \nthat HLF was illegally supporting HAMAS.\n568. In 2008, a jury found HLF and five of its former \ndirectors guilty of transferring more than $12 million to \nHAMAS.\n569. The convictions were affirmed in 2011 by the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\nF. \t HAMAS in Lebanon\n570. Although estimates vary, during the relevant \nperiod Palestinian refugees in Lebanon numbered \napproximately 300,000 and constituted the second-largest \nPalestinian diaspora community.\n571. Since its inception in 1982, Hezbollah has made \nsteady political inroads within this community.\n572. For example, Hezbollah has provided residents of \nthe Shatila refugee camp with potable water and supplies \ndiesel for the rundown power generators.\n573. However, as a fanatical Shi\u2019a organization, there \nare intrinsic limits on Hezbollah\u2019s ability to co-opt and \nspeak for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, who are \noverwhelmingly Sunni.\n574. In 1994, HAMAS established Sanabil Association \nfor Relief and Development, with the unofficial goal of \ncompeting with Hezbollah\u2019s social welfare infrastructure.\n\nAppendix A\n101a\n575. Immediately after Israel launched its \u201cGrapes \nof Wrath\u201d operation in southern Lebanon in 1996 to end \nrocket attacks on Northern Israel by Hezbollah, Sanabil \ndistributed more than $l00,000 to the inhabitants of the \nsouthern regions who had taken refuge in Sidon as part \nof its initial effort to compete with Hezbollah.\n576. In late 1999, the Syrian regime authorized \nHAMAS\u2019s political bureau in Damascus and Beirut, \nrepresented by Mousa Abu Marzook and Khalid Mishal, \nto take over the Lebanese Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s networks \nin the Palestinian refugee camps.\n577. This provided the Syrian regime a way to further \nexert control over HAMAS\u2019s leadership outside the \nPalestinian Territories and served as a means for the \nSyrian leadership to promote Islamists in Lebanon who \nwere primarily focused on attacking Israel rather than \nsettling internal scores within the fractured Palestinian \ncommunity.\n578. The emerging presence of HAMAS in the \nPalestinian refugee camps was widely publicized in the \nLebanese press, and for Syria, it provided a way to hamper \nthe progress of the even more radical (anti-Shi\u2019a and anti-\nSyrian) Salafist jihadist groups that were developing in \nLebanon.\n579. In the Palestinian refugee camps in southern \nLebanon, HAMAS and Palestinian Islamic Jihad compete \nwith secular parties for political hegemony and influence. \nTheir main opponent is the biggest PLO faction, Fatah.\n\nAppendix A\n102a\n580. Fatah is the largest, oldest and best organized of \nthe political movements and has offices and representatives \nin most camps in Lebanon, especially in the camps to the \nsouth. The organization was, at least during the 1990s, \nalso better funded and therefore able to underwrite social \nwelfare programs, which propelled HAMAS\u2019s need to \nobtain more funding than those of its political rivals.\n581. To secure the support of the Palestinian \ncommunity in Lebanon, HAMAS deliberately focused \nmost of their criticism on the PLO\u2019s leaders.\n582. HAMAS leaders in Lebanon publicly accused the \nPalestinian Authority of encouraging refugees to settle \npermanently in the country and give up their \u201cright of \nreturn\u201d to Palestine.\n583. In 1998, HAMAS helped create a \u201cPalestinian \nUlema League\u201d which was intended as an umbrella group \nfor Palestinian Islamic factions in Lebanon that wanted \nto challenge what they saw as the PLO\u2019s discredited \nleadership.\n584. Thus, during the Camp David peace negotiations \nof July 2000 that preceded the Second Intifada, the \nPalestinian Ulema League published fatwas (religious \nedicts) forbidding Palestinians to leave Lebanese territory \nif a regional settlement was reached that called for \nPalestinian refugees to emigrate to Europe or elsewhere.\n585. Thus, on a smaller scale than it operated in \nthe Palestinian Territories, HAMAS pursued the \n\nAppendix A\n103a\nsame tactics and goals in Lebanon, using a combination \nof propaganda, social welfare and cash grants and a \ncommitment to violence to energize and gain the loyalty \nof the Palestinians of Lebanon.\n586. For its part, Lebanon turned a blind eye to \nHAMAS\u2019s activities, including its substantial financial \nactivity in Lebanon.\n587. For example, senior HAMAS activist Jamal al-\nTawil, who was one of the Movement\u2019s most important \noperatives in the Ramallah area, was arrested by Israel \nin 2002 and later told his interrogators that he received \n$12,000 per month from HAMAS\u2019s leadership in Lebanon. \nOther notorious HAMAS operatives in the Palestinian \nTerritories ranging from Abbas al-Sayed (mastermind \nof the Park Hotel suicide bombing in Netanya) to Jamal \nMansur, one of HAMAS\u2019s senior operatives in Nablus to \nSheikh Ahmed Yassin himself, received funds transfers \nfrom representatives of HAMAS\u2019s bureau in Lebanon.\nII. \tBLOM BANK\u2019S HAMAS CUSTOMERS\nA. \t Sanabil Association for Relief and Development \n\u2013 HAMAS\u2019s Da\u2019wa Headquarters in Lebanon\n588. The Sanabil Association for Relief and \nDevelopment (\u201cSanabil\u201d), based in Sidon, Lebanon, was \nHAMAS\u2019s da\u2019wa headquarters in Lebanon until late 2003. \nBetween 1998 and 2001, it received millions of dollars in \nsupport from HAMAS\u2019s fundraising network, including \ndesignated organizations such as HLF, Interpal, CBSP \n\nAppendix A\n104a\nand the Al-Aqsa Foundation, and then channeled those \nfunds to the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to \nbuild HAMAS\u2019s support within that community.\n589. On August 23, 2003, the Lebanese newspaper \nAl-Saffir published a report stating that in August 2001, \nfollowing an order given by a HAMAS political leader \n(whose name was not mentioned), Sanabil opened offices in \nall of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in order \nto increase its activity.\n590. Sanabil was designated by the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment as an SDGT on August 22, 2003 for its \naffiliation with FTO HAMAS. According to the Treasury \nDepartment:\nThe Sanabil Association for Relief and \nDevelopment (Sanabil), based in Sidon, \nLebanon, receives large quantities of funds \nraised by major HAMAS-affiliated charities \nin Europe and the Middle East and, in turn, \nprovides funding to HAMAS. For example, \nSanabil has received funding from the Al Aqsa \nFoundation (designated as an SDGT under EO \n13224 in May 2003); the Holy Land Foundation \nfor Relief and Development (designated as an \nSDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001), and \nInterpal (designated as an SDGT under EO \n13224 as part of this tranche). HAMAS recruits \npermanent members from the religious and \nthe poor by extending charity to them from \norganizations such as Sanabil.\n\nAppendix A\n105a\nAt the request of a HAMAS political leader, \nSanabil began opening offices in all of the \nPalestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in August \nof 2001 in order to increase the foundation\u2019s role \ninside the camps. After starting by providing \nbasic necessities the charity eventually began \nasking poor families within the camps to fill \nout application forms, particularly those who \nhad worked with the Islamic Movement (Al-\nHaraka al-Islamiyya) and HAMAS. As a result \nof these efforts, Sanabil has increased its scope \nof influence within the camps.8\n591. Unsurprisingly, Sanabil\u2019s board members were \npredominantly well-known HAMAS leaders in Lebanon. \nFor example, HAMAS\u2019s current senior leader in Lebanon, \nAhmed Muhammad Abd al-Hadi, served on Sanabil\u2019s \nboard of trustees (over the years he was also HAMAS\u2019s \ndeputy representative and spokesman in Lebanon).\n592. Abdallah Atawat served as Sanabil\u2019s Deputy \nChairman of the Board of Trustees and as a board member \nof the Welfare Association for Palestinian and Lebanese \nFamilies (subsequently designated by the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment as an SDGT). Atawat is regarded as one of \nHAMAS\u2019s principal fundraisers in Lebanon.\n593. Id Yihya al-Mari was General Manager and \nSecretary of Sanabil\u2019s Board of Trustees. He also served as \n8.\u2002 \u201cU.S. Designates Five Charities Funding Hamas and Six \nSenior Hamas Leaders as Terrorist Entities,\u201d U.S. Department \nof the Treasury Press Release, August 22, 2003.\n\nAppendix A\n106a\ncoordinator of the Union of Good in Lebanon (subsequently \ndesignated by the U.S. Treasury Department as an \nSDGT), discussed below.\n594. Other members of the HAMAS leadership in \nLebanon who served as trustees of Sanabil included \nMashhur Abd al-Halim, who served as the Palestinian \nrelations representative of HAMAS in Lebanon, and Ziyad \nQamr, a HAMAS political official.\n595. During the relevant period (1999-2003) Sanabil \nheld account # 12-02-44037- 728529-1 at Defendant BLOM \nBANK in Sidon, Lebanon.\n596. To illustrate, between 1998 and 2001, HLF \ntransferred over $2 million U.S. dollars through BLOM \nBANK\u2019s correspondent bank accounts in New York to \nSanabil\u2019s bank account(s) at BLOM BANK in Lebanon.\n597. In 2000, HLF transferred over $1 million through \nBLOM BANK\u2019s correspondent bank accounts in New York \nto Sanabil\u2019s bank account(s) at BLOM BANK in Lebanon.\n598. In 2001, HLF transferred over $350,000 through \nBLOM BANK\u2019s correspondent bank accounts in New York \nto Sanabil\u2019s bank account(s) at BLOM BANK in Lebanon.\n599.

For example, on October 22, 1999, HLF \ntransferred $40,000 to Sanabil\u2019s account # 12-02-44037-\n728529-1 at Defendant BLOM BANK using BLOM \nBANK\u2019s correspondent account at Bank of New York. \nSee Exhibit A.\n601. On October 25, 2000, HLF transferred $20,000 to \nSanabil\u2019s account # 12-02- 44037-728529-1 at Defendant \nBLOM BANK using BLOM BANK\u2019s correspondent \naccount at Citibank. See Exhibit B.\n602. On October 19, 2000, HLF transferred $31,254 to \nSanabil\u2019s account # 12-02- 44037-728529-1 at Defendant \nBLOM BANK using BLOM BANK\u2019s correspondent \naccount at Northern Trust International Banking and \nAmerican Express Bank in New York. See Exhibit C.\n\nAppendix A\n113a\n603. As described below, KindHearts succeeded \nto HLF\u2019s fundraising for HAMAS after HLF was \ndesignated in December 2001. KindHearts sent an \nadditional $250,000 to Sanabil\u2019s accounts between July \n2002 and July 2003. Even after HLF\u2019s designation and \nthe public outcry about its support for HAMAS, BLOM \nBANK continued to maintain Sanabil\u2019s account # 12-\n02-44037-728529-1 and process U.S. dollar-denominated \ntransfers for KindHearts into the same account into which \nit had deposited HLF\u2019s funds.\n604. The Al-Aqsa Foundation transferred at least \n$50,000 into Sanabil\u2019s accounts at\nDefendant BLOM BANK between April \u2013 May 2003, \nusing BLOM BANK\u2019s correspondent account at the Bank \nof New York. See Exhibit D.\n605. Significantly, the second Al-Aqsa Foundation \ntransfer in Exhibit D was sent to BLOM BANK even \nthough Al-Aqsa Foundation had been designated by the \nU.S. Treasury on May 23, 2003.\n606. Between 1999 and 2003, Defendant BLOM \nBANK also processed fund transfers though its New York \ncorrespondent banks for CBSP and Interpal in amounts \nestimated to exceed $1 million.\n607. During this time period Sanabil served as \nInterpal\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d representative in Lebanon.\n\nAppendix A\n114a\n608. The U.S. government identified Sanabil as an \nunindicted co-conspirator in the HLF prosecution, calling \nit a \u201cpart of the Global HAMAS financing mechanism.\u201d\n609. In 2003, following a ruling from the Lebanese \njudiciary, the Sanabil organization center in the town \nof Sidon closed. Its closure \u2013 attributed to its links to \nHAMAS \u2013 was reported in the Lebanese press.\n610. For example, an August 27, 2004 article in \nThe Daily Star in Lebanon reported that Sanabil \u201chad \nsponsored 1,200 Palestinian families and spent around \n$800,000 on orphans and $55,000 on needy patients[.]\u201d The \nsame article reported that \u201c[f]rom 1997-2000, Al-Sanabil\u2019s \nannual budget grew to $700,000, according to Al-Sanabil\u2019s \nformer officials.\u201d\n611. Records seized from HLF show that Sanabil \nregularly distributed small sums in cash from its accounts \nto hundreds (if not thousands) of individual dependents \nin the Palestinian refugee camps under the categories of \n\u201cOrphan Sponsorships,\u201d \u201cStudent Sponsorships,\u201d \u201cNeedy \nSponsorships\u201d and \u201cFamily Sponsorships.\u201d\n612. The beneficiaries were provided \u201cmembership \nID numbers\u201d and paid small amounts individually in a \nmanner of an old-style political machine, buying loyalty \nin periodic stipends of $40-50 per quarter.\n613. Defendant BLOM BANK therefore not only \nfacilitated large infusions of funds from prominent \nHAMAS fundraising organizations around the world; it \n\nAppendix A\n115a\nalso facilitated thousands of small cash disbursements \nthat helped HAMAS purchase support in its target areas.\n614. After Sanabil closed, a Non-Governmental \nOrganization called KindHearts began working secretly \nand independently in the camps in Lebanon, attempting to \nmaintain a public distance from HAMAS to avoid drawing \nattention to its affiliation with the terrorist organization. \nAccording to the U.S. Treasury Department:\nBetween July and December 2002, KindHearts \nsent more than $100,000 USD to the Lebanon-\nbased SDGT Sanabil, according to information \navailable to the U.S. Financial investigation \nrevealed that between February 2003 and July \n2003, KindHearts transferred over $150,000 \nUSD to Sanabil. KindHearts deposited the \nfunds into the same account used by HLF when \nit was providing funds to the HAMAS-affiliated \nSanabil, according to FBI analysis.\n615. Just as KindHearts stepped into the shoes of \nSanabil in Sidon when Sanabil closed in 2003, KindHearts \ntook over HLF\u2019s fundraising for HAMAS after HLF was \ndesignated in December 2001. KindHearts was founded in \nJanuary 2002 and incorporated as a non-profit in Toledo, \nOhio. Mohammed El-Mezain, HAMAS\u2019s leader in the \nUnited States, was brought in as a fundraising specialist. \nEl-Mezain had previously worked as a fundraiser for HLF.\n616. Omar Shahin was the Arizona representative of \nHLF and later of KindHearts.\n\nAppendix A\n116a\n617. Once incorporated as a charitable organization, \nKindHearts quickly raised $2.9 million in 2002, $3.9 \nmillion in 2003, and $5 million in 2004. According to \nthe Treasury Department, during a September 2003 \nfundraising event, Osama Hamdan, HAMAS leader in \nLebanon at the time, called a KindHearts official to thank \nhim for KindHeart\u2019s support. During the fundraiser, one \nof the speakers urged support for HAMAS and Hezbollah.\n618. According to the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury, KindHearts sent $250,000 to Sanabil between \nJuly 2002 and July 2003.\n619. KindHeart\u2019s assets were frozen by the Treasury \nDepartment on February 19, 2006.\n620. KindHearts board chair Dr. Hatem Elhady told \nthe Toledo Blade, that \u201c[w]e did not just give money. We \ngave it for specific projects, and we saw the results, and \nwe have the receipts.\u201d\nB. \t Subul Al-Khair\n621. Subul al-Khair is a small HAMAS institution \nfounded in Beirut, Lebanon in 1998.\n622. Subul al-Khair was identified as an unindicted \nco-conspirator in HLF\u2019s criminal trial.\n623. Defendant BLOM BANK maintained an account \nfor Subul al-Khair at its Rawsheh branch in Beirut \n(Account No. 0227534) and deposited multiple transfers \nsent by HLF to Subul al-Khair.\n\nAppendix A\n117a\n624. Ostensibly, Subul al-Khair functioned much like \nSanabil, but was more focused on HAMAS supporters in \nthe Beirut area.\n625. Records seized from HLF show that HLF sent \nSubul al-Khair over $500,000 between 1999 and 2001.\n626. Subul al-Khair regularly distributed small sums \nin cash from its accounts to individual under the categories \nof \u201cOrphan Sponsorships\u201d and \u201cStudent Sponsorships.\u201d\n627. The beneficiaries were provided \u201cmembership \nID numbers\u201d and paid small amounts individually in a \nmanner of an old-style political machine, buying loyalty \nin periodic stipends of $30-40 per quarter.\n628. Defendant BLOM BANK therefore not only \nfacilitated large infusions of funds from prominent \nHAMAS fundraising organizations through Subul al-\nKhair; it also facilitated vast numbers of small cash \ndisbursements that helped HAMAS purchase support in \nits target areas.\nC. \t \u201cUnion Of Good\u201d\n629. The Union of Good (also known as the Charity \nCoalition or I\u2019tilaf Al-Khayr in Arabic) was established \nin October 2000, at the beginning of the Second Intifada, \nas the umbrella organization for HAMAS\u2019s global \nfundraising activity.\n630. Comprising more than 50 separate organizations \n\u2013 several of which have been designated SDGTs by the \n\nAppendix A\n118a\nU.S. Treasury Department, including Interpal and \nCBSP (two major HAMAS fundraising organizations in \nEurope) \u2013 the Union of Good originally began as a limited \n101-day fundraising drive for emergency aid at the outset \nof what was later called the Second Intifada, chaired by \nSheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s \nspiritual leader. According to Al-Qaradawi, \u201c[t]he martyr \noperations [sic] is the greatest of all sorts of Jihad in the \nCause of Allah.\u201d\n631. Sheikh al- Qaradawi issued a Muslim religious \nedict (fatwa) that gave HAMAS and other terrorist \ngroups religious approval authorizing suicide bombing \nattacks (including by women) against Israel.\n632. In a July 7, 2004 interview for BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight,\u201d \nal-Qaradawi, referring to the suicide attacks, said: \u201cI \nconsider this type of martyrdom operation as an evidence \nof God\u2019s justice.\u201d \n633. The 101-day fundraising drive was so successful \nthat the Union of Good was converted into a permanent \ninstitution. It quickly became the preeminent Muslim \nBrotherhood fundraising mechanism in the world, raising \ntens of millions of dollars for HAMAS.\n634. On February 25, 2002, the Union of Good was \ndesignated by Israel in an order of the Minister of Defense \nof the State of Israel, based on its being \u201cpart of the \nHamas organization or supporting it and strengthening \nits infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAppendix A\n119a\n635. The Union of Good was designated by the U.S. \nTreasury Department as an SDGT on November 12, 2008. \nAccording to the Treasury Department:\nUnion of Good acts as a broker for HAMAS by \nfacilitating financial transfers between a web \nof charitable organizations\u2014including several \norganizations previously designated under E.O. \n13224 for providing support to HAMAS\u2014and \nHAMAS-controlled organizations in the West \nBank and Gaza. The primary purpose of this \nactivity is to strengthen HAMAS\u2019 political and \nmilitary position in the West Bank and Gaza, \nincluding by: (i) diverting charitable donations \nto support HAMAS members and the families \nof terrorist operatives; and (ii) dispensing social \nwelfare and other charitable services on behalf \nof HAMAS.\nFunds raised by the Union of Good affiliates \nhave been transferred to HAMAS-managed \norganizations in the West Bank and Gaza. In \naddition to providing cover for HAMAS financial \ntransfers, some of the funds transferred by the \nUnion of Good have compensated HAMAS \nterrorists by providing payments to the families \nof suicide bombers. One of them, the Al-Salah \nSociety, previously identified as a key support \nnode for HAMAS, was designated in August \n2007 under E.O. 13224. The Society employed \na number of members of the HAMAS military \nwing and supported HAMAS- affiliated \ncombatants during the first Intifada.\n\nAppendix A\n120a\n636. Significantly, Al-Qaradawi is neither an obscure \nor shadowy figure. On the contrary, he had his own weekly \nlong-running television program on Al-Jazeera and has \nvery publicly issued an Islamic religious edict (fatwa) \nauthorizing suicide bombing attacks against Israel.\n637. In fact, on April 14, 2002, al-Qaradawi appeared \non Al-Jazeera extolling \u201cjihad and martyrdom\u201d against \nIsraelis and denouncing the U.S. designation of HAMAS \nand other terrorist organizations.\n638. HAMAS often relies on Al-Qaradawi\u2019s legal \nrulings in matters of current import and often turns to \nhim to obtain legal rulings, which are published from time \nto time in HAMAS\u2019s official newspapers (such as Filastin \nal-Muslima).\n639. HAMAS leaders have also served openly in \nthe Union of Good\u2019s executive leadership. For example, \nthe Secretary General of the Union of Good, Essam \nSalih Mustafa Yussuf, also acted as the Vice-Chairman \nof Interpal while serving on the HAMAS executive \ncommittee under then-HAMAS leader Khalid Mishal.\n640. The Union of Good maintained account no. 349647 \nat one of Defendant BLOM BANK\u2019s branches located on \nthe prestigious Verdun Street in Beirut.\n\nAppendix A\n121a\nCLAIM FOR RELIEF\nCIVIL LIABILITY UNDER 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d) FOR \nAIDING AND ABETTING HAMAS, A DEISGNATED \nFOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION\n641. Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation \nof the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.\n642. Plaintiffs were all injured by acts of international \nterrorism as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 2331 that were \ncommitted, planned and authorized by HAMAS, a \ndesignated FTO at the time each act of terrorism \ndescribed occurred.\n643. BLOM BANK provided substantial assistance \nto HAMAS by transferring significant sums of money \nto HAMAS and its operatives and maintaining bank \naccounts for its key institutions in Lebanon.\n644. BLOM BANK was fully aware of HAMAS\u2019s \nconduct, including its campaign of suicide bombings and \nother terrorist acts. \n491. BLOM BANK understood the value and \nimportance to HAMAS of its own role in facilitating large \ntransfers of funds, including the cross-border transfer of \nU.S. dollars, from donors and co-conspirators around the \nworld to Lebanon and making those funds easily available \nto HAMAS.\n\nAppendix A\n122a\n645. Plaintiffs allege that BLOM BANK knowingly \naided and abetted HAMAS within the meaning of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 2333(d) and within the legal framework of \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C.

BLOM Bank SAL, \nNo. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG\nDear Judge Matsumoto:\nPursuant to Section IV.B.1 of the Court\u2019s Chambers \nPractices and the Stipulation and Proposed Order entered \non February 8, 2019, I write to request a pre-motion \nconference to address a dispositive motion. The Complaint \n\nAppendix B\n143a\nin this civil action pleads a single aiding and abetting count \nagainst Defendant BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM\u201d) under the \ncivil liability provisions of the Antiterrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), \nas amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism \nAct (\u201cJASTA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a) & (d). Because the \nallegations against BLOM are facially inadequate, BLOM \nshould be permitted to move to dismiss the Complaint.\nBLOM is one of the oldest banks in Lebanon. Opened in \nBeirut in 1951, BLOM has no operations in the United \nStates. Its offices in 12 countries serve the niche market \nof Lebanese and Arab expatriates and business people \nin Europe and act as trusted local full-service banks \nin the Middle East. Plaintiffs allege that they (or their \nfamily members) were injured by a series of violent \nattacks committed in Israel by alleged agents of the \nIslamic Resistance Movement (\u201cHamas\u201d) in 2001\u20132003.1 \nPlaintiffs allege that BLOM provided routine banking \nservices to charitable organizations that, by Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown admission, engaged in actual charitable work. These \ncharities were later linked to Hamas.\n1.\u2002  Over the years, Plaintiffs have brought multiple lawsuits \nagainst other defendants allegedly responsible for their injuries. \nSee, e.g., Kirschenbaum, et al. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, No. \n03-cv-01708 (D.D.C.); Sokolow, et al. v. Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, et al., No. 04-cv-00397 (S.D.N.Y); Linde, et al., \nv. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 04-cv-2799 (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf, et al. v. \nCredit Lyonnais, S.A., No. 07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum, \net al. v. National Westminster Bank, PLC, No. 07-cv-00916 \n(E.D.N.Y.); Beer, et al. v. ASSA Corporation, No. 13-cv-01848 \n(S.D.N.Y.); Averbach, et al. v. Cairo Amman Bank, No. 19-cv- \n00004 (S.D.N.Y.); Spetner, et al. v. Palestine Investment Bank, \nNo. 19-cv-00005 (E.D.N.Y.); Singer, et al. v. Bank of Palestine, \nNo. 19-cv-00006 (E.D.N.Y.).\n\nAppendix B\n144a\nUnder the ATA\u2019s basic framework and the standards of \nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), Plaintiffs have not \nstated a claim. Nowhere in the Complaint do Plaintiffs \nallege sufficient facts to demonstrate that BLOM was \naware that it was playing any role in alleged terrorist \nactivities, that BLOM knowingly or substantially assisted \nthe acts that resulted in Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, or that BLOM\u2019s \nroutine banking services directly assisted the operatives \nwho caused those injuries. And, at the very least, a number \nof individual Plaintiffs should be dismissed because they \nlack standing or otherwise fail to plead a claim under the \nATA. The specific grounds for the proposed motion are \nas follows:\n1. Plaintiffs do not plead sufficient facts tending to \ndemonstrate that BLOM was aware it played any role \nin the alleged terrorist activities. Under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d \n314 (2d Cir. 2018), the mere provision of routine banking \nservices to a terrorist entity does not render a bank liable \nunder an aiding and abetting theory. Instead, \u201c[a]iding \nand abetting requires the secondary actor to be \u2018aware\u2019 \nthat, by assisting the principal, it is itself assuming a \u2018role\u2019 \nin terrorist activities.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329 (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). As \none recent decision in this District explained: \u201cEvidence \nthat Defendant knowingly provided banking services to \na terrorist organization, without more, is insufficient to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s scienter requirement.\u201d Weiss v. Nat\u2019l \nWestminster Bank PLC, No. 05-cv-4622-DLI-RML, 2019 \nWL 1441118, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2019)); see also \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 17-cv-8709-LTS-\n\nAppendix B\n145a\nGWG, 2019 WL 1409446, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2019) \n(dismissing for failure to state a claim where complaint \nfailed to allege facts showing that Defendants knew that \nfinancial services were \u201cdestined\u201d to aid organization \nresponsible for the attacks). Here, the Complaint alleges \nnothing more than that BLOM provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas. But none of the allegations, if true, \nwould establish that BLOM was aware of that connection \nat the time it provided those banking services or, more \nimportantly, that BLOM was aware that the banking \nservices it provided to those customers were connected \nto alleged terrorist activities. Even if BLOM did have \nreason to believe that its customers were in some way \naffiliated with Hamas, that awareness alone would not \nsubject BLOM to aiding and abetting liability because \nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the \nbank had any sense that its routine banking services might \nbe playing a role in terrorism.\n2. Plaintiffs do not plead sufficient facts tending \nto demonstrate that BLOM knowingly provided \nsubstantial assistance to the wrongful acts that caused \ntheir injuries. In addition to the requirement that an aider \nand abettor be generally aware that it is assuming a role \nin terrorist activities, JASTA requires that a defendant \n\u201cknowingly provid[e] substantial assistance [to] . . . \nthe person who committed such an act of international \nterrorism.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 320   (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)). Here, again, the Complaint is legally deficient: \nPlaintiffs do not plead that BLOM knowingly assisted \nthe alleged terrorist activities or that it assisted those \nactivities in a substantial fashion. The case law sets forth \n\nAppendix B\n146a\nsix factors relevant to determining whether an alleged \nact can satisfy the substantial assistance requirement \nof JASTA: \u201c(1) the nature of the act encouraged, (2) the \namount of assistance given by defendant, (3) defendant\u2019s \npresence or absence at the time of the tort, (4) defendant\u2019s \nrelation to the principal, (5) defendant\u2019s state of mind, and \n(6) the period of defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d \nat 330. These factors cut decisively against a finding of \nsubstantial assistance. The \u201cnature of the act\u201d at issue \nis the alleged provision of routine banking services to \norganizations that purported to be legitimate charities \n(and that did in fact do charitable work) before the U.S. \ngovernment designated them as Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists (\u201cSDGTs\u201d) and BLOM\u2019s subsequent \nclosing of their accounts. Plaintiffs make no effort even \nto try to quantify the \u201camount of assistance\u201d that BLOM \nis alleged to have provided, indirectly through charitable \norganizations, to the alleged terrorist activities. BLOM\u2019s \nalleged \u201crelation to\u201d the attacks was attenuated, at \nbest. BLOM is not alleged to have been present at \nany of the attacks. And Plaintiffs have not alleged any \nfacts suggesting that BLOM in any way encouraged or \nsupported alleged terrorism.\n3. Plaintiffs do not plead sufficient facts tending to \ndemonstrate that BLOM\u2019s routine banking services \ndirectly assisted the acts that caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. \nIn addition, under the plain text of the ATA, as amended \nby JASTA, a defendant is liable only if it directly aided \nand abetted the \u201cperson\u201d who committed the relevant \u201cact \nof international terrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2). But \nPlaintiffs do not allege that any BLOM account holder \ncommitted the attacks that caused their harms. Instead, \n\nAppendix B\n147a\nPlaintiffs have alleged that BLOM provided routine \nbanking services to charitable organizations that then \naided and abetted alleged terrorist activities. But JASTA \ndoes not impose liability for aiding and abetting an alleged \naider and abettor. Siegel v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., No. \n17-cv-6593-DLC, 2018 WL 3611967, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July \n27, 2018), appeal docketed No. 18-2540 (2d Cir. Aug. 27, \n2018). Moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations come nowhere close \nto establishing any causal relationship between BLOM\u2019s \nprovision of routine banking services and the attacks that \ncaused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\n4. Additionally and alternatively, certain individual \nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims require dismissal. A number of \nPlaintiffs are ineligible to sue under the ATA because \nthey are not \u201cnational[s] of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a); see Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 135, 260, 385, 458 (Plaintiffs are \nnationals of Israel and France). In addition, others have \nnot alleged injuries that were proximately caused by an act \nof terrorism or fairly traceable to BLOM\u2019s alleged actions, \nas required to establish a claim and Article III standing. \nSee Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 465\u201385 (describing injuries arising from \nslip-and-fall).\nWe will be prepared to address these issues at a pre-\nmotion conference. The parties have agreed to the \nfollowing briefing schedule: BLOM\u2019s moving papers to be \nserved on June 3, 2019; opposition papers to be served on \nJuly 8, 2019; and reply papers to be served on July 29, 2019.\nRespectfully,\n/s/ Linda C.

Matsumoto\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States District Court, Eastern District of New York\n225 Cadman Plaza East\nBrooklyn, New York 11201\nRe:\t\n, \nNo. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG\nDear Judge Matsumoto:\nPlaintiffs respectfully write in response to Defendant\u2019s \nMay 3, 2019 letter.\nThe Complaint alleges sufficient facts to satisfy 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a72333(d) as enacted by Congress through the \nJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), \n\nAppendix C\n149a\nwhich expressly found that Halberstam v. Welch, 705 \nF.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983) \u201cprovides the proper legal \nframework for how such liability should function in the \ncontext of Chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code.\u201d \nEighteen U.S.C. \u00a72333 (note), \u00a72(a)(5). The Court of \nAppeals followed this directive in Linde v. Arab Bank, \nPLC, 882 F.3d 314, 329 (2d Cir. 2018) (\u201cwe are mindful \nthat Congress, in enacting JASTA, instructed that the \n\u2018proper legal framework for how [aiding and abetting] \nliability should function\u2019 under the ATA is that identified \nin Halberstam\u201d).\nLinde then restated and applied Halberstam\u2019s \nelements (as Congress required):\n(1)\t the party whom the defendant aids must \nperform a wrongful act that causes an \ninjury;\n(2)\tthe defendant must be generally aware \nof his role as part of an overall illegal or \ntortious activity at the time he provides the \nassistance; and\n(3)\tthe defendant must knowingly and \nsubstantially assist the principal violation.\nId. (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487). Plaintiffs\u2019 \nallegations satisfy all three elements.\n\nAppendix C\n150a\nWrongful Act\nThe Complaint identifies the terrorist attacks HAMAS \ncommitted, planned and authorized that killed and injured \nPlaintiffs and their representatives. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b613, \n76, 207, 240, 299, 318, 337-39, 390, 407, 413-14, 486, 491.\nGeneral Awareness\nHalberstam held that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s conclusions \nthat Hamilton knew about and acted to support \nWelch\u2019s illicit enterprise [not the murder] establish \nthat Hamilton had a general awareness of her role in a \ncontinuing criminal enterprise. The second element is \nthus satisfied.\u201d 705 F.2d at 488 (emphasis added). Linde \ninterpreted Halberstam to require \u201caware[ness]\u201d that by \nassisting the principal, defendant was \u201cassuming a \u2018role\u2019 \nin terrorist activities.\u201d Id. at 329. It expressly rejected \nany requirement that this necessitates proof of specific \nintent \u201cto participate in a criminal scheme as \u2018something \nthat [defendant] wishes to bring about and seek by his \naction to make it succeed.\u2019\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Nor did \nLinde require awareness of the specific acts at issue. Id. \nIn fact, Halberstam held that plaintiff did not even have \nto prove that \u201cHamilton knew specifically that Welch \nwas committing burglaries,\u201d as long as she knew he \nwas involved \u201cin some type of personal property crime \nat night\u2014whether as a fence, burglar, or armed robber \nmade no difference\u2014because violence and killing is a \nforeseeable risk in any of these enterprises.\u201d 705 F.2d at \n488.\n\nAppendix C\n151a\nBLOM disregards this straightforward legal \nstandard, arguing that \u201c[e]ven if BLOM did have reason \nto believe that its customers were in some way affiliated \nwith Hamas, that awareness alone would not subject \nBLOM to aiding and abetting liability because Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged facts demonstrating that the bank had \nany sense that its  routine banking services might be \nplaying a role in terrorism.\u201d Letter at 2. The Complaint, \nhowever, specifies that senior HAMAS leader Ahmed \nMuhammad Abd al-Hadi served on the board of BLOM\u2019s \ncustomer, Sanabil Association for Relief and Development \n(\u201cSanabil\u201d) together with HAMAS\u2019s chief fundraiser in \nLebanon, Abdallah Atawat. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6591-592. Exhibit \nD to the Complaint even provides evidence of funds \ntransfers made by the HAMAS fundraising organization \nAl Aqsa Foundation to Sanabil\u2019s account at BLOM\u2014after \nAl Aqsa was designated a terrorist by the United States.\nSubstantial Assistance\nThe parties agree that the factors a court must \nconsider in determining whether a defendant has provided \n\u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to a primary tortfeasor (in this \ncase HAMAS) are:\n(1)\t the nature of the act encouraged;\n(2)\tthe amount of assistance given by defendant;\n(3)\tdefendant\u2019s presence or absence at the time \nof the tort;\n\nAppendix C\n152a\n(4)\t defendant\u2019s relation to the principal;\n(5)\tdefendant\u2019s state of mind; and\n(6)\tthe period of defendant\u2019s assistance.\nLinde at 329, 330. As set forth below, the Complaint \nplausibly alleges that BLOM provided substantial \nassistance to HAMAS.\nThe nature of the act encouraged. \u201c[T]he nature of \nthe act involved dictates what aid might matter, i.e., be \nsubstantial.\u201d Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 484. Halberstam \nfound that the \u201clong-running burglary enterprise [was] \nheavily dependent\u201d on laundering the goods, id. at 488, \nwhich was assisted by defendant Hamilton who served as \nher boyfriend\u2019s \u201cbanker, bookkeeper, recordkeeper, and \nsecretary,\u201d id. at 487. Moreover, \u201c[u]nder the \u2018nature of the \nact\u2019 criterion, a court might also apply a proportionality test \nto particularly bad or opprobrious acts, i.e., a defendant\u2019s \nresponsibility for the same amount of assistance increases \nwith the blameworthiness of the tortious act or the \nseriousness of the foreseeable consequences.\u201d Id., at 484 \nn.13. Thus, Halberstam found that \u201c[a]lthough Hamilton\u2019s \nown acts were neutral standing alone, they must be \nevaluated in the context of the enterprise they aided, i.e., a \nfive-year-long burglary campaign against private homes.\u201d \nId. at 488. Here, even assuming arguendo that Defendant\u2019s \nbanking activities were \u201cneutral standing alone,\u201d they \nmust be evaluated in the context of the \u201cblameworthiness\u201d \nof the horrific acts HAMAS perpetrated and the \n\u201cseriousness\u201d of the foreseeable consequences of providing \n\nAppendix C\n153a\nsubstantial, contemporaneous support to that terrorist \norganization.1\nThe amount of the assistance. \u201cThe amount [and \nkind] of assistance given the wrongdoer is also a significant \nfactor .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 484. Money is the \nlifeblood of terrorism, and as in Halberstam, \u201cintegral\u201d \nto its operation. Id.

Thus, in Halberstam, \u201calthough the \namount of assistance [chiefly money laundering and tax \npreparation] Hamilton gave Welch [her burglar boyfriend] \nmay not have been overwhelming as to any given burglary \nin the five-year life of this criminal operation, it added up \nover time to an essential part of the pattern.\u201d Id. at 488. \nHere, Defendant allegedly provided HAMAS significant \namounts of support continually for years in the midst of \nan ongoing terror campaign during the Second Intifada. \nSee, e.g., Complaint \u00b6599\u2014table listing payments from the \nHoly Land Foundation (convicted HAMAS fundraiser). \nSee also, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6600-606.\nPresence at the time of the tort. In Halberstam, \n\u201cHamilton was admittedly not present at the time of the \n1.\u2002 The Executive Branch has found, and the Supreme Court \nhas agreed, that \u201c\u2018[m]aterial support\u2019 is a valuable resource by \ndefinition.\u201d Holder, 561 U.S. 1, 30 (2010). \u201c[I]t is highly likely that \nany material support to these organizations will ultimately inure \nto the benefit of their criminal, terrorist functions\u2014regardless \nof whether such support was ostensibly intended to support non-\nviolent, non-terrorist activities.\u201d Id. at 33 (quoting government \naffidavit setting out the Executive Branch\u2019s view, to which the \nCourt deferred).\n\nAppendix C\n154a\nmurder or even at the time of any burglary,\u201d but \u201cthe success \nof the tortious enterprise clearly required expeditious and \nunsuspicious disposal of the goods, and Hamilton\u2019s role in \nthat side of the business was substantial.\u201d Id. at 488. Here, \nBLOM was also not \u201cpresent at the scene,\u201d but HAMAS\u2019s \nterror campaign required significant funding and the U.S. \nGovernment has determined that Defendant\u2019s (SDGT) \ncustomers played a significant role in fueling HAMAS, \nconduct BLOM facilitated. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6590, 635.\nRelationship to the principal. BLOM served as a \nwilling banker for two primary HAMAS fundraisers in \nLebanon, Sanabil and the Union of Good.2 By soliciting \nfunds for HAMAS, these organizations engaged in what \nare defined as \u201cterrorist activities\u201d by the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, incorporated into \u00a72339B(a)(1). The \nrelationship was intimate, because a banker must know \nand communicate with its customers, approve transfers \nin and out of customers\u2019 accounts, and apply regulatory \nrequirements to such transfers. The Complaint amply \nalleges the continuing nature of the relationship BLOM \nmaintained with these notorious HAMAS institutions.\nDefendant\u2019s state of mind. Halberstam emphasized \nthat Hamilton\u2019s assistance was knowing, long-term, and \ncontinuous, not some \u201cpassing fancy or impetuous act.\u201d \n705 F.2d at 488. BLOM\u2019s alleged assistance to Sanabil and \nthe Union of Good was likewise knowing, long-term, and \ncontinuous, reflecting its intentional, deliberate decision to \n2.\u2002 It also allegedly provided services to a third, less prominent \nHAMAS fundraiser, Subul al-Khair.\n\nAppendix C\n155a\nrender that assistance. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6596, 603, 621-28, 629-\n40. Halberstam also held that \u201c[t]he particularly offensive \nnature of an underlying offense might also factor in this \ncriterion. 705 F.2d at 484 n.13. Nothing is more offensive \nthan mass killings and maiming of innocent civilians, \nincluding children. \nDuration of assistance. Halberstam added this \n\u201cimportant\u201d factor to those delineated in the Restatement \n(Second) of Torts \u00a7876 (1979) because it \u201calmost certainly \naffects the quality and extent of their relationship and \nprobably influences the amount of aid provided as well; \nadditionally, it may afford evidence of the defendant\u2019s state \nof mind.\u201d Id. at 484. In Halberstam, this factor \u201cstrongly \ninfluenced [the court\u2019s] weighing of Hamilton\u2019s assistance. \nIt affected [the court\u2019s] sense of how Hamilton perceived \nher role and of the value of her assistance to Welch.\u201d Id. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that BLOM assisted HAMAS for \nyears, even after Sanabil was designated. BLOM\u2019s conduct \nwas continuous, extensive, and critical to the success of \nHAMAS\u2019s terror campaign.\nWe will be prepared to address the relevant issues at \nthe pre-motion conference.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/                                                   \nGary M.

The \nComplaint\u2019s elaborate descriptions of the alleged history \nof the Islamic Resistance Movement (\u201cHamas\u201d) and \nthe incidents that led to Plaintiffs\u2019 unfortunate injuries \nare most striking for what they do not say: anything \nconnecting BLOM to those incidents or to Hamas. The \nonly allegations against BLOM are that it maintained bank \naccounts for three charitable organizations, two of which \nwere later sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department \nafter all of the acts resulting in Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Only a \n\nAppendix F\n161a\nhandful of the Complaint\u2019s 645 paragraphs even mention \nBLOM.\nNowhere does the Complaint plead facts that would \nestablish that those charities were involved in any terrorist \nactivities, or that BLOM was aware of such involvement, \nlet alone that BLOM knowingly and substantially assisted \nthose persons who allegedly committed the terrorist acts. \nThat failure is fatal because Plaintiffs\u2019 sole claim against \nBLOM is for secondary liability, specifically aiding and \nabetting liability, under the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2). To \nsuccessfully plead such a claim, a plaintiff must plausibly \nallege facts showing that the defendant knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to the perpetrator of the \nrelevant act of terrorism and that, when doing so, the \ndefendant was generally aware that it was assuming a role \nin violent or life-threatening acts. Linde v. Arab Bank, \nPLC, 882 F.3d 314, 329\u201330 (2d Cir. 2018).\nThe allegations in the Complaint do not come close to \nmeeting that demanding standard. Ostensibly, Plaintiffs \nclaim that BLOM aided and abetted Hamas, without \nactually linking BLOM to Hamas or to any violent or \nlife-threatening activities. Plaintiffs try to forge that link \nby conflating the three charities that are alleged to have \nbeen BLOM\u2019s customers with Hamas and the terrorists \nwho committed the attacks at issue. But the facts alleged \nin the Complaint do not plausibly establish that the \ncharities that allegedly received banking services from \nBLOM were involved in violent activities, much less that \nBLOM was aware of such involvement and knowingly and \n\nAppendix F\n162a\nsubstantially assisted it. Because JASTA requires them to \nplead much more, the Court should dismiss the Complaint.\nBACKGROUND\nI. \t Statutory Background: Anti-terrorism Act and the \nJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\nPlaintiffs\u2019 sole claim for relief is an aiding and abetting \nclaim under the ATA. Congress originally enacted the \nATA in 1992 to hold terrorists accountable for their \nactions by providing a federal cause of action\u2014a \u201cprimary \nliability\u201d ATA claim\u2014to any U.S. national \u201cinjured in his \nor her person, property, or business by reason of an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(a). Congress \ncrafted the statute to require proof that the defendant \nengaged in \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d and that the \ndefendant\u2019s wrongful acts caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02331(1); Linde, 882 F.3d at 331; Rothstein \nv. UBS AG, 708 F.3d 82, 95 (2d Cir. 2013). The statute \ndefines an \u201cact of international terrorism\u201d to require, \namong other things, that the defendants acted in a way \nthat was \u201cdangerous to human life\u201d and with an objectively \nterroristic intent. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02331(1). The Complaint does \nnot assert a primary liability claim against BLOM.\nIn 2016, Congress enacted JASTA, which amends \nthe ATA to add secondary liability in the form of aiding \nand abetting and conspiracy claims.1 Secondary liability \n1.\u2002 The Complaint does not assert a conspiracy claim under \nJASTA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0641\u201345.\n\nAppendix F\n163a\nclaims under the ATA can be pled only through JASTA\u2019s \namendments and only under a narrow set of circumstances. \nSee Rothstein, 708 F.3d at 97 (concluding, prior to JASTA, \nthat the ATA did not include an aiding and abetting claim). \nThe relevant provision provides:\nIn an action under subsection (a) for an injury \narising from an act of international terrorism \ncommitted, planned, or authorized by an \norganization that had been designated as a \nforeign terrorist organization under section \n219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(8 U.S.C. 1189), as of the date on which such \nact of international terrorism was committed, \nplanned, or authorized, liability may be \nasserted as to any person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or \nwho conspires with the person who committed \nsuch an act of international terrorism.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2).\nThrough this language, Congress imposed three \nimportant limitations on aiding and abetting liability. \nFirst, unlike primary liability, secondary liability is \navailable only where the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused \nby an act of international terrorism that was \u201ccommitted, \nplanned, or authorized by an organization that has been \ndesignated as a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2). A \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d (\u201cForeign \nTerrorist Organization\u201d or \u201cFTO\u201d) is an organization that \nhas been formally designated by the Secretary of State \nupon finding, among other things, that the organization \n\nAppendix F\n164a\nengages in terrorism or \u201cretains the capability and intent \nto engage in terrorism.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01189(a)(1), (d)(4). That \ndesignation is different from other terrorism-related \ndesignations issued by the Treasury Department, other \nU.S. government agencies, and other countries.2\nSecond, JASTA requires that the defendant must \nhave \u201cknowingly provid[ed] substantial assistance\u201d to \n\u201cthe person who committed\u201d the \u201cact of international \nterrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2). In the context of a \nbank defendant such as BLOM, this means the allegations \nmust show the defendant \u201cwas \u2018generally aware\u2019 that \n[by providing financial services] it was thereby playing \na \u2018role\u2019 in [the terrorists\u2019] violent or life-endangering \nactivities.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329 (quoting Halberstam \nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. 1983)) (emphasis \nadded). This scienter requirement demands \u201cmore than \nthe provision of material support to a designated terrorist \norganization,\u201d because the criminal material support \nprovisions of the ATA have a different scienter standard, \n\u201cwhich requires only knowledge of an organization\u2019s \n2.\u2002 An entity\u2019s mere association with a Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization does not convert it into a Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization. In fact, numerous procedural steps accompany \nthe Foreign Terrorist Organization designation. The Secretary \nof State must notify certain congressional leaders prior to \ndesignation and publish the designation in the Federal Register. \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01189(a)(2). A designated entity has the opportunity to \nchallenge the designation following publication of the designation \nin the Federal Register. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01189(c)(1). Additionally, a \ndesignation can be amended or modified if the Secretary of State \nfinds that the FTO has merged with another organization. 8 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a01189(b)(1).\n\nAppendix F\n165a\nconnection to terrorism, not intent to further its terrorist \nactivities or awareness that one is playing a role in those \nactivities.\u201d Id. at 329\u201330 (referring to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02339B); \nsee also Strauss v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A, No. 06-cv-702 \n(DLI) (RML), 2019 WL 1492902, *11 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, \n2019), appeal filed, No. 19-1285 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2019) \n(denying request to add an ATA aiding and abetting claim \nas futile because the plaintiffs had satisfied the scienter \nrequirement for providing material support, but not the \nhigher scienter requirement of aiding and abetting).\nThird, because JASTA requires assistance to \u201cthe \nperson who committed\u201d the terrorist act, a defendant \ncannot be liable for aiding and abetting another putative \naider-and-abettor or for acts that only indirectly assisted \nthe perpetrator of an act of international terrorism. See \nSiegel v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., No. 17-cv-6593 (DLC), \n2018 WL 3611967, *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2018), appeal filed, \nNo. 17-2540 (2d Cir. December 7, 2018). This statutory \nprovision requires a direct connection between the \ndefendant and the person or FTO that committed the \nattack. Crosby v. Twitter, Inc., 921 F.3d 617, 626\u201327, n.6 \n(6th Cir. 2019); Siegel, 2018 WL 3611967 at *4.\nIn addition, as explained by the Second Circuit in \nLinde, JASTA states that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), should \nprovide the legal framework for aiding and abetting \nliability under \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2). See 882 F.3d at 329 (citing \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333 Statutory Note (Findings and Purpose \n\u00a7\u00a05)). Halberstam\u2019s aiding and abetting framework has \nthree elements: (1) \u201cthe party whom the defendant aids \n\nAppendix F\n166a\nmust perform a wrongful act that causes an injury,\u201d (2) \n\u201cthe defendant must be generally aware of his role as \npart of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the time \nthat he provides the assistance,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe defendant \nmust knowingly and substantially assist the principal \nviolation.\u201d 705 F.2d at 487\u201388. And six factors are relevant \nto determining \u201chow much encouragement or assistance is \nsubstantial enough\u201d to satisfy the third element: \u201c(1) the \nnature of the act encouraged, (2) the amount of assistance \ngiven by defendant, (3) defendant\u2019s presence or absence \nat the time of the tort, (4) defendant\u2019s relation to the \nprincipal, (5) defendant\u2019s state of mind, and (6) the period \nof defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329 (citing \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 483\u201384).\nThus, under JASTA\u2019s statutory text and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s precedents, Plaintiffs\u2019 aiding and abetting claim \ncan survive this Motion to Dismiss only if the Complaint \nplausibly alleges that BLOM was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d \nthat, by providing financial services to the three alleged \ncustomers, it was playing a direct \u201crole\u201d in a Foreign \nTerrorist Organization\u2019s violent or life-endangering \nactivities that caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, and that BLOM \nknowingly and substantially assisted the person who \ncommitted those terrorist activities. Linde, 882 F.3d at \n329.\nII. \tStatement of Facts\nPlaintiffs in this case are individuals and their family \nmembers who were injured by twelve violent attacks \nin Israel between 2001 and 2003 that allegedly were \n\nAppendix F\n167a\nperpetrated by individuals associated with Hamas. E.g., \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a03, 642. Listed chronologically, these attacks \nwere on Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem (Dec. 1, 2001), at \nthe Park Hotel in Netenaya (March 27, 2002), at Sheffield \nClub near Tel Aviv (May 7, 2002), on the Patt Junction Bus \n#32A in Jerusalem (June 18, 2002), at Hebrew University \nin Jerusalem (July 31, 2002), in Ariel, a town on the \nWest Bank (Oct. 27, 2002), on Route 60 in the West Bank \n(Jan. 29, 2003 and June 20, 2003), at Mike\u2019s Place in Tel \nAviv (April 30, 2003), on Commuter Bus #6 heading to \nJerusalem (May 18, 2003), in Jerusalem on Jaffa Road Bus \n#14A (June 11, 2003), and in Jerusalem on Egged Bus #2 \n(Aug. 19, 2003) (individually, an \u201cAttack\u201d or collectively, \n\u201cthe Attacks\u201d). Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a013, 76, 207, 240, 299, 318, 337, 390, \n407, 413, 486, 491.\nIn the more than fifteen years since the most recent \nof these Attacks, Plaintiffs have brought multiple \nlawsuits against other defendants allegedly responsible \nfor their injuries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization and numerous \nEuropean and Middle Eastern banks.3 Just hours before \n3.\u2002 See, e.g., Kirschenbaum, et al. v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, \nNo. 03-cv-01708 (D.D.C.); Sokolow, et al. v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., et al., No. 04-cv-00397 (S.D.N.Y); Linde, et al., v.

On the contrary, BLOM is \none of the oldest banks in Lebanon and has itself been \nthe target of a violent terrorist act.6 Opened in Beirut in \n1951, BLOM is actively present in 12 countries, serving \nthe niche market of Lebanese and Arab expatriates \nand business people in Europe, but has no operations in \nthe United States or in Israel, where all of the alleged \nAttacks occurred.7 Plaintiffs do not allege BLOM \n4.\u2002 A savings clause in the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2013 extended the ordinary ten-year statute \nof limitations to January 2, 2019.

Instead, Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is \nthat BLOM provided routine banking services to three \ncharitable organizations that allegedly supported Hamas\u2019s \nnon-violent activities in Lebanon. Rather than plead \nfacts concerning any direct connection between BLOM \nand Hamas, Plaintiffs have larded their Complaint with \nallegations about the Attacks, Hamas, and its allegedly \naffiliated charities, devoting fewer than 5 percent of the \nComplaint\u2019s 645 paragraphs to any discussion of BLOM.8\nAt the heart of Plaintiffs\u2019 theory are BLOM\u2019s alleged \naccounts for three charitable organizations: Subul Al-\nKhair, Union of Good, and the Sanabil Association for \nRelief and Development (\u201cSanabil\u201d) (collectively, the \n\u201cAlleged Account Holders\u201d). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0595, 623, 640. But \nPlaintiffs do not contend that any of the Alleged Account \nHolders committed any terrorist attacks or violent acts, \nlet alone the Attacks at issue.

These subsistence donations are alleged \nto have \u201cpurchase[d] support\u201d for Hamas in these areas, \nwhere Hamas allegedly competed with Hezbollah\u2019s \u201csocial \nwelfare infrastructure.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0570\u201374, 613, 629.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not plausibly suggest that \nBLOM knew of the Alleged Account Holders\u2019 alleged \naffiliations with Hamas during the relevant time period, \ni.e., before the Attacks. E.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00a0491. Rather, the \nComplaint alleges that, after the Attacks in this case, \nthe United States Treasury Department designated \nSanabil and Union of Good as Specially Designated Global \nTerrorists (\u201cSDGTs\u201d), which is different from an FTO.9 \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0590, 635.

In addition, Plaintiffs point to the alleged \ninvolvement of Hamas leadership in the charities, Compl. \n9.\u2002 The SDGT designation is a function of Executive Order \n13224, which covers, among other things, foreign persons who \n\u201cassist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological \nsupport for, or financial or other services to or in support of .\u00a0.\u00a0. \nacts of terrorism\u201d or \u201cdesignated persons.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0594.310, \n594.201(a); Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions \nwith Persons Who Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support \nTerrorism, 66 FR 49079, Exec.

In fact, the Complaint itself \nconcedes that Hamas engaged in many non- violent \u201csocial \nwelfare activities.\u201d E.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0513, 524, 526. Moreover, \nall of Plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations about the Alleged \nAccount Holders\u2019 purported connections to Hamas either \ndo not establish that those purported connections existed \nduring the relevant period (i.e., before the Attacks) or \ndo not show that BLOM would have been aware of such \nalleged connections before the Attacks.

Id. \u00b6\u00a0640.\nPlaintiffs try to pad their allegations about the \nAlleged Account Holders by lumping them with other \norganizations that allegedly transferred funds to the \nAlleged Account Holders. Specifically, Plaintiffs invoke \nInterpal, the Al-Aqsa Foundation (\u201cAl-Aqsa\u201d), the Holy \nLand Foundation (\u201cHLF\u201d), the Comit\u00e9 de Bienfaisance et \nde Secours aux Palestiniens (\u201cCBSP\u201d), and KindHearts \n(collectively, \u201cNon-Account Holders\u201d), none of which is \nalleged to be a BLOM customer. E.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00a0588. The \nfactual allegations regarding these Non-Account Holders \ndo not plausibly establish that BLOM was generally aware \nthat any of the Alleged Account Holders was engaged in \nviolent activities. Wholly apart from Plaintiffs\u2019 improper \n\nAppendix F\n172a\nconflation of designation as an SDGT with the conduct of \nterrorist activity, the United States is not alleged to have \never designated KindHearts\u2014a U.S. organization\u2014as \nan SDGT.10 With one exception, none of the other Non-\nAccount Holders was designated as a supporter of Hamas \nuntil either (a) after the last transfer to an Alleged \nAccount Holder that BLOM is alleged to have processed, \nsee Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0567, 569, 599 (transfers from HLF pre-\ndate its December 1, 2001 designation); or (b) after all \nof the Attacks alleged in the Complaint, see id. \u00b6\u00a0544, \n\u00b6\u00a076 (Aug. 22, 2003 designations of Interpal and CBSP \npost-date the last of the Attacks on Aug. 19, 2003).

(quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 570).\nThese universally applicable standards are all the \nmore important in this case, which threatens to impose \nmassive liability and treble damages on BLOM, who, even \n\nAppendix F\n174a\nunder the most generous reading of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, \ngave no assistance to the terrorists who harmed them, \nmuch less knowing and substantial assistance. Critically, \nPlaintiffs have come nowhere near sufficiently pleading \nthe Halberstam elements. They have failed to show BLOM \nknew that it was playing any role in violent terrorist \nactivities or that BLOM knowingly or substantially \nassisted the acts that resulted in Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. \nAt most, Plaintiffs have alleged that BLOM performed \nroutine, arms-length banking services for three customers, \nnone of whom was the perpetrator of the Attacks or was \ndirectly linked to the Attacks. Such allegations are not \nenough to establish the required elements of an ATA \naiding and abetting claim under JASTA.\nI. \t Plaintiffs Do Not Plead Sufficient Facts to Plausibly \nAllege That BLOM Was Aware It Played Any Role \nin Terrorist Activities.\nCourts have repeatedly emphasized that a JASTA \naiding and abetting claim requires a general awareness \nthat the defendant was itself assuming a role in the relevant \nterrorist activities.

Strauss, 2019 \nWL 1492902 at *8, *11; Weiss, 2019 WL 1441118 at \n*8, *11. The courts explained that \u201c[e]vidence that [a] \nDefendant knowingly provided banking services to a \nterrorist organization, without more, is insufficient to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s scienter requirement.\u201d Strauss, 2019 \nWL 1492902 at *11; accord Weiss, 2019 WL 1441118 at \n*11. Similarly, in Taamneh, allegations that defendant \nsocial media companies knew that ISIS (a designated \nForeign Terrorist Organization) had used their platforms \nto recruit members, raise funds, and spread propaganda \nwere insufficient to satisfy JASTA\u2019s scienter requirement. \n343 F.\u00a0Supp. at 917.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations here are far weaker than those \nin Strauss, Weiss, and Taamneh, and thus even more \nobviously fail to meet JASTA\u2019s scienter requirement. \nPlaintiffs have not adequately alleged that BLOM knew \nit was providing material support to a Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization, let alone any other facts that could establish \na plausible scienter showing. Plaintiffs do not allege that \nany of the Alleged Account Holders were ever designated \nas a Foreign Terrorist Organization. And while Plaintiffs \nallege that two Alleged Account Holders were designated \nas SDGTs after the Attacks, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0590, 635, that \ndid not make them a Foreign Terrorist Organization, \nlet alone at the relevant time period. As demonstrated \nby the Complaint\u2019s own quotation from the Treasury \nDepartment\u2019s designation of Sanabil as an SDGT, the \nSDGT label may be applied to organizations that provide \nnonviolent support to FTOs by means of charitable \n\nAppendix F\n177a\ncontributions. Compl. \u00b6\u00a0590; EO 13224 (providing that \norganizations can be designated as SDGTs if they \n\u201cprovide financial, material, or technological support \nfor, or financial or other services to or in support of\u201d \ndesignated persons). Indeed, it is not even clear that the \npost hoc designations of Sanabil and Union of Good as \nSDGTs for providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to an FTO would \nbe an adequate basis for imposing aiding and abetting \nliability on them under the ATA. See Linde, 882 F.3d 329 \n(\u201c[A]iding and abetting an act of international terrorism \nrequires more than the provision of material support \nto a designated terrorist organization.\u201d). A fortiori, it \nis insufficient to impose aiding and abetting liability on \nBLOM, their alleged banker.\nNor do Plaintiffs otherwise show that BLOM played \nany role in terrorist activities\u2014let alone that it was \naware of any such role. Instead, Plaintiffs allege that \ntwo Alleged Account Holders received funds from Non-\nAccount Holders who were themselves not designated \nas supporters of Hamas until after those transactions \noccurred. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0596, 599, 603, 604, 606, 623 (alleging \ntransfers from HLF, Interpal, CBSP, Al-Aqsa, and \nKindHearts to Sanabil and Subul al-Khair). But even \nthose Non-Account Holders were not Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations, and in any event, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \nutterly fail to show how BLOM could have known that \nthose entities supported a terrorist organization at the \ntime of the alleged transfers. Nor do the allegations \napproach establishing that BLOM was aware that its \nprovision of routine banking services played any role in \nterrorism. In short, as demonstrated by the discussion \n\nAppendix F\n178a\nof each of the Alleged Account Holders below, Plaintiffs \nhave wholly failed to allege that BLOM \u201cknew that the \nfinancial services it provided to [the Alleged Account \nHolders] would in turn be given to [terrorists] to carry out \nterrorist attacks.\u201d Siegel, 2018 WL 3611967 at *4.\nA. \t Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations About the Alleged Subul \nal-Khair Account Do Not Create a Plausible \nInference that BLOM Knowingly Played Any \nRole in Terrorist Activities.\nOn its own terms, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint plainly \nundermines any suggestion that BLOM knowingly played \nany role in terrorist activities by allegedly providing \nbanking services to Subul al-Khair, which was engaged \nin charitable and political activities, not violent ones. \nPlaintiffs allege that Subul al-Khair paid \u201csmall sums in \ncash\u201d that were designated for \u201c\u2018Orphan Sponsorships\u2019 \nand \u2018Student Sponsorships.\u2019\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0 626\u201327. But \nproviding social services to orphans and students in \na war-torn area could not alert BLOM that Subul al-\nKhair might be engaged in violent terrorist activities; \nthese funds concededly were used for \u201cbuying loyalty,\u201d \nin what the Complaint describes as \u201ca manner of an old-\nstyle political machine.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00a0627. Crucially, this alleged \ninfluence peddling is not purported to have had any \nactual connection to the Attacks or to the operatives who \ninflicted Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, none of whom is alleged to \nhave received \u201csmall sums in cash\u201d from Subul al-Khair \nor even to have lived in Lebanon. Thus, these allegations \ndo not reveal any connection between Subul al-Khair and \n\u201cviolent or life-endangering activities,\u201d meaning BLOM \n\nAppendix F\n179a\ncould not possibly have known that by providing banking \nservices to Subul al-Khair, it was assuming a \u201crole\u201d in \nany such (non-existent) activities. Linde, 882 F.3d at 229 \n(quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477).\nNothing in the Complaint plausibly alleges even \nthat BLOM would have known that Subul al-Khair was \nallegedly assisting Hamas through non-violent means. \nPlaintiffs do not and cannot claim that the United States \nhas ever designated Subul al-Khair as any type of terrorist \nentity. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0621\u201328. Nor can Plaintiffs hope to \nshow that BLOM knowingly played a role in the Attacks \nby alleging that Subul al-Khair received funds from the \nNon-Account Holders. While Plaintiffs claim that BLOM \n\u201cdeposited multiple transfers\u201d from HLF to Subul al-\nKhair, HLF was not itself accused of engaging in violence. \nId. \u00b6\u00a0623. Significantly, the Complaint does not specify \nwhen those alleged transfers took place, except to allege \ngenerally that \u201cHLF sent Subul al-Khair over $500,000 \nbetween 1999 and 2001.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00a0 625.15 Plaintiffs\u2019 other \nallegations, however, make it clear that the purported \nconnections between HLF and Hamas would not have \nbeen publicly available until after these alleged transfers. \nFor example, the U.S. did not designate HLF as an SDGT \nuntil the end of 2001, and the prosecution of HLF did not \nbegin until 2004. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0567, 622. And even if Subul al-\nKhair assisted HLF (which itself was not accused of any \nviolent acts), that does not remotely suggest that BLOM \n15.\u2002 The Complaint does not allege which of these transfers \nwas processed by BLOM.\n\nAppendix F\n180a\nplayed any role in assisting terrorist activities\u2014let alone \nthat BLOM was aware that it was playing any such role.\nB. \t Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations About the Alleged \nSanabil Account Do Not Create a Plausible \nInference that BLOM Knowingly Played Any \nRole in Terrorist Activities.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations about Sanabil likewise fail to \ncreate any plausible inference that Sanabil was involved \nin violent activities or that BLOM played any role in \nterrorism. Here, again, the Complaint affirmatively refutes \nPlaintiffs\u2019 legal theory: the Complaint characterizes \nSanabil\u2019s activities as charitable and political, not violent. \nE.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00a0590. The Complaint concedes that Sanabil \nwas a da\u2019wa institution, meaning part of the civilian social \nframework. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0 511, 526. Sanabil was purportedly \ntasked with channeling funds to \u201cPalestinian refugee \ncamps in Lebanon to build HAMAS\u2019s support within \nthat community,\u201d opening offices in refugee camps, \nasking poor families to fill out membership forms, and \ndistributing small sums of cash to individuals in refugee \ncamps \u201cunder the categories of \u2018Orphan Sponsorships,\u2019 \n\u2018Student Scholarships,\u2019 \u2018Needy Sponsorships\u2019 and \u2018Family \nSponsorships.\u2019\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0526, 588, 589, 590, 611.\nSanabil\u2019s later designation by the United States as an \nSDGT does not establish that Sanabil engaged in violent \nactivity. Id. \u00b6\u00a0590. Rather, it shows only that Sanabil was \nbelieved to have provided material support to Hamas, id., \nwhich (under Linde) would be insufficient to establish ATA \naiding and abetting liability for Sanabil. 882 F.3d at 329.\n\nAppendix F\n181a\nPlaintiffs\u2019 other allegations about Sanabil are even \nless relevant to the question of whether BLOM was aware \nthat it was playing a role in violent terrorism (which it was \nnot). Indeed, they are woefully insufficient to establish \nliability\u2014even for Sanabil\u2014under JASTA\u2019s aiding and \nabetting provision. See Linde, 882 F.3d at 329\u201330:\n\u2022 \tThe Complaint claims that \u201cSanabil\u2019s board \nmembers were predominantly well- known HAMAS \nleaders in Lebanon,\u201d without saying what roles \nthose board members allegedly played in Hamas \nleadership or when they assumed those roles. See \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0591\u201394. Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to assign guilt \nby association are undermined by the Complaint\u2019s \nconcessions that Hamas does engage in non- violent \nactivities. E.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0513, 524, 526.\n\u2022 \tThe Complaint claims that Sanabil\u2019s office in Sidon \n(some 30 miles south of Beirut) closed at some point \nin 2003 \u201cfollowing a ruling from the Lebanese \njudiciary.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00a0609. But the Complaint does not \nallege any details about the purported ruling or why \nBLOM should have been aware of it at the relevant \ntime. Indeed, the sole Lebanese press report cited \nin the Complaint that discusses the ruling was \npublished on August 27, 2004\u2014i.e., one year after \nthe last of the Attacks\u2014attributes the ruling to \nthe Ministry of the Interior, and characterizes it \nas a licensing issue. Id. \u00b6\u00a0610; see Closure of US \nterror-designated charity shatters many lives, The \nDaily Star Lebanon, (August 27, 2004), http://www.\ndailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2004/Aug-\n\nAppendix F\n182a\n27/2799-closure-of-us-terror-designated-charity-\nshatters-many-lives.ashx.\n\u2022 \tPlaintiffs contend that Sanabil paid Palestinian \nfamilies and followed orders from Hamas political \nleaders. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0 589, 610. But these general \naccusations\u2014allegedly made public only after the \nlast Attack in this case\u2014do not link Sanabil to any \nterrorist act, much less to any of the Attacks.\nThe Complaint attempts to distract from these \nshortcomings by highlighting Sanabil\u2019s alleged connections \nto the Non-Account Holders. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0596\u2013607, 618, 623, 625. \nBut these allegations do not raise an inference that BLOM \nwas \u201cgenerally aware\u201d it was playing a role in terrorist \nactivities before the Attacks. The last of the alleged \ntransfers from HLF to Sanabil was made on September \n7, 2001, three months before HLF was designated as an \nSDGT.16 Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0567, 599. Interpal and CBSP were not \ndesignated as SDGTs until after the last of the Attacks. \nThe sole transfer made by Al-Aqsa to Sanabil after Al-\nAqsa was designated as an SDGT was earmarked for \n\u201cHELP CONCERNING ORPHAN CHILDREN,\u201d not for \nany violent activity. Id. Ex. D at 2. And, other than these \npost hoc designations, the Complaint provides no basis \nto infer that BLOM knew that the Non-Account Holders \n16.\u2002 Especially given that HLF had offices in the United \nStates, the timing of this designation substantially undermines \nPlaintiffs\u2019 attempt to imply that BLOM might have known of \nHLF\u2019s association with Hamas earlier. After all, even the United \nStates government was not yet confident enough of a link to take \naction against HLF.\n\nAppendix F\n183a\nallegedly sending funds to Sanabil had any connection \nto a Foreign Terrorist Organization.17 See, e.g., Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0 596, 603, 606. Processing routine transfers to an \nAlleged Account Holder\u2014which itself is not alleged to \nhave engaged in any violent activity\u2014could not possibly \namount to \u201ca \u2018role\u2019 in Hamas\u2019s violent or life- endangering \nactivities.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329.\nC. \t Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations About the Alleged Union \nof Good Account Do Not Create a Plausible \nInference That BLOM Knowingly Played Any \nRole in Terrorist Activities.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the Union of Good \ndo not even attempt to satisfy any element of JASTA\u2019s \nrequirements. The Complaint\u2019s sole allegation purporting \n17.\u2002 See, e.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0555\u201364, 566 (reviewing information \nabout HLF obtained through FBI investigations but not stating \nwhen such information became public); id. \u00b6\u00a0 565 (discussing \nthat some Hamas leaders were brothers, cousins, or related by \nmarriage to HLF officers); id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0541\u201342 (discussing Israel\u2019s \nconclusions that Interpal and CBSP were linked with Hamas \nprior to the U.S. designation without explaining how BLOM would \nhave known of Israel\u2019s conduct given that it did not have offices \nthere); id. \u00b6\u00a0546 (claiming that Interpal was designed to \u201chide \nthe flow of money to HAMAS\u201d (emphasis added)); id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0550\u201352 \n(alleging Israel and Germany took steps against Al-Aqsa prior \nto the U.S. designation, but not explaining how BLOM could \nhave known about these steps given that it did not have offices in \neither country); id. \u00b6\u00a0614 (alleging KindHearts worked \u201csecretly \nand independently .\u00a0.\u00a0. , attempting to maintain a public distance \nfrom HAMAS to avoid drawing attention to its affiliation with the \nterrorist organization\u201d).\n\nAppendix F\n184a\nto connect BLOM to Union of Good is that \u201c[t]he Union of \nGood maintained account no. 349647 at one of Defendant \nBLOM BANK\u2019s branches located on the prestigious \nVerdun Street in Beirut.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00a0640. But Plaintiffs \ndo not say when Union of Good created this account, \nhow long it was maintained, or whether there were any \ntransactions in it. As a result, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \nregarding Union of Good are meaningless because it is \nimpossible to know whether this account was maintained \nor used before or after the relevant time period in this \ncase. See In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., 502 F.3d 47 \n(2d Cir. 2007) (\u201cWithout an adequate allegation of facts \nlinking transactions in Europe to transactions and \neffects here, plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory allegations do not \n\u2018nudge[ their] claims across the line from conceivable to \nplausible.\u2019\u201d (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570) (alterations \nin original)). Thus, there can be no serious contention \nthat BLOM assumed a \u201crole\u201d in terrorist activities by \nproviding financial services to Union of Good, let alone \nthat it was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that it was assuming such \na \u201crole.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329.\n*\u00a0*\u00a0*\nIn sum, the Complaint alleges that BLOM provided \narms-length, routine banking services to organizations \nthat were later revealed to have some non-violent \nconnection to Hamas. None of the allegations, if true, \nwould plausibly establish that BLOM was \u201c\u2018generally \naware\u2019 that, in providing financial services, [it] was \nthereby playing a \u2018role\u2019 in an FTO\u2019s violent or life-\nendangering activities.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan, 2019 WL 1409446 at \n\nAppendix F\n185a\n*10 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 329). On that basis alone, \nthe Complaint should be dismissed.\nII.\t Plaintiffs Do Not Plead Sufficient Facts Tending \nto Demonstrate That BLOM Knowingly Provided \nSubstantial Assistance to the Wrongful Acts That \nCaused Their Injuries.\nThe Complaint also fails to plead facts demonstrating \nthat BLOM knowingly provided substantial assistance to \nthe principal violations that caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. To \nproperly plead an aiding and abetting claim, Plaintiffs \nmust prove that a defendant \u201cknowingly provid[ed] \nsubstantial assistance\u201d to the primary tortfeasor. 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d); see also Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477 \n(requiring that \u201cthe defendant must knowingly and \nsubstantially assist the principal violation\u201d). As already \nestablished above, Plaintiffs cannot show that any \nassistance provided by BLOM was \u201cknowing\u201d because \nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that BLOM knew \nthat any of the Alleged Account Holders were involved \nwith terrorism at the relevant times. And, even setting \nthat aside, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that BLOM\u2019s \nprocessing of financial transactions was \u201csubstantial \nassistance.\u201d Under Linde and Halberstam, courts must \nweigh multiple factors to determine whether the assistance \nprovided by a defendant was \u201csubstantial\u201d: \u201c(1) the nature \nof the act encouraged, (2) the amount of assistance given \nby defendant, (3) defendant\u2019s presence or absence at the \ntime of the tort, (4) defendant\u2019s relation to the principal, (5) \ndefendant\u2019s state of mind, and (6) the period of defendant\u2019s \nassistance.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329; accord Halberstam, \n\nAppendix F\n186a\n705 F.2d at 483\u201384; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts \n\u00a7\u00a0876 (1979). Each of those factors cuts decisively against \nany such finding in this case.\nRoutine nature of the banking activities. The \nnature of the relevant acts strongly weighs against \nfinding substantial assistance. This element is aimed at \ndetermining \u201cwhat aid might matter, i.e., be substantial.\u201d \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 484. The acts allegedly \nencouraged here were the Attacks against Plaintiffs in \nIsrael. Given the violent nature of those Attacks, BLOM\u2019s \nalleged support\u2014the limited and unwitting provision of \nbasic financial services to charity organizations providing \nsocial services to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon\u2014is \nhardly the type of support that \u201cmight matter.\u201d Id. Indeed, \non this element, this case is not at all like Halberstam, \nwhere the act assisted was a burglary enterprise that \nwas \u201cheavily dependent on aid in transforming large \nquantities of stolen goods into \u2018legitimate\u2019 wealth\u201d and \nwhere the defendant\u2019s \u201cassistance was indisputably \nimportant to this laundering function.\u201d Id. at 488. BLOM\u2019s \nalleged assistance was exponentially more attenuated \nand not even remotely connected to the Attacks at issue. \nNotably, Plaintiffs do not allege BLOM donated money \nto the Alleged Account Holders, nor do they allege that \nBLOM\u2019s banking services directly supported any terrorist \nactions. Rather, BLOM is alleged to have provided \nroutine, passive banking services through which one set \nof ostensibly charitable organizations donated money to \nother ostensibly charitable organizations that in turn \nprovided social services to refugees who are not alleged \nto have had any role in the Attacks that caused Plaintiffs\u2019 \n\nAppendix F\n187a\ninjuries. Such unwitting and indirect (non)assistance \ncannot reasonably be considered \u201cindisputably important\u201d \nto the Attacks at issue here, nor is there any indication \nthat those Attacks would have been any less likely to \noccur without BLOM\u2019s banking services. Halberstam, \n705 F.2d at 488.\nLimited amount of alleged assistance. The amount \nand kind of assistance also weighs in BLOM\u2019s favor. \nThe alleged assistance here includes routine banking \nservices, in arms-length transactions, to organizations \nthat purported to be legitimate charities at the time of the \nrelevant transactions. Indeed, the alleged assistance here \nis far less than the alleged assistance in Taamneh, where \nsocial media companies were said to have allowed ISIS \nto use their platforms to recruit, raise funds, and spread \npropaganda. 343 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 917\u201318. The Taamneh \ncourt rejected the argument that the alleged assistance \nthere was substantial given that \u201cthe relationship between \nDefendants and ISIS [w]as an arms\u2019-length one\u2014a market \nrelationship at best. Rather than providing targeted \nsupport .\u00a0.\u00a0. Defendants provided routine services generally \navailable to members of the public.\u201d Id. Here, the alleged \nassistance is similarly arms-length but significantly less \ndirect.\nIndeed, Plaintiffs\u2019 own conduct reveals the \ninsignificance of BLOM\u2019s alleged assistance. Plaintiffs \nbegan bringing claims based on these Attacks in 2003. \nSee, e.g., supra note 3. But it was not until fifteen years \nlater, in the hours before the extension of the limitations \nperiod expired, that Plaintiffs levied any claim against \n\nAppendix F\n188a\nBLOM. In the meantime, they have filed numerous suits \ntargeting actors with far more substantial connections \nto the Attacks or Hamas\u2019s violent activities. See, e.g., \nKirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-\n01708, ECF No. 4 \u00b6\u00a022 (D.D.C.

Arab Bank, \n\nAppendix F\n189a\nNot present at the Attacks. The presence factor most \nobviously weighs against substantial assistance. Plaintiffs \ndo not suggest that BLOM (headquartered in Beirut and \nwith no presence or operations in Israel) was present at \nany of the Attacks in Israel\u2014or even that it knew or should \nhave known that any violence would come from its conduct.\nNo relation to the alleged attackers. Likewise, even \nunder Plaintiffs\u2019 telling, BLOM\u2019s \u201crelation to\u201d the terrorist \norganization or individual terrorists who were responsible \nfor the Attacks was severely attenuated, at best. Taking \nPlaintiffs\u2019 non-conclusory allegations in the most generous \nlight, BLOM is alleged to have had a business relationship \nwith charitable organizations that later were determined \nto have provided social services in refugee camps where \nHamas allegedly sought to recruit new members. E.g., \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0588, 626. Such twice- removed allegations fail \nto sufficiently \u201callege any direct relationship\u201d between \nthe defendants and \u201cthe terrorist organizations that were \nresponsible for the [relevant] attack[s].\u201d See Siegel, 2018 \nWL 3611967 at *4. Moreover, there are no allegations \nthat any of the Alleged Account Holders, much less \nBLOM, held a position of authority over the individuals \nwho perpetrated the Attacks or was part of a concerted \nactivity to assist them. See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 484.\nPLC, No. 1:18-cv-02192, ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00a0243 (E.D.N.Y.

Finally, Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged facts suggesting that BLOM in any way \nencouraged Hamas\u2019 terrorist acts or provided moral \nsupport for the Attacks. As detailed above, it is not even \nadequately alleged that BLOM knew that the Alleged \nAccount Holders were affiliated with Hamas at all.\nIn the end, considering the Halberstam factors \nseparately and together, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fall \nwoefully short of plausibly implying that \u201cthe financial \nservices [BLOM] provided [to its accountholders] \nsubstantially assisted terrorist organizations in carrying \nout\u201d the Attacks. Siegel, 2018 WL 3611967 at *4.\nIII. Plaintiffs Do Not Plead Sufficient Facts Tending \nto Demonstrate That BLOM\u2019s Routine Banking \nServices Directly Assisted the Actors Who Caused \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Injuries.\nUnder JASTA, a defendant is liable for aiding \nand abetting only if it directly aided and abetted the \n\u201cperson\u201d who committed the relevant \u201cact of international \nterrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2).19 Indeed, Halberstam \nrequires that \u201cthe party whom the defendant aids must \nperform a wrongful act that causes an injury,\u201d 705 F.2d \nat 487, because aiding and abetting liability is concerned \nwith the relationship between the alleged aider and \nabettor and the principal violator, not the alleged aider and \n19.\u2002 \u201cPerson\u201d is defined to include \u201cany individual or entity \ncapable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02331(3).\n\nAppendix F\n191a\nabettor and other alleged aiders and abettors. Siegel, 2018 \nWL 3611967 at *4. For example, in Siegel, the plaintiffs \nasserted an aiding and abetting claim against HSBC and \nits affiliates based on a terrorist attack perpetrated by \nal-Qaeda and al-Qaeda in Iraq (the \u201cal-Qaeda Attack\u201d). Id. \nat *1. The plaintiffs claimed that HSBC and its affiliates \nhad served as correspondent banks to Al Rajhi Bank, \nwhich was directly connected to the al-Qaeda Attack \nbecause purchases and expenses directly related to the \nal-Qaeda Attack were underwritten through funds that \nmoved through Al Rajhi Bank. Id. at *2. But the aiding \nand abetting claim was dismissed because the plaintiffs \nhad failed to \u201callege any direct relationship with the \nterrorist organizations\u201d responsible for the al-Qaeda \nAttack, instead alleging only \u201cHSBC\u2019s direct relationship \nwith another financial institution.\u201d Id. at *4.\nSo too here. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations come nowhere \nclose to establishing a \u201cdirect relationship\u201d between \nBLOM and the persons who caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Id. \nPlaintiffs allege that the Attacks at issue were committed \nby 15 individual terrorist operatives (collectively, \u201cthe \nAttackers\u201d). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a013, 76, 207, 240, 299, 318, 339, \n390, 407, 413, 486, 491; see also id. \u00b6\u00a0414 (not identifying \nthe individuals who detonated a car bomb near the Ben \nYehuda Street bombings). But nothing in the Complaint \ncould be construed as showing that BLOM directly aided \nand abetted\u2014or even actually knew of\u2014any one of the \nactual Attackers. In fact, the Attackers\u2019 individual names \ndo not appear anywhere in the Complaint except in the \nallegations describing the Plaintiffs.\n\nAppendix F\n192a\nIV. \tAdditionally and Alternatively, Certain Individual \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claims Require Dismissal.\nAt the very least, a number of individual plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims must be dismissed, either because any damages \nthey suffered were not proximately caused by an act of \ninternational terrorism, or because they are brought by \nsomeone who is not a United States national, and hence \nnot eligible to seek damages under the ATA except as a \nsurvivor of a United States national.\nA. \t The Steinherz Family\u2019s Injuries Were Not \nProximately Caused by an Act of Terrorism.\nThe Steinherz family\u2019s allegations fail to establish \nthat any of their injuries were proximately caused \nby the Attack on Ben Yehuda Street, to which they \nattribute their injuries. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0413\u2013414, 465\u201385. \nThus, their claims must be dismissed. ATA aiding and \nabetting liability requires a showing that the relevant \nterrorist incident was the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 \ninjuries. See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487 (requiring that \n\u201cthe party whom the defendant aids must perform a \nwrongful act that causes an injury\u201d).20 Accordingly, the \nalleged terrorist act must be a \u201csubstantial factor in the \nsequence of responsible causation\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s \n\u201cinjury [must be] reasonably foreseeable or anticipated \n20.\u2002 See also Rothstein v. UBS AG, 708 F.3d 82, 94\u201395 (2d \nCir. 2013) (holding that primary liability ATA claims require the \ndefendant to have proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury); 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d) (providing aiding and abetting claims must arise \nfrom a primary liability claim).\n\nAppendix F\n193a\nas a natural consequence of the attack.\u201d Rothstein, 708 \nF.3d at 91 (emphasis added); accord Crosby, 921 F.3d at \n624. Causation is not sufficiently pleaded if an intervening \nevent breaks the chain of causation. Id. at 92.\nHere, Altea and Jonathan Steinherz do not allege \nthey were at the Ben Yehuda Street bomb site, but rather, \nat a \u201cnearby\u201d restaurant. Compl. \u00b6\u00a0467. They plead they \nsustained their injuries while running from \u201ca crazed-\nlooking man\u201d they saw after the bombing was over and \nafter they concluded it was safe to go outside.

Rothstein, 708 F.3d at 92. The Steinherz\u2019s \ninjuries are properly characterized as being among \n\u201c\u2018ripples of harm\u2019\u201d that \u201c\u2018flow far beyond the defendant\u2019s \nmisconduct,\u2019\u201d lacking the requisite \u201csubstantial[], direct[], \nand foreesabl[e]\u201d relationship with the terrorist Attack \nnecessary to maintain the Steinherz family\u2019s aiding and \nabetting claims.

The Complaint alleges the Attacks \nwere perpetrated by the designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization (\u201cFTO\u201d) HAMAS during a period of near-\ndaily terrorism commonly referred to as the \u201cSecond \nIntifada.\u201d In order to carry out this multi- year terror \ncampaign against innocent civilians, HAMAS required a \nsteady infusion of U.S. dollars, which it obtained largely \nvia a network of fundraising institutions (self-described \n\u201ccharities\u201d), including its European fundraising network. \nA significant portion of that money flowed through \nHAMAS\u2019s networks in Lebanon, where it maintained a \nsignificant and well-known presence. Defendant BLOM \nBank Sal (\u201cBLOM\u201d) was HAMAS\u2019s banker in Lebanon, and \nit directed millions of dollars from HAMAS fundraising \ninstitutions abroad to the terrorist organization.\nPlaintiffs therefore allege that BLOM is responsible \nfor aiding and abetting HAMAS in committing the Attacks \nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d), added to the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d) in 2016 through the Justice Against Sponsors of \nTerrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d). As BLOM points out, Plaintiffs \nhere (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) have sued \nother financial institutions and entities for their respective \nroles in causing most of the Attacks. However, BLOM \nomits that courts and juries have consistently found as \ntriable or proven facts that (1) those financial institutions \nknew or were deliberately indifferent to the fact that they \nheld accounts for HAMAS fundraisers designated as \nSpecially Designated Global Terrorists (\u201cSDGTs\u201d) (and \nthat they knew that even before those institutions were \nso designated), (2) the support those financial institutions \nprovided to HAMAS proximately caused those plaintiffs\u2019 \n\nAppendix G\n199a\ninjuries, and (3) such conduct raises cognizable JASTA \nclaims (most recently in Miller and Lelchook, see infra \nat 10-11).\nIn the face of the detailed pleadings and this prior \nprecedent, BLOM\u2019s arguments consist of a series of \nalternative fallback positions: its customers were SDGTs, \nnot FTOs, and therefore BLOM did not support HAMAS \nitself, BLOM\u2019s Mem. of Law (\u201cDef. Mem.\u201d) at 8-9, 13-14; \neven if BLOM was aiding and abetting HAMAS, the \nsupport it provided only went to HAMAS\u2019s \u201ccharitable\u201d \npurposes, id. at 14-16; even if BLOM knowingly aided \nand abetted HAMAS and HAMAS used the funding it \nreceived from BLOM for violent purposes, that support \ndid not constitute a substantial and foreseeable cause of \nHAMAS\u2019s terrorist attacks on Plaintiffs, id. at 9- 10, 21; \neven if BLOM\u2019s customers were alter-egos or controlled \nby HAMAS, BLOM did not know that at the relevant \ntime, id. at 14-15; and finally, even if BLOM knew it was \naiding and abetting HAMAS and providing it substantial \nassistance that foreseeably caused HAMAS\u2019s terrorist \nattacks on Plaintiffs, \u00a7\u00a0 2333(d) requires that BLOM \nspecifically aid and abet \u201cthe person\u201d who committed \nthe Attacks, and BLOM therefore cannot be held liable \nbecause the Complaint does not allege it aided and abetted \nthe individual terrorist responsible for the Attacks, id. at \n25. These arguments mix factual assertions and preferred \nevidentiary inferences that are\u2014at best\u2014appropriate \nfor resolution by summary judgment or trial, with legal \nassertions that are incorrect. Faced with controlling \ncaselaw and relevant jury findings that strongly suggest \nthat Plaintiffs have adequately pled claims under \u00a7\u00a02333(d) \n\nAppendix G\n200a\nand that the Complaint\u2019s assertions are questions of fact, \nnot law, BLOM relies on inapposite or out-of-circuit cases \n(that misstate or are at odds with the governing law in \nthis Circuit), and urges the Court to draw unreasonable \ninferences from the evidence.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nHAMAS is a terrorist organization committed to\u2014\naccording to its official charter\u2014the establishment of an \nIslamic, Palestinian state in the entire territory of Israel \nthrough violent \u201cjihad\u201d (holy war). Compl. \u00b6\u00a0508. At its \nfounding, HAMAS was led by Ahmed Yassin (or \u201cSheikh \nYassin\u201d). Id. \u00b6\u00a0510. In the early 1990s, HAMAS sought to \ndisrupt peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians \nby: (1) upgrading its terror apparatus by perfecting its \nbomb-making skills and improving the capabilities of its \nmilitary wing; (2) intensifying its efforts to systematically \ngain control of pre-existing \u201ccharitable\u201d and other \nreligious and social institutions to form HAMAS\u2019s da\u2019wa \nnetwork1 to win the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the Palestinian \npublic in Gaza, the West Bank and the Palestinian refugee \ncamps in Jordan and Lebanon; and (3) accelerating the \ndevelopment of its world-wide fundraising network. Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0522-25.\nIn 1994, HAMAS established BLOM\u2019s customer \nthe Sanabil Association for Relief and Development \n1.\u2002 The word \u201cda\u2019wa,\u201d whose basic meaning in Arabic is \u201cthe \ncall to the believers to shelter beneath the faith\u2014return to the \nfaith,\u201d is used herein to refer to HAMAS\u2019s civilian infrastructure.\n\nAppendix G\n201a\n(\u201cSanabil\u201d) in Lebanon.

Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0526, 576-585.\n\t\nHAMAS\u2019s Fundraising Apparatus\nHAMAS\u2019s fundraising activities became public \nknowledge soon after it was formed. In 1994, The New \nYork Times reported:\nHAMAS funding of all its activities is estimated \nby the Israelis at about $30 million a year. It \ncomes from money collected by associations \noperating largely abroad but with ties to the \ninternational Muslim Brotherhood network. \nMoney is also collected from Islamic and Arab \ncommunities in the United States and .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . \nWestern European locations.\nId. \u00b6\u00a0528. A 2001 Washington Post article reported that, \n\u201c[a]ccording to [Sheikh] Yassin, [HAMAS] distributes $2 \nmillion to $3 million in monthly handouts to the relatives \nof Palestinian suicide bombers; \u2018martyrs\u2019 who have been \nkilled by Israelis; and prisoners in Israeli jails.\u201d Id. \n\u00b6\u00a0530. Immediately after Israel launched its operation \nin southern Lebanon in 1996 to end Hezbollah\u2019s rocket \nattacks on Northern Israel, Sanabil distributed more \nthan $100,000 to the inhabitants of the southern regions \n\nAppendix G\n202a\nof Lebanon. Id. \u00b6\u00a0575. Over time, Lebanon also became an \nimportant conduit for HAMAS funding of its operatives \nin the Palestinian Territories. Id. \u00b6\u00a0587.\nThe outbreak of the Second Intifada in September \n2000 was a key turning point in HAMAS\u2019s history. Id. \n\u00b6\u00a07. During the conflict, HAMAS launched hundreds \nof terrorist attacks targeting civilians that resulted in \nthe deaths and injury of hundreds of civilians, including \nnumerous American citizens. Id. \u00b6\u00a012. Also, during that \nperiod, the U.S. Treasury Department designated (as \nSDGTs) several HAMAS fundraising organizations \nthat purported to be \u201ccharities,\u201d including Holy Land \nFoundation (\u201cHLF\u201d) on December 4, 2001,2 id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0567, \n603, and Al-Aqsa Foundation on May 29, 2003, id. \u00b6\u00a0553. \nOn August 22, 2003, Treasury designated the Comit\u00e9 de \nBienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens (\u201cCBSP\u201d), of \nFrance, the Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, \nor Interpal, headquartered in the United Kingdom, \nand Sanabil (along with others) as \u201cpart of a web of \ncharities raising funds on behalf of HAMAS and using \nhumanitarians [sic] purposes as a cover for acts that \nsupport HAMAS.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0543-45.\n2.\u2002 As set forth in greater detail in the Complaint, HLF was \na U.S.-based HAMAS fundraising entity that (in addition to five \nof its former directors) was convicted for transferring more than \n$12 million to HAMAS through various HAMAS-controlled \ncommittees and organizations located in Palestinian-controlled \nareas and Lebanon after HAMAS was designated. The convictions \nwere upheld by the Fifth Circuit. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 560-69.\n\nAppendix G\n203a\n\t\nDefendant BLOM Bank Customer: Sanabil\nBLOM\u2019s accountholder Sanabil was HAMAS\u2019s da\u2019wa \nheadquarters in Lebanon until late 2003. Id. \u00b6\u00a0588. As \nTreasury explained in designating it on August 22, 2003:\n[Sanabil] receives large quantities of funds \nraised by major HAMAS-affiliated charities \nin Europe and the Middle East and, in turn, \nprovides funding to HAMAS. For example, \nSanabil has received funding from the Al Aqsa \nFoundation (designated as an SDGT under EO \n13224 in May 2003); the Holy Land Foundation \nfor Relief and Development (designated as an \nSDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001), and \nInterpal (designated as an SDGT under EO \n13224 as part of this tranche). HAMAS recruits \npermanent members from the religious and \nthe poor by extending charity to them from \norganizations such as Sanabil.\nAt the request of a HAMAS political leader, \nSanabil began opening offices in all of the \nPalestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in August \nof 2001 in order to increase the foundation\u2019s role \ninside the camps. After starting by providing \nbasic necessities the charity eventually began \nasking poor families within the camps to fill \nout application forms, particularly those who \nhad worked with the Islamic Movement (Al-\nHaraka al-Islamiyya) and HAMAS. As a result \nof these efforts, Sanabil has increased its scope \nof influence within the camps.\n\nAppendix G\n204a\nId. \u00b6\u00a0590. In fact, between 1998 and 2001, Sanabil received \nmillions of dollars in support from HAMAS\u2019s fundraising \nnetwork and channeled those funds to the Palestinian \nrefugee camps in Lebanon to build HAMAS\u2019s support \nwithin that community. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0596, 610-12.\nSanabil\u2019s board members were predominantly \nwell-known HAMAS leaders in Lebanon. For example, \nSanabil board member Ahmed Muhammad Abd al-Hadi \nwas HAMAS\u2019s deputy representative and spokesman \nin Lebanon (and is currently HAMAS\u2019s senior leader in \nLebanon). Id. \u00b6\u00a0591. Abdallah Atawat, one of HAMAS\u2019s \nprincipal fundraisers in Lebanon, served as Sanabil\u2019s \nDeputy Chairman of the board of trustees and as a board \nmember of the Welfare Association for Palestinian and \nLebanese Families (subsequently designated an SDGT). \nId. \u00b6\u00a0592. Other members of HAMAS\u2019s leadership in \nLebanon who served as trustees of Sanabil included \nMashhur Abd al-Halim, who served as HAMAS\u2019s \nPalestinian relations representative in Lebanon, and \nZiyad Qamr, a HAMAS political official. Id. \u00b6\u00a0594.\nDuring the relevant period, Sanabil held account no. \n12-02-44037-728529-1 with BLOM. Id. \u00b6\u00a0595. Between 1998 \nand 2001, HLF transferred over $2 million (U.S.) through \nBLOM\u2019s correspondent bank accounts in New York to \nSanabil\u2019s BLOM account(s) in Lebanon. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0596-602.3 \n3.\u2002 BLOM asserts that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 own conduct reveals the \ninsignificance of BLOM\u2019s alleged assistance,\u201d because the millions \nof dollars it transferred to HAMAS occurred 15 years ago but \nPlaintiffs did not sue BLOM earlier. Def. Mem. at 22. BLOM\u2019s \nlogic is unclear, but this cause of action was brought subsequent \nto and under JASTA\u2019s 2016 enactment.\n\nAppendix G\n205a\nAfter HLF\u2019s December 2001 designation, its successor \norganization KindHearts sent an additional $250,000 to \nSanabil\u2019s accounts between July 2002 and July 2003. Id. \n\u00b6\u00a0603. Between 1999 and 2003, BLOM also processed \nfund transfers though its New York correspondent banks \nfrom CBSP and Interpal to Sanabil in amounts estimated \nto exceed $1 million. Id. \u00b6\u00a0606. During this time period, \nSanabil served as Interpal\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d representative in \nLebanon, and the U.S. government identified Sanabil as an \nunindicted co-conspirator in the HLF prosecution, calling \nit a \u201cpart of the Global HAMAS financing mechanism.\u201d \nId. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0607-08.\nRecords seized from HLF show that Sanabil regularly \ndistributed small sums in cash from its accounts to \nhundreds (if not thousands) of individual dependents \nin the Palestinian refugee camps under the categories \nof \u201cOrphan Sponsorships,\u201d \u201cStudent Sponsorships,\u201d \n\u201cNeedy Sponsorships\u201d and \u201cFamily Sponsorships.\u201d Id. \n\u00b6\u00a0611. The beneficiaries were provided \u201cmembership ID \nnumbers\u201d and were paid small amounts individually in the \nmanner of an old-style political machine, buying loyalty in \nperiodic stipends of $40-$50 per quarter. Id. \u00b6\u00a0612. BLOM \nfacilitated these \u201csponsorships,\u201d providing the mechanism \nthrough which HAMAS was able to purchase support in \nits target areas.\n\t\nDefendant BLOM Bank Customer: Subul al-Khair\nSubul al-Khair is a small HAMAS institution founded \nin Beirut, Lebanon in 1998 that was identified as an \nunindicted co-conspirator in HLF\u2019s criminal trial. Id. \n\nAppendix G\n206a\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0621-22. BLOM maintained an account for Subul al-\nKhair at its Rawsheh branch in Beirut (no. 0227534) and \ndeposited multiple transfers HLF sent to Subul al-Khair. \nId. \u00b6\u00a0623. Ostensibly, Subul al-Khair functioned in much \nthe same way Sanabil did but was geographically focused \non HAMAS supporters in the Beirut area. Records seized \nfrom HLF show that HLF sent Subul al-Khair over \n$500,000 between 1999 and 2001. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0624-25.\n\t\nDefendant BLOM Bank Customer: Union of Good\nThe Union of Good was established in October 2000 as \nthe umbrella organization for HAMAS\u2019s global fundraising \nactivity. Id. \u00b6\u00a0629. It began as a 101-day fundraising drive \nfor emergency aid at the outset of the Second Intifada, \nchaired by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the Muslim \nBrotherhood\u2019s spiritual leader and famous television \npersonality in the Arab world. Id. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0630-32; 636-38.4 \nAccording to Al-Qaradawi, \u201cmartyr operations\u201d\u2014that is, \nsuicide attacks\u2014are \u201cthe greatest of all sorts of Jihad in \nthe Cause of Allah.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00a0630. In sum, the Union of Good \nand its senior leadership were not clandestine, but open, \nwell-known and prominent supporters of HAMAS and \nproponents of terror attacks on Israeli civilians.\nOn February 25, 2002, the Union of Good was \ndesignated by Israel as being \u201cpart of the Hamas \norganization or supporting it and strengthening its \ninfrastructure.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00a0634. Treasury designated the Union \nof Good as an SDGT on November 12, 2008, finding:\n4.\u2002 The Muslim Brotherhood Movement was established in \nEgypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna and was dedicated to fighting \nWestern influences on Muslim society. Id. \u00b6 510 n.5.\n\nAppendix G\n207a\nUnion of Good acts as a broker for HAMAS by \nfacilitating financial transfers between a web \nof charitable organizations\u2014including several \norganizations previously designated under E.O. \n13224 for providing support to HAMAS\u2014and \nHAMAS-controlled organizations in the West \nBank and Gaza. The primary purpose of this \nactivity is to strengthen HAMAS\u2019 political and \nmilitary position in the West Bank and Gaza, \nincluding by: (i) diverting charitable donations \nto support HAMAS members and the families \nof terrorist operatives; and (ii) dispensing social \nwelfare and other charitable services on behalf \nof HAMAS.\nFunds raised by the Union of Good affiliates \nhave been transferred to HAMAS- managed \norganizations in the West Bank and Gaza. In \naddition to providing cover for HAMAS financial \ntransfers, some of the funds transferred by the \nUnion of Good have compensated HAMAS \nterrorists by providing payments to the \nfamilies of suicide bombers. One of them, the \nAl-Salah Society, previously identified as a key \nsupport node for HAMAS, was designated in \nAugust 2007 under E.O. 13224. The Society \nemployed a number of members of the HAMAS \nmilitary wing and supported HAMAS-affiliated \ncombatants during the first Intifada.\nId. \u00b6\u00a0635.\n\nAppendix G\n208a\nAs with Sanabil, HAMAS leaders have also served \nopenly in the Union of Good\u2019s executive leadership. For \nexample, the Secretary General of the Union of Good, \nEssam Salih Mustafa Yussuf, also acted as Interpal\u2019s \nVice-Chairman while serving on HAMAS\u2019s executive \ncommittee under then-HAMAS leader Khalid Mishal.

The JASTA amendment \n5.\u2002 Without the benefit of discovery, Plaintiffs cannot assess \nthe size and scope of the Union of Good\u2019s account activity at BLOM. \nHowever, given BLOM\u2019s well-documented support for HAMAS\u2019s \nother fundraising institutions and the importance of the Union of \nGood to HAMAS\u2019s fundraising network, it is not only plausible \nbut likely that discovery will reveal that the account at BLOM was \nsignificant to HAMAS.\n\nAppendix G\n209a\nwas explicitly added to expand the relief already available \nto civil litigants under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(a):\nThe purpose of this Act is to provide civil \nlitigants with the broadest possible basis, \nconsistent with the Constitution of the United \nStates, to seek relief against persons, entities, \nand foreign countries, wherever acting and \nwherever they may be found, that have provided \nmaterial support, directly or indirectly, to \nforeign organizations or persons that engage \nin terrorist activities against the United States.\nJASTA, \u00a7\u00a02(b).

Citing the Supreme Court in \nHolder v.

BLOM \nalso cites two out-of-circuit cases brought under the ATA \nagainst Twitter and other social media providers whose \nlanguage analyzing JASTA at least facially conflicts with \nLinde: Taamneh v. Twitter, Inc., 343 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 904, 916 \n(N.D. Cal. 2018) and Crosby v. Twitter, Inc., 303 F.\u00a0Supp. \n3d 564, 580 (E.D. Mich. 2018), aff\u2019d, 921 F.3d 617 (6th Cir. \n2019). Whereas Linde held that JASTA did not require \nallegations that the defendant knew of the \u201cspecific \nattacks at issue\u201d and does not require Plaintiffs to prove \nBLOM\u2019s \u201cintent to participate in a criminal scheme,\u201d the \ncases BLOM relies upon did. Lastly, BLOM relies upon \nthe recent dismissals of the Strauss case against Cr\u00e9dit \nLyonnais and the Weiss case against NatWest. Each of \nthese cases is addressed below.\nto an FTO without being generally aware of its role in terrorist \nactivities (and without foreseeing such terrorist activities as a \nnatural consequence of such support).\n\nAppendix G\n216a\na. \t Siegel\nIn Siegel, plaintiffs were injured in three suicide \nbombings in Jordan perpetrated by Al Qaeda and Al \nQaeda in Iraq (\u201cAQI\u201d) in 2005. They sued HSBC and \nits U.S. subsidiary (\u201cHBUS\u201d) under the ATA for failing \n\u201cto take reasonable steps to ensure that HBUS was not \ndealing with banks that may have links to or that facilitate \nterrorist financing. HBUS opened U.S. correspondent \naccounts for high risk affiliates without conducting \ndue diligence, thereby facilitating transactions that \nhindered U.S. efforts to stop terrorists.\u201d Siegel, 2018 \nWL 3611967, at *1. Plaintiffs there claimed that HBUS \nprovided correspondent banking services to Al Rajhi \nBank (\u201cARB\u201d), knowing \u201cthat ARB was associated with \nterrorist financing and that ARB provided accounts to \nclients linked with terrorism.\u201d Id.\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately \nplead their \u00a7\u00a02333(d) claims, the court noted that the \ncomplaint:\ndoes not allege any direct relationship with the \nterrorist organizations that were responsible \nfor the November 9 Attack. It describes instead \nHSBC\u2019s direct relationship with another \nfinancial institution, ARB. It is ARB that is \nalleged to have provided banking services \nto the terrorist organizations. It accuses the \ndefendants of adopting slipshod banking \npractices, and operating with inadequate \nanti-money laundering controls, but it does \n\nAppendix G\n217a\nnot adequately allege that the defendants \nwere aiding the terrorist organizations that \nperformed the November 9 Attack. For \ninstance, it does not adequately allege that the \ndefendants were even generally aware that \nthe financial services they provided ARB were \ndirectly assisting those terrorist organizations, \nor even that the financial services they provided \nARB substantially assisted the terrorist \norganizations in carrying out the November 9 \nAttack.\nId. at *4 (emphasis added).\nSiegel correctly held that negligence is insufficient \nto satisfy \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d under \u00a7\u00a02333(d), but its \nconcluding language is sufficiently imprecise as to invite \nBLOM\u2019s reliance here:\nEven if the TAC alleged that services the \ndefendants provided to ARB directly supported \nAQI and al-Qaeda, which it does not, that would \nbe insufficient. The TAC does not allege that the \ndefendants were generally aware that they were \nplaying a role in the November 9 Attack. As the \nSecond Circuit has noted, \u201caiding and abetting \nan act of international terrorism requires more \nthan the provision of material support to a \ndesignated terrorist organization.\u201d\nId. at *5 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 329).\n\nAppendix G\n218a\nHad the plaintiffs adequately alleged that ARB \nknowingly supported AQI and Al Qaeda, that would have \nbeen sufficient at least at the pleading stage to also allege \nARB\u2019s (not the HSBC defendants\u2019) general awareness of \nits role in those terrorist groups\u2019 illicit scheme. The court\u2019s \nfocus was understandably on the general awareness of \nthe HSBC defendants, but to the extent its language can \nplausibly be interpreted to suggest that Linde required (at \ntrial) a showing that a defendant had awareness of it role \nin a specific terrorist attack, that formulation is incorrect. \nJust as the defendant in Halberstam was unaware of the \nmurder that gave rise to her liability, the Second Circuit \nin Linde explicitly stated that plaintiffs need not show \nthat a bank \u201cknew of the specific attacks at issue when it \nprovided financial services for Hamas.\u201d 882 F.3d at 329.\nb. \t Crosby\nIn Crosby, plaintiffs were victims and family members \nof deceased victims of the mass shooting at the Pulse \nNight Club in Orlando, Florida perpetrated by Omar \nMateen on June 12, 2016. They sued Twitter, Google \nand Facebook, which allegedly provided social media \nplatforms used by the FTO Islamic State of Iraq and \nSyria (\u201cISIS\u201d), alleging that these platforms allowed \nMateen to hear ISIS\u2019s messages via the Internet and \nbecome radicalized, thereby triggering their liability for \nthe shooting. Because those plaintiffs appear not to have \nalleged that ISIS knew anything about the attack before \nit occurred and apparently conceded that Mateen never \nhad contact with any agent or entity directly connected \nto ISIS, the district court focused on the defendants\u2019 \n\nAppendix G\n219a\ngeneral awareness of their role in aiding and abetting \nMateen rather than their alleged assistance to ISIS. 303 \nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 573. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding that \nthe plaintiffs failed to adequately allege proximate cause. \n921 F.3d 617, 625 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 only allegation that connects \nMateen and Defendants is that, at some point before the \nPulse Night Club shooting, Mateen viewed online content \nfrom ISIS and became \u2018self-radicalized.\u2019\u201d). It also found \nthat the plaintiffs failed to satisfy \u00a7\u00a02333(d)\u2019s standing \nrequirement because there were no plausible allegations \nthat ISIS \u201ccommitted, planned, or authorized\u201d the Pulse \nNight Club attack. Id. at 626. The facts of that case are \nself-evidently divergent from those here, where HAMAS \nis alleged to have committed the Attacks, aided directly \nby BLOM. See supra at 10 n.6.\nc. \t Taamneh\nIn Taamneh, American relatives of a Jordanian \nnational killed in a terrorist attack in Istanbul sued \nTwitter, Google (as owner of YouTube), and Facebook, \nfor providing material support to and aiding and abetting \nISIS, because they \u201crefused to actively monitor [their] \nonline social media networks\u201d and \u201cgenerally only \nreviewed ISIS\u2019s use of [their] services in response to \nthird party complaints. In some instances, even after \nbeing alerted, Defendants found that ISIS did not violate \ntheir policies and allowed the ISIS-affiliated accounts to \nremain active.\u201d 343 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 907 (internal citations \nomitted). The plaintiffs also claimed that the terrorist who \nperpetrated the attack was \u201cradicalized by ISIS\u2019s use of \nsocial media.\u201d Id.\n\nAppendix G\n220a\nSetting aside that these allegations raise a very \ndifferent issue with respect to proximate cause, Taamneh \nrequired allegations that the defendant directly aid and \nabet the individual terrorist and the attack itself, quoting \nthe Crosby district court\u2019s requirement of allegations \nthat defendants \u201caided or abetted the person (Mateen) \nwho committed the night club attack,\u2019\u201d id. at 916 (quoting \nCrosby, 303 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 573), and Siegel\u2019s requirement \nthat defendants \u201cwere generally aware that they were \nplaying a role in the November 9 Attack,\u201d id. (quoting \nSiegel, 2018 WL 3611967, at *5). It further stated that \n\u201crequiring secondary liability to be connected with a \nspecific crime would be consistent with the common law\u2019s \nunderstanding of aiding and abetting,\u201d which included, \ninter alia, \u201cthat the accused had the specific intent to \nfacilitate the commission of a crime by another, [and] \nthat the accused had the requisite intent to commit the \nunderlying substantive offense.\u201d Id. (quoting United States \nv. Hernandez-Orellana, 539 F.3d 994, 1006-07 (9th Cir. \n2008), a criminal case). These findings conflict with Linde, \nwhich specifically held that general awareness does not \nrequire knowledge of specific attackers or attacks or \u201cthe \nspecific intent demanded for criminal aiding and abetting \nculpability.\u201d 992 F.3d at 329. Thus, Taamneh facially \nconflicts with both Halberstam and Linde.\nd. \t Weiss and Strauss\nFinally, BLOM relies on the recent dismissals of Weiss \nand Strauss, two cases where the district court found, on \na trial-ready record, that two European banks could not \nhave been generally aware of their respective roles in their \n\nAppendix G\n221a\ndesignated SDGT customers\u2019 and HAMAS\u2019s continuing \ncriminal enterprise because the customers had \u201costensibly \ncharitable purposes\u201d and the plaintiffs failed to either (a) \ntrace the banks\u2019 assistance either to HAMAS\u2019s specific \nattacks on the plaintiffs or (b) establish that the HAMAS-\ncontrolled institutions that received the assistance \nthemselves perpetrated or otherwise participated in \nthe attacks giving rise to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. See \nStrauss v. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, S.A., No. 06-cv-702(DLI)\n(RML), 2019 WL 1492902, *6-7 (E.D.N.Y.

These decisions were \nerroneous, and the \u201ctracing requirement\u201d they articulate \nis mistaken. As this District Court previously observed:\nCommon sense requires a conclusion that \nCongress did not intend to limit recovery to \nthose plaintiffs who could show that the very \ndollars sent to a terrorist organization were \nused to purchase the implements of violence \nthat caused harm to the plaintiff. Such a burden \nwould render the statute powerless to stop \nthe flow of money to international terrorists, \nand would be incompatible with the legislative \n\nAppendix G\n222a\nhistory of the ATA. See, e.g., S.Rep. No. 102-\n342 at 22. (\u201cNoting that Congress intended to \nimpose \u2018liability at any point along the causal \nchain of terrorism.\u2019\u201d).\nGoldberg v. UBS AG, 660 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 410, 429 (E.D.N.Y. \n2009). JASTA\u2019s stated purpose was to expand ATA \nliability further. See Linde, 882 F.3d at 328 (describing \nJASTA as an \u201cexpansion\u201d of the ATA). Weiss and Strauss \nare under appeal; but in any event, they are the product \nof a full evidentiary record and were not dismissed at the \npleading stage.\n2. \t The Complaint Plausibly Alleges That \nBLOM Was Generally Aware of Its Role \nin HAMAS\u2019s Terrorist Activities.\nAs in Halberstam and Linde, Plaintiffs must allege \nthat BLOM was \u201cgenerally aware of [its] role\u201d in \u201cterrorist \nactivities,\u201d from which terrorist attacks were a natural and \nforeseeable consequence. Although courts are expected \nto be \u201clenient in allowing scienter issues.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to survive \nmotions to dismiss,\u201d In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser \nAntitrust Litig., 585 F.3d 677, 693 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted), see also Weiss, 768 \nF.3d 202 at 211 (same), the Complaint sets forth many \nspecific allegations that provide a strong inference of \nBLOM\u2019s awareness of its role in HAMAS\u2019s fundraising \nactivities, including the central fact that it held accounts \nfor three HAMAS institutions during the relevant period: \nSanabil, an SDGT; Subul al- Khair; and the Union of Good, \nalso an SDGT.

Moreover, the allegations here identify \nSanabil as (a) a \u201ccharity\u201d HAMAS established (b) that \nreceived millions of dollars in international donations (c) \nprimarily from organizations designated by Israel, the \nUnited States and, in one case, European governments \nas well, that (d) distributed these funds in the form of \nsmall, cash payments.

Terror financing and the resulting \nterrorist attacks are almost uniquely offensive. Therefore, \nwhen a defendant is aware of a risk that it is assisting an \nFTO (in this case through designated customers), applying \nHalberstam\u2019s \u201cproportionality test to particularly bad or \nopprobrious acts,\u201d is particularly important.

Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 483-84. The Second \nCircuit explained that \u201c[d]isputed facts pertinent to these \nfactors and the weight to assign such factors\u201d are factual \nissues for the trier of fact and not matters that can be \ndetermined as a matter of law.

Here, BLOM\u2019s facilitation of millions of dollars \nin international fundraising for HAMAS and conversion \nof those funds into cash for HAMAS to dispense to \nits supporters must be evaluated in the context of the \nenterprise they aided: HAMAS\u2019s terror financing and \nthe foreseeable consequences of providing substantial, \ncontemporaneous support to that terrorist organization.\nAlthough BLOM asserts that it did not \u201cdonate[] \nmoney to the Alleged Account Holders,\u201d Def. Mem. at 21, \nJASTA requires no such allegation. See Linde, 882 F.3d at \n327 (holding that a jury must decide whether \u201cproviding \nroutine financial services\u201d\u2014or whether those services \nshould even be \u201cviewed as routine\u201d\u2014qualifies as acts of \ninternational terrorism). Financial services of the kind \nBLOM provided to HAMAS are crucial to moving large \nsums of money across borders, which is why 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a02339A(b)(1) explicitly criminalized \u201cfinancial services\u201d \nas a form of material support. JASTA\u2019s statutory purpose \nis to provide victims of terrorism a remedy against those \nwho \u201chave knowingly or recklessly provided material \nsupport or resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons \n\nAppendix G\n232a\nor organizations responsible for their injuries.\u201d JASTA \u00a7\u00a07 \n(emphasis added). See also id. \u00a7\u00a06 (\u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d). \nThe Complaint alleges in detail direct material support \nBLOM provided to HAMAS and even attaches examples \nof that support.\nAmount of Assistance.

The Halberstam court noted that \u201calthough the \namount of assistance Hamilton gave Welch may not have \nbeen overwhelming as to any given burglary in the five-\nyear life of this criminal operation, it added up over time \nto an essential part of the pattern.\u201d Id. BLOM allegedly \nprovided HAMAS those millions of dollars over several \nyears during the Second Intifada. See, e.g., Compl. \u00b6\u00a0599.\nPresence at the time of the tort. In Halberstam, \n\u201cHamilton was admittedly not present at the time of \nthe murder or even at the time of any burglary,\u201d but \n\u201cthe success of the tortious enterprise clearly required \nexpeditious and unsuspicious disposal of the goods, and \nHamilton\u2019s role in that side of the business was substantial.\u201d \nId. at 488. BLOM was also not \u201cpresent at the scene\u201d \nof HAMAS\u2019s terror attacks, but the U.S. government \ndesignations of HLF and the Al-Aqsa Foundation, as well \nas the designations of BLOM\u2019s customers, Sanabil and the \nUnion of Good, strongly suggest that HAMAS\u2019s \u201ctortious \nenterprise\u201d substantially depended on the funds raised \nand distributed with BLOM\u2019s assistance.\n\nAppendix G\n233a\nState of Mind. The Halberstam court held that \n\u201cevidence as to the state of mind of the defendant may \nalso be relevant to evaluating liability.\u201d 705 F.2d at 484. \nSpecifically, the court found that both knowing assistance \nand continuous participation evidence \u201ca deliberate \nlong-term intention to participate in an ongoing illicit \nenterprise,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cpassing fancy or impetuous \nact.\u201d 705 F.2d at 488. BLOM\u2019s knowing provision of \nfinancial services to HAMAS customers throughout the \nSecond Intifada was no \u201cpassing fancy.\u201d See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0595, \n623, 640.\nBLOM, on the other hand, argues that \u201ca defendant \nis liable for aiding and abetting only if it directly aided \nand abetted the \u2018person\u2019 who committed the relevant \n\u2018act of international terrorism.\u2019\u201d Def.

Id. at 25. Section 2333(d)(1), however, \ncontains no such requirement or any textual basis for the \nargument. Setting aside JASTA\u2019s stated statutory purpose \nto provide victims of terrorism a remedy against those who \n\u201chave knowingly or recklessly provided material support \nor resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons or \norganizations responsible for their injuries,\u201d JASTA \u00a7\u00a07 \n(emphasis added), \u00a7\u00a02333(d)\u2019s text explicitly defines the \nword \u201cperson\u201d as having \u201cthe meaning given the term in \nsection 1 of title 1.\u201d That definition \u201cinclude[s] corporations, \ncompanies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, \nand joint stock companies, as well as individuals,\u201d 1 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01 (emphasis added). If \u00a7\u00a02333(d) only applies to \n\nAppendix G\n234a\naiding and abetting individual terrorists, \u00a7\u00a01\u2019s definition \nis superfluous. Moreover, no one has ever been physically \nattacked by a corporation or joint stock company. Hence, \nthe Second Circuit in Linde did not dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 \n\u00a7\u00a02333(d) claims against Arab Bank due to insufficient \nevidence that the defendant aided and abetted each suicide \nbomber. 882 F.3d at 331.\nFurther, BLOM\u2019s view would require tracing \nits transactions on behalf of the HAMAS-controlled \ninstitutions directly to each attack. This argument has \nbeen repeatedly rejected, as any support to an FTO \nsupports the terrorist attacks it commits: \u201cCongress \nand the Executive .\u00a0.\u00a0. have concluded that .\u00a0.\u00a0. designated \nforeign terrorist organizations \u2018are so tainted by their \ncriminal conduct that any contribution to such an \norganization facilitates that conduct.\u2019\u201d Holder, 561 U.S. at \n38 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02339B note). The Supreme Court \nhas explained why that is the case:\nMoney is fungible, and when foreign terrorist \norganizations that have a dual structure \nraise funds, they highlight the civilian and \nhumanitarian ends to which such moneys could \nbe put. But there is reason to believe that \nforeign terrorist organizations do not maintain \nlegitimate financial firewalls between those \nfunds raised for civil, nonviolent activities, \nand those ultimately used to support violent, \nterrorist operations. Thus, funds raised \nostensibly for charitable purposes have in the \n\nAppendix G\n235a\npast been redirected by some terrorist groups \nto fund the purchase of arms and explosives.\nId. at 31 (internal citations omitted) (relying on Executive \nand Congressional findings that are entitled to \u201cdeference\u201d \nand \u201csignificant weight\u201d).

The Second Circuit first addressed \nallegations against al-Rajhi Bank brought under \u00a7\u00a02333(a) \nin In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2011 (\u201cAl \nRajhi\u201d), 714 F.3d 118, 124 (2d Cir. 2013) (allegations that \nbank maintained accounts for an Al Qaeda fundraising \norganization (later designated an SDGT) insufficient to \nplead proximate cause where organization itself was not \nalleged to be an alter ego of Al Qaeda and complaint did \nnot contain any specific allegation that defendant\u2019s account \nfor organization were used to transmit funds to Al Qaeda). \nIn Siegel, the plaintiffs pled a causal relationship at least \none further step removed from the allegations in Al Rajhi, \nseeking to hold one of Al Rajhi\u2019s U.S. correspondent banks \n(HBUS) liable under the ATA for negligently maintaining \nan account for Al Rajhi Bank itself on the theory that Al \nRajhi had been credibly accused of supporting terrorist \norganizations and, nevertheless, HBUS provided it with \ncorrespondent banking services. Setting aside the fact \nthat the ATA does not recognize claims predicated on \nnegligence, Siegel\u2019s allegations stand in stark contrast \nto those set forth in the Complaint here, which explicitly \nalleges that BLOM knowingly transferred funds from \nHAMAS fundraisers to its own customers (at least one \nof which \u2013 Sanabil \u2013 is alleged to have been a HAMAS \nalter ego), which exclusively provided funding to HAMAS. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0588, 623-24, 635-40.\nBLOM\u2019s reliance on Crosby fares no better. As \ndetailed above, in Crosby, the plaintiffs failed to allege \nthat the terrorist who injured them had any pre-existing \nconnection to ISIS, the terrorist group using defendant \n\nAppendix G\n237a\nTwitter\u2019s social media platform. Here, the sufficiency \nof Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations setting forth HAMAS\u2019s \nresponsibility for the Attacks is not disputed, the \nrelationship between BLOM\u2019s customers and HAMAS \nhas been detailed by the U.S. government in multiple \nofficial designations and criminal prosecutions, and bank \nrecords establishing BLOM\u2019s financial services on behalf \nof multiple HAMAS fundraising SDGTs are attached as \nexhibits to the Complaint.\nII. \tBLOM\u2019S CH A LLENGES TO SPECIFIC \nPLAINTIFFS\u2019 STANDING ARE MERITLESS.\nA. \t The Steinherz Family\u2019s Injuries Were a \nReasonably Foreseeable Consequence of Their \nAttack.\nBLOM contends that the claims of Plaintiffs Altea \nand Jonathan Steinherz and their family members should \nbe dismissed, characterizing the circumstances of their \nphysical and emotional injuries as \u201ceasily an intervening \ncause that broke the chain of causation.\u201d Def. Mem. at \n26 (internal citations omitted).14 On the contrary, these \ninjuries, suffered when Ms. Steinherz was nine months \npregnant and attempting to flee with her husband from \nthe site of the December 1, 2001 Ben Yehuda Street \nbombings (a coordinated double-suicide bombing and car \nbombing at a pedestrian mall), Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0413-14, 465-\n85, were \u201creasonably foreseeable consequence[s]\u201d of the \n14.\u2002 In their May 3, 2019 letter to the Court requesting a pre-\nmotion conference, BLOM referred to the circumstances of the \nSteinherzs\u2019 injuries as a \u201cslip-and-fall.\u201d ECF No. 20 at 3.\n\nAppendix G\n238a\nattack. Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487. The facts in Crosby, \ncited by BLOM in support of its argument, prompted \nthe court there to comment that \u201ca butterfly in China is \nnot the proximate cause of New York storms,\u201d and hold \nthat a public social media platform used by ISIS was not \nliable for an attack perpetrated by a lone gunman with \nno connection to ISIS that watched ISIS content. 921 \nF.3d 617, 623, 624-25. But the Steinherzs\u2019 injuries were \nsustained while fleeing from nearby suicide bombings \nand a coordinated car bomb designed to target first \nresponders.15 They and every other person in the vicinity, \nwhether they were killed or injured in the blast or simply \nwitnessed the carnage, were within the zone of intended \nand foreseeable harm. See, e.g., In re Farm Family \nCasualty Ins. Co. (Trapani), 753 N.Y.S.2d 198, 200 (N.Y. \nApp. Div. 2003) (permitting individual injured during a \nfall she incurred while running away from sparks raining \ndown on her from a powerline that was struck by a vehicle \nto recover from the vehicle owner\u2019s motorist insurance \npolicy). Not only were the three coordinated bombings \nnot \u201cso remote in either time or space from [Plaintiffs\u2019] \ninjuries,\u201d id., their very purpose was to sow fear and panic \nnot only in bystanders in or near the blast zone but also \nin the wider public as well. Thus, the Steinherz family\u2019s \nclaims should not be dismissed.\n15.\u2002 BLOM states that the Steinherz plaintiffs \u201cdo not allege \nthey were at the Ben Yehuda Street bomb site, but rather, at a \n\u2018nearby\u2019 restaurant.\u201d Def. Mem. at 26. Ben Yehuda Street is an \noutdoor pedestrian mall. Victims situated at the \u201cbomb sites\u201d \ndid not survive the blasts. The Steinherz family members were \namong the hundreds of patrons walking, shopping or dining in \nthe targeted area.\n\nAppendix G\n239a\nB. \t Plaintiff Matanya Nathansen Has Standing \nto Bring Claims on Behalf of His Murdered \nThree-Year-Old Daughter.\nAs the Plaintiffs apprised this Court in their letter \ndated May 22, 2019, ECF No. 26, they are not voluntarily \ndismissing the claims of Plaintiff Matanya Nathansen, the \nfather of Tehilla Nathansen, a three-year old U.S. citizen \nmurdered in a suicide bombing on August 19, 2003 while \nsitting on her mother\u2019s lap aboard a bus. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a076-77, \n132-39. Mr. Nathansen indisputably has standing to bring \nan action under \u00a7\u00a02333(a). BLOM therefore appears to \nbe challenging his right to pursue a higher measure of \ndamages predicated on the totality of the circumstances \nof the attack, which include his own physical injuries and \nthe serious injuries sustained by his wife and surviving \ndaughters. In reviewing solatium claims in Foreign \nSovereign Immunity Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d) Terrorism Exception \ncases, courts have taken a holistic approach:\nSolatium, as an award for \u201cinjury to feelings,\u201d \nis difficult to articulate in mathematical or \nnumerical terms. A court\u2019s job in a solatium \ncase is to account for various facts and \ncircumstances, and to use those factors to \narrive at an appropriate numerical expression \nof total pain and grief\u2014encapsulated in the \nsolatium award.\nOveissi v.

Arab Bank, PLC, 882 \nF.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018) preclude Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. And \nPlaintiffs\u2019 response to BLOM\u2019s motion does not remotely \nsuggest otherwise. Instead, they invite this Court to apply \na mens rea standard that the Second Circuit has explicitly \nrejected, rely on misleading snippets from pre-JASTA \nprecedents, and complain that recent decisions supporting \nBLOM\u2019s motion are \u201cerroneous.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 17. Their \n1.\u2002 Capitalized terms not defined here are defined in BLOM\u2019s \nopening brief (\u201cBLOM Br.\u201d).\n\nAppendix H\n244a\nbaseless plea for discovery does not cure these defects. \nTheir Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.\nI.\t The Complaint Fails to Plausibly Satisfy JASTA\u2019s \nMens Rea Requirement.\nPlaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege facts that would \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s mens rea standard. To state a claim under \nJASTA, Plaintiffs must plausibly allege that \u201cin providing \n[financial] services, the bank was \u2018generally aware\u2019 that \nit was thereby playing a \u2018role\u2019 in Hamas\u2019s violent or life-\nendangering activities.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329\u201330; see \nalso id. at 330 (defendant must be generally aware it was \n\u201cplaying a role in violent or life-endangering acts whose \napparent intent was to intimidate or coerce civilians or \nto affect a government\u201d). But Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations could \nnot plausibly support a finding that BLOM knew it was \nplaying a role in any violent or life-endangering activities. \nAt most, Plaintiffs urge that BLOM had \u201cawareness of its \nrole in HAMAS\u2019s fundraising activities,\u201d without alleging \nthat BLOM\u2019s alleged customers committed any violent \nor life-threatening acts or that BLOM was aware of such \nacts. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 18. To the contrary, Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition \nconcedes that the Alleged Account Holders were at most \npart of Hamas\u2019 \u201cda\u2019wa\u201d civil structure. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 3.\nInstead of complying with the legal standard \narticulated by the Second Circuit in Linde, Plaintiffs \nmisstate it. Their brief repeatedly omits Linde\u2019s \nreferences to \u201cviolent or life-endangering activities,\u201d even \nwhen quoting the immediately surrounding language. E.g., \nPls.\u2019 Br. at 10\u201313, 17. Then, relying on cases decided before \n\nAppendix H\n245a\nJASTA was enacted, Plaintiffs insist that the statute \ndemands only that a defendant participate in activities \ncarrying a foreseeable risk that terrorist activities might \nresult. E.g., Pls.\u2019 Br. at 11 (citing Weiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster \nBank PLC, 768 F.3d 202, 208\u201309 (2d Cir. 2014); Strauss v. \nCredit Lyonnais, S.A., 925 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 414, 432 (E.D.N.Y. \n2013)). As a result, Plaintiffs incorrectly seek to replace \nJASTA\u2019s mens rea requirement with the lower standard \nrequired for material support claims. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 11.\nBut Linde forecloses that sleight of hand. The Linde \nplaintiffs had brought primary liability claims under the \nATA, which required them to prove that they were injured \n\u201cby reason of an act of international terrorism.\u201d Linde, \n882 F.3d at 320; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(a). An act qualifies as \n\u201cinternational terrorism\u201d only if it \u201cinvolve[s] violence \nor endanger[s] human life.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 326. The \nLinde trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that if \nthe defendant had provided material support to an FTO, \nthat finding \u201cnecessarily proved the bank\u2019s commission of \nan act of international terrorism.\u201d Id. at 325. On appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held that this instruction was wrong \nbecause the \u201cprovision of material support to a terrorist \norganization does not invariably equate to an act of \ninternational terrorism.\u201d Id. at 326.\nIn doing so, the Second Circuit rejected the theory \nproffered by Plaintiffs here. The Linde plaintiffs, \nrepresented by the same counsel, had argued that the \nincorrect instruction was harmless because the \u201cpost-trial \nenactment of JASTA .\u00a0.\u00a0. eliminate[d] the need to prove \nthat Arab Bank\u2019s own actions involved violence or danger \n\nAppendix H\n246a\nand appeared intended to intimidate or coerce civilians or \nto influence or affect governments.\u201d Id. at 328. The Second \nCircuit disagreed, holding instead that to be liable under \nJASTA, a defendant must be \u201cgenerally aware\u201d it was \n\u201cplaying a \u2018role\u2019 in [an FTO\u2019s] violent or life endangering \nactivities.\u201d Id. at 329.2\nThe \u201ctwo recent JASTA decisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. related to terror \nfinancing\u201d cited by Plaintiffs confirm that the \u201cviolent \nor life endangering activities\u201d requirement is central to \nLinde\u2019s holding. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 10. In Lelchook v. Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, No. 16-cv-07078, 2019 WL 2647998, at \n*4 (E.D.N.Y. June 27, 2019), the Court held that JASTA\u2019s \nmens rea standard requires that a defendant bank be \n\u201c\u2018generally aware\u2019 that it was playing a \u2018role\u2019 in Hezbollah\u2019s \nviolent or life-endangering activities.\u201d And, in Miller v. \nArab Bank, PLC, 372 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 33, 47 (E.D.N.Y. 2019), \nthe Court held that to satisfy JASTA, a defendant \u201cmust \nhave been \u2018generally aware that it was thereby playing a \nrole in Hamas\u2019s violent or life-endangering activities.\u2019\u201d \nAs explained in BLOM\u2019s opening brief, even accepting \n2.\u2002 Indeed, the court held that the Linde jury\u2019s finding that \nArab Bank \u201cprovided material support in the form of financial \nservices to what it knew was a designated terrorist organization\u201d \nwas legally insufficient to establish a JASTA aiding and abetting \nclaim. Id. (emphasis added). As detailed in BLOM\u2019s opening brief, \nPlaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that BLOM knew it was \nproviding financial services to a designated terrorist organization. \nBLOM Br. at 13\u201320. Thus, as acknowledged by the fact that \nthey have not alleged a primary violation of the ATA against \nBLOM, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations here do not even rise to the level of \nestablishing material support.\n\nAppendix H\n247a\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true, they cannot support a \nplausible inference that BLOM played a role in Hamas\u2019s \nviolent or life-endangering activities, let alone that BLOM \nknew it was playing such a role. BLOM Br. at 16\u201319.\nNor can Plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of JASTA\u2019s stated \n\u201cpurpose\u201d in its legislative history cure the deficiencies \nin their Complaint. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 8\u20139. Rather, the legislative \nevolution of JASTA supports the importance of the \nstatute\u2019s mens rea standard. JASTA\u2019s statement of \npurpose was originally drafted in 2009. S. 2390, 111th \nCong. \u00a7\u00a02 (as introduced in Senate, Dec. 23, 2009). It was \nnot materially modified in the seven years before the \nstatute was enacted in 2016. By contrast, Congressional \ndebate during that period resulted in significant tightening \nof the mens rea element. In 2009, JASTA\u2019s proposed mens \nrea element required only that a \u201cperson or entity .\u00a0.\u00a0. \naided, abetted, provided material support or resources \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the person or persons who committed such \nan act of international terrorism.\u201d S. 2390, 111th Cong. \n\u00a7\u00a05(d) (emphasis added). A later version of the bill struck \nthe \u201cmaterial support\u201d language. S. 1535, 113th Cong. \n\u00a7\u00a04 (as introduced in Senate, Sept. 19, 2013). And finally, \nto get the votes needed to pass JASTA in the House, the \nSenate heightened the mens rea standard for aiding and \nabetting by requiring that a Defendant must \u201cknowingly \nprovid[e] substantial assistance.\u201d3 Plaintiffs cannot rely \n3.\u2002 See Statement of Sen. Cornyn, Exec. Business Meeting, \nS. Comm. on the Judiciary, Jan. 28, 2016 (explaining that an \namendment modifying the aiding and abetting standard was made \n\u201cin order to gain consensus for [the] legislation\u201d) video available \nat https://bit.ly/2XVyJWl (beginning at 50:55); S. 2040, 114th \n\nAppendix H\n248a\nupon general \u201cpurpose\u201d language to undermine JASTA\u2019s \nexplicit mens rea requirement\u2014especially when that \nrequirement was added in order to obtain the votes needed \nto enact the statute.\nII.\t The Complaint Fails to Allege that BLOM \nKnowingly Provided Substantial Assistance Either \nto HAMAS or to the Individual Attackers.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail to create a plausible \ninference that Hamas was a BLOM customer or that \nBLOM provided any assistance to any person or entity \ndirectly involved with the Attacks. In fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 \ninsistence that the allegations in this case resemble the \nfacts in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. \n1983), reveals only how far short the Complaint falls \nfrom alleging the elements of knowledge and substantial \nassistance.\nCong., Manager\u2019s Amendment SIL16008(adopted by S.

As \nexplained in BLOM\u2019s opening brief, Plaintiffs have not \nalleged facts that plausibly come close to satisfying that \nrequirement. Despite Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory labeling of \nBLOM as \u201cHAMAS\u2019s banker,\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 1, Plaintiffs \nidentify only three Alleged Account Holders, none of which \nwas Hamas or any other FTO. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0588, 623, 640.\nPlaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the Alleged \nAccount Holders were agents or aliases of Hamas, \nlet alone that BLOM knew that they were during the \nrelevant time period. To establish an agency or alias \nrelationship, plaintiffs must allege that one organization \n\u201cso dominates and controls\u201d a separate juridical entity \n\u201cthat the latter can no longer be considered meaningfully \nindependent from the former.\u201d Weiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster \nBank PLC, 453 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 609, 623 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). In \nmaking that determination, courts consider, among other \nthings, \u201cwhether the organizations share leadership, \nwhether they comingle finances, publications, offices and \n4.\u2002 Plaintiffs erect a strawman when they contend that BLOM \nis arguing for a \u201ctraceability\u201d requirement. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 26. BLOM \nhas done no such thing. Under JASTA, Plaintiffs must show that \nBLOM aided and abetted the \u201cperson\u201d who carried out the Attacks, \nwhich the Complaint does not do with respect to either Hamas or \nthe Attackers.\n\nAppendix H\n250a\npersonnel, and whether one operates as a division of the \nother.\u201d Id. \u201cMerely providing financial support\u201d or even \n\u201csupporting the terrorist objective of an FTO\u201d will \u201cnot \nsuffice to show that an organization is so dominated and \ncontrolled so as to have lost its independent identity.\u201d Id. \nRather, Plaintiffs must plausibly allege that the supposed \nalias was either \u201ccontrolled by\u201d or \u201crun on behalf of\u201d the \nterrorist organization. Id. Moreover, because Plaintiffs \nare required to show that BLOM \u201cknowingly\u201d provided \nsubstantial assistance, Plaintiffs must also plausibly \nallege that BLOM knew of the Alleged Account Holders\u2019 \npurported relationship with Hamas. See Linde, 882 F.3d \nat 329.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations fall far short of that standard. \nThe Complaint does not allege that any of the Alleged \nAccount Holders comingled finances, publications, offices, \nor personnel with Hamas during the relevant time period. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 barebones allegations that BLOM knew of \nshared leadership between Hamas and Sanabil or Union \nof Good depends upon (i) their SDGT designations, which \ndid not occur until after all of the Attacks in this case, \n(ii) the designation of Union of Good by Israel, a country \nin which BLOM does not operate, or (iii) the conclusory \nassertion that, at some unspecified time, it was supposedly \n\u201cwell-known\u201d that certain Sanabil board members were \nalso Hamas leaders.

Those designations were \n\nAppendix H\n251a\neither made after the last of the Attacks, or (with respect \nto HLF) no transfers are alleged to have been made \nafter the designation. BLOM Br. at 18\u201319. And Plaintiffs\u2019 \nreliance upon a single transfer to Alleged Account Holder \nSanabil from Non-Account Holder Al-Aqsa one day after \nAl-Aqsa was designated as an SDGT, Pls.\u2019 Br. at 18, 20, \nignores that the alleged transfer (i) originated from a \nSwedish bank, (ii) was cleared through Bank of New \nYork, and (iii) was earmarked for \u201cHELP CONCERNING \nORPHAN CHILDREN.\u201d Compl. Ex. D; Brown Decl. Ex. \n1. Plaintiffs proffer no facts explaining why BLOM should \nhave assigned a nefarious meaning to that statement, \nespecially since they concede that Sanabil did distribute \ncash to orphans in refugee camps in Lebanon. Pls.\u2019 Br. at \n20\u201321; Compl. \u00b6\u00a0611. None of these allegations, taken alone \nor collectively, can show that BLOM knowingly provided \nsubstantial assistance to Hamas\u2019s violent activities before \nthe Attacks.\nB.\t The Facts in Halberstam Are Not Analogous \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 efforts to analogize their case to the facts \nin Halberstam prove only how different the two cases \nare. In Halberstam, the court concluded Linda Hamilton \nknowingly provided substantial assistance to her live-\nin romantic partner\u2019s burglary enterprise. 705 F.2d at \n472. The finding that Hamilton possessed the required \nknowledge of the criminal enterprise was based on her \nknowledge of her partner\u2019s \u201cpattern of unaccompanied \nevening jaunts over five years, his boxes of booty\u201d kept in \ntheir shared basement, \u201cthe smelting of gold and silver\u201d \nin their shared home, \u201cthe sudden influx of great wealth\u201d \n\nAppendix H\n252a\nfrom which Hamilton directly benefited, \u201cthe filtering of all \ntransactions\u201d related to the sale of stolen goods \u201cthrough \nHamilton except the payout for [the acquisition of] goods,\u201d \nand \u201cHamilton\u2019s collusive and unsubstantiated treatment \nof income and deductions on her tax forms.\u201d Id. at 486 \n(emphasis in original). Based on those facts, the court \nconcluded that Hamilton provided \u201cinvaluable service to \nthe enterprise as banker, bookkeeper, recordkeeper, and \nsecretary,\u201d and that \u201c[s]he performed these services in \nan unusual way under unusual circumstances for a long \nperiod of time.\u201d Id. at 487.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations are nothing like the facts of \nHalberstam. Pls.\u2019 Br. 21\u201325. For example, Plaintiffs try \nto compare Hamilton\u2019s provision of assistance \u201cin an \nunusual way under unusual circumstances\u201d to BLOM\u2019s \nroutine processing of incoming bank transfers to the \nAlleged Account Holders (who were not then designated \nas SDGTs). Pls.\u2019 Br. at 22. But all the Complaint shows \nis that BLOM processed routine financial transactions \nfrom one organization it had no reason to believe was \naffiliated with Hamas to another organization it had no \nreason to believe was affiliated with Hamas. Plaintiffs\u2019 \nallegations are not like the unusual assistance allegations \nin Miller, in which the court found that Arab Bank was \nadministering an \u201cInsurance Scheme for individuals \nwhose cause of death included \u2018Martyr Operation.\u2019\u201d \n372 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 47. Elsewhere, Plaintiffs claim that \nBLOM\u2019s purported provision of financial services to the \nAlleged Account Holders was as \u201cintegral\u201d to HAMAS\u2019s \nterrorist operations as Hamilton\u2019s assistance to the \nburglary enterprise. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 24. But BLOM\u2019s degree \nof assistance\u2014processing wire transfers to organizations \n\nAppendix H\n253a\nit had no reason to think were involved in violent acts of \nterrorism (and which were not FTOs)\u2014does not remotely \napproach the type of assistance provided by Hamilton in \nHalberstam.\nIII. The Complaint\u2019s JASTA Claim Is Insufficient as a \nMatter of Law.\nTo survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint \nmust contain allegations sufficient to \u201cnudge[] their claims \nacross the line from conceivable to plausible,\u201d meaning \n\u201callegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent \nwith)\u201d satisfaction of JASTA\u2019s elements. Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007). Faced with a mountain \nof law showing that their Complaint falls short of this \nstandard, Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish those cases by \nurging that they were decided with the benefit of a full \nrecord or by claiming that fact disputes are for a jury to \nweigh. At one point, Plaintiffs even go so far as to imply \nthat a court may never resolve the substantial assistance \ninquiry as a matter of law, relying on a deceptively \nincomplete quote from Linde, from which Plaintiffs omit \nthe Court\u2019s explanation that the element could not be \nresolved \u201cfrom the record in th[at] case.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 23; \nLinde, 882 F.3d at 328.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 misdirection is transparent. Whether a case \nwas decided with the benefit of a full trial record does not \nalter the rule of law that emerges from the case. And, at \nthis stage, there are no disputes of fact. As it must, BLOM \nhas \u201cassum[ed] that all the allegations in the complaint are \ntrue (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nIf anything, this procedural posture should help Plaintiffs, \n\nAppendix H\n254a\nas BLOM cannot introduce evidence to rebut their \nallegations. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs impermissibly ask the \nCourt to overlook their inadequate allegations and let them \nfish for support in discovery. For example, Plaintiffs ask \nthe Court to forgive their failure to allege any connection \nbetween BLOM and Union of Good\u2014other than an account \nnumber untethered to transactions or time\u2014because they \nhave not yet had the \u201cbenefit of discovery.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 8 \nn.5. But that request rings particularly hollow given the \nComplaint\u2019s lists of transactions with the other Alleged \nAccount Holders, which presumably were drawn from the \ndiscovery Plaintiffs have already obtained in their many \nother ATA actions.\nIn reality, courts have not hesitated to dismiss JASTA \nclaims where, as here, plaintiffs have not met their \nburden to establish a plausible theory of liability. See, e.g., \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 17-cv-8709, 2019 \nWL 1409446, at * 10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2019) (granting \nmotion to dismiss JASTA claims); Siegel v. HSBC Bank \nUSA, N.A., No. 17-cv-6593, 2018 WL 3611967, at **4\u20135 \n(S.D.N.Y. July 27), appeal filed, No. 18-2540 (2d Cir. Aug. \n27, 2018) (same); see Weiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, 381 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 223, 238\u201339 (E.D.N.Y.) (concluding \nthat amending complaint to add JASTA claims would be \nfutile based on summary judgment standard), appeal \nfiled sub nom., Appelbaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 19-1159 (2d Cir. Apr. 16, 2019); Strauss v. Credit \nLyonnais, S.A., 379 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 148, 162 (E.D.N.Y.) (same), \nappeal filed, No. 19-1285 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2019).\nMoreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint stands in stark \ncontrast to the cases declining to dismiss JASTA \n\nAppendix H\n255a\nclaims. For instance, in Miller v. Arab Bank, PLC, the \nplaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank processed payments \nas part of an insurance scheme for families of \u201cmartyrs.\u201d \n372 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 47\u201348. And in Lelchook v. Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, this Court entered a default judgment \nagainst an unrepresented defendant where the complaint \nspecifically alleged that the financial accounts at issue \nwere \u201ccontrolled by Hezbollah.\u201d 2019 WL 2647998 at ** \n1, 6. No such allegations have been made in this case.\nIV.\tEven Setting Aside the Complaint\u2019s General Failure \nto Allege a JASTA Claim, Certain Individual \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claims Are Insufficient.\nNor has Plaintiffs\u2019 brief undermined the shortcomings \nin the allegations of the Steinherz plaintiffs or Matanya \nNathensen. Even if the Court were to credit Plaintiffs\u2019 \nimpermissible efforts to rely upon allegations not in the \nComplaint, Pls.\u2019 Br. at 29 n.15, Plaintiffs contend that the \nSteinherzes\u2019 injuries were sustained after the Attack, \nafter they believed they were safe, after they were on \ntheir way home, and because they saw a \u201ccrazed-looking \nman\u201d who is not alleged to have been an Attacker. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0468\u201370. Plaintiffs provide no authority explaining how \nsuch facts can satisfy the proximate cause requirement, \ninstead directing the Court to a case not involving an \nintervening actor or event, which occurred both physically \nand temporally close to the relevant accident. In re Farm \nFamily Cas. Ins. Co. (Trapani), 753 N.Y.S.2d 198, 200 (3d \nDep\u2019t 2003). With regard to Matanya Nathensen, because \nhe is not a United States citizen, he has standing to bring a \nclaim based only on the damages he sustained as a result of \nhis citizen daughter\u2019s tragic death and not other damages \n\nAppendix H\n256a\nhe may have sustained in the Attack. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0138\u201339 \n(describing Mr. Nathensen\u2019s physical injuries); see Miller, \n372 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 41; Morris v. Khadr, 415 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d \n1323, 1337\u201338 (D. Utah 2006).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons and for those stated in \nBLOM\u2019s opening memorandum of law, BLOM respectfully \nrequests that the Court dismiss the Complaint with \nprejudice.\nDated:\t New York, New York \nJuly 29, 2019\nDECHERT LLP\nBy:\t\n/s/                                                               \nLinda C.

Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, \n535 (2005) (quoting Ackermann v. United States, 340 \nU.S. 193, 199 (1950)).  This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, \n507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  \u201cThis very strict \ninterpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality \nof judgments is to be preserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. \nat 535 (cleaned up).  In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nmove to vacate the judgment so they could file an \namended complaint.  The District Court denied the \nmotion under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled standard.  \nBut the Second Circuit reversed, based on an \nunprecedented \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading \nprinciples\u201d when addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nreopen a judgment for the purpose of filing an \namended complaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, \nobtaining relief from a final judgment under Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 \n(2005).  And those circumstances must demonstrate \n\u201cthat the [moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, \n393 (1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday, and free, calculated, deliberate \nchoices are not to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. \nUnited States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).   \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese finality principles.  And they have uniformly \nrejected attempts by plaintiffs to avoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nstringent requirements by appealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberal amendment policy.  The two inquiries are \nentirely separate.  Accordingly, \u201cif a plaintiff seeks to \nreopen a case under Rule 60(b) in order to file an \namended complaint, she must satisfy one of the Rule \n60(b) grounds before a court may consider her motion \nto amend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it, \nadopting a contrary rule would have placed it \u201calone \nin the Nation in collapsing the Rule 60(b) standard \nwith the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. at 177. \nBut the Second Circuit has done just that\u2014in a \ncase where Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \n\n2 \n \non the complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss and appeal.  The District Court \ndismissed that complaint with prejudice.  The Second \nCircuit affirmed after full merits briefing, oral \nargument, and supplemental briefing.  And at no time \nduring those appellate proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, 18 months after the dismissal with \nprejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed on \nappeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nvacate the judgment so they could try again with an \namended complaint.  The District Court properly \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard to deny Respondents\u2019 motion.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit reversed.  Based on a newly crafted test \nadopted by a split panel in Mandala v. NTT Data, 88 \nF.4th 353 (2d Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied (2d Cir. \nFeb. 13, 2024), the Second Circuit held that the \nDistrict Court abused its discretion in failing to \u201cgive \n\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  In the Second Circuit\u2019s view, district courts are \n\u201crequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem\u201d when plaintiffs seek to reopen a \njudgment in order to file an amended complaint.  Id.   \nThat reasoning is untenable.  The Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test effectively rewrites the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, eviscerates the finality principles \nembodied in Rule 60(b), and contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents several times over.  It also squarely \nconflicts with every one of the eleven other Circuits \nthat have addressed this issue.  Those courts have \n\n3 \n \nunanimously held that Rule 15\u2019s general policy has no \nplace in the Rule 60(b)(6) analysis.  Indeed, over 40 \nyears ago, then-Judge Breyer explained that, absent \nextraordinary circumstances, the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure do not \u201callow plaintiffs to pursue a \ncase to judgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the \ncase by amending their complaint to take account of \nthe court\u2019s decision.\u201d  James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 \n(1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.). \nNot only is the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier test wrong, \nbut its decision threatens to unleash far-reaching \nconsequences in cases filed within that court\u2019s bounds.  \nAs Judge Sullivan noted in his Mandala dissent, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s novel balancing test \u201cwill erode the \nfinality of judgments throughout th[e] Circuit, \nsignificantly undermine the important purposes \nserved by Rule 60(b), and increase the workload of \nbusy district court judges who carry the heaviest \nburden in our system of civil justice.\u201d  Pet.App.192 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Worse still, the test will \nencourage litigants to wait to amend their complaint \nuntil after final judgment and appeals have run their \ncourse, as Respondents did here.  That wasteful course \nis at odds with the finality and efficiency principles \nthat animate the Federal Rules, which this Court\u2019s \nprecedents have long enforced. \nThe Court should thus grant certiorari to restore \nuniformity in the law, to reverse the Second Circuit\u2019s \nerror on this issue of exceptional importance, and to \npreserve the finality of judgments protected by Rule \n60(b)(6). \n\n4 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case is \nreported at 432 F. Supp. 3d 253 and is reproduced at \nPet.App.54-87.  The Second Circuit\u2019s opinion affirming \nthe district court\u2019s dismissal is reported at 6 F.4th 487 \nand is reproduced at Pet.App.20-53.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) provides \nthat \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or \nproceeding for . . . any other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading . . . with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave. \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired.  They \nare victims and the families of victims of a series of \nterrorist attacks carried out by Hamas between \nDecember 1, 2001, and August 19, 2003.  Complaint, \nHonickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-\n00008-KAM-SMG (E.D.N.Y. Jan 1, 2019), ECF No. 1.  \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks by providing routine financial \nservices to three customers (Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, \nand Union of Good; together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), \nwho Respondents allege are associated with Hamas.  \nAs Petitioner explained in the proceedings below, it \ncategorically abhors terrorism, has no connection to \nHamas, and is not legally or factually responsible for \nRespondents\u2019 injuries. \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333, as amended \nby the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act \n(\u201cJASTA\u201d), id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).  Under JASTA, a United \nStates national \u201cinjured in his or her person, property, \nor business by reason of an act of international \nterrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may \nsue therefore in any appropriate district court of the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for \nsecondary liability against \u201cany person who aids and \nabets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, \nor who conspires with the person who committed such \nan act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \n \n\n6 \n \nJASTA secondary liability requires \u201cthat the \ndefendant consciously and culpably \u2018participate[d]\u2019 in \na wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, \nInc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) (quoting \nNye & Nissen v. United States, 326 U.S. 613, 619 \n(1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further restricts secondary \nliability by requiring that the \u2018act of international \nterrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or authorized by\u2019 a \nforeign terrorist organization designated as such \u2018as of \nthe date on which such act of international terrorism \nwas committed, planned, or authorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 \n(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  \u201cThus, it is not \nenough . . . that a defendant have given substantial \nassistance to a transcendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate \nfrom and floating above all the actionable wrongs that \nconstitute it.  Rather, a defendant must have aided \nand abetted (by knowingly providing substantial \nassistance) another person in the commission of the \nactionable wrong\u2014here, an act of international \nterrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance \n(the \n\u2018general \nawareness\u2019 \nelement).\u201d  \nPet.App.33 (cleaned up); see also Twitter, 598 U.S. at \n486, 487, 503.  Accordingly, to state a claim, \nRespondents \nneeded \nto \nplausibly \nallege \nthat \nPetitioner was aware of a link between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time Petitioner provided \nservices to them.  But they failed to do so.  \n \n\n7 \n \nBefore moving to dismiss Respondents\u2019 complaint, \nPetitioner submitted a three-page letter summarizing \nthe grounds for its contemplated motion to dismiss, as \nrequired by the District Court\u2019s Individual Practices.  \nMot. for Pre-Motion Conference, Honickman, et al. v. \nBLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. May 8, 2019), ECF No. 20.  One of \nPetitioner\u2019s principal arguments was that the \ncomplaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element needed to state their JASTA claim.  \nId. at 2.  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks.  In response, Respondents \nchose not to amend; they instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  Mot. to Adjourn \nConference, Honickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, \nNo. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG (E.D.N.Y. June 5, \n2019), ECF No. 30.   \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.  Respondents\u2019 \nCounsel unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \n\n8 \n \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \nOrder memorializing the fact that the \u201cCourt offered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \ncomplaint to add additional information in response to \nthe arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nMinute Entry & Scheduling Order, Honickman, et al. \nv. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. May 15, 2019).  \nConsistent with its pre-motion letter, Petitioner \nmoved to dismiss, based on, among other things, the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to plausibly suggest that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 purported affiliation \nwith Hamas before the alleged attacks.  See, e.g., \nMemo. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, Honickman, et al. \nv. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. July 30, 2019), ECF No. 36-1 at 1, 8, 9, 18.  \nRespondents once again stood on their papers.  See \nMemo. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss, Honickman, et al. \nv. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. July 30, 2019), ECF No. 37 at 18.  They did \nnot move to amend or ask for an opportunity to replead \nshould the District Court find their allegations \nlacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the U.S. government to have provided \n\n9 \n \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this point, asking \u201c[w]here do you allege in your \ncomplaint that BLOM Bank knew that these account \nholders are alter egos or are a part of, or the same as \n[Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District Court then \noffered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another opportunity \nto amend the complaint, specifically with respect to \nPetitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: So everything I need to consider \nin terms of sufficiency of your pleading is \ngoing to be found in the complaint that\u2019s \nfiled in this case, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the \ncontentions of the defendants regarding \nknowledge, especially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, \nbut \nthe\u2014we \nbelieve \nthe \ncomplaint goes far enough in saying that \nBLOM . . . was generally aware of its role in \nth[e] [il]licit conduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding that Respondents had not \u201cplausibly \nallege[d] that BLOM was generally aware of any \nconnection between the Three Customers and Hamas\u201d \n\u201cat the time it provided financial services to the Three \nCustomers.\u201d  Pet.App.73.   \n\n10 \n \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, here, \nRespondents \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and \nspecifically declined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  \nAccordingly, \u201c[i]n light of [Respondents\u2019] rejection of \nthe opportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-\nmotion conference, and the fact that they ha[d] not \nidentified any additional facts they could allege which \nwould address the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal To The Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend, Respondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Instead, they doubled down on their \nargument that their existing allegations were \nsufficient.  After oral argument, the Second Circuit \nheld the appeal in abeyance pending its decision in \nKaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d \n842 (2d Cir. 2021).  Then, after issuing the Kaplan \ndecision\u2014which clarified that Circuit\u2019s view of \nJASTA\u2019s elements\u2014the Second Circuit ordered the \nparties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the \nsignificance of that decision.  Arg. Notice, Honickman, \net al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 20-575 (2d Cir. Nov. 10, \n2020), Dkt. No. 90.  At this point, Respondents had yet \nanother opportunity to ask for a remand and leave to \namend in light of Kaplan.  Once again, they did \nneither and instead relied on the allegations in their \n\n11 \n \ncomplaint to argue that those allegations state a \nclaim.  See generally Appellants\u2019 Post-Arg. Br., \nHonickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 20-575 (2d \nCir. July 9, 2021), Dkt. No. 98, at 1-16. \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that BLOM Bank was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing or even belatedly request that the \nSecond Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents then returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment so they could amend their complaint.  Mot. \nfor Pre-Mot. Conference to Vacate Judgment & Amend \nCompl., Honickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. \n1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2021), \nECF No. 50.  The District Court held a pre-motion \nconference, and then ordered briefing \u201conly as to the \nissue of vacatur.\u201d  Scheduling Order, Honickman, et \nal. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2021).  After briefing, the District \nCourt held that \u201cplaintiffs have not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also held that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.16. \n\n12 \n \nRespondents appealed again.  After oral argument \nin that appeal, the Second Circuit issued its decision \nin Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d Cir. \n2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied (2d Cir. Feb. 13, 2024).  See \nPet.App.161-92.  There, a split panel held that, when \na losing party seeks post-judgment relief under Rule \n60(b)(6) to amend its complaint, the district court \nmust balance Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with \nRule \n15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal \namendment \npolicy.\u201d  \nPet.App.176.  And, where a losing party has not yet \nfiled an amended complaint, the Second Circuit held \nthat it is an abuse of discretion for a district court to \ndeny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Pet.App.17 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s rule \u201cundermines the principle that Rule \n60(b)(6) affords litigants an extraordinary remedy and \neffectively holds that such relief is available in the \nordinary course.\u201d  Pet.App.190. \nIn this case, the Second Circuit reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s rule.  It held that \u201cthe district court \nexceeded its discretion by basing its ruling on an \nerroneous view of the law because it failed to balance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  \u201c[W]hen presented \nwith a motion to vacate and amend,\u201d the Second \nCircuit explained, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, applying Mandala, the \n\n13 \n \nSecond Circuit faulted the District Court for analyzing \nthe Rule 60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nstandard.\u201d  Id. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nstringent \nstandard \nconflicts \nwith \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nprecedents and decisions from eleven other Circuits.  \nIt also opens a dangerous loophole threatening to \nundermine the finality of judgments in the federal \ncourts.  Rather than allow this problematic circuit \nsplit to persist, this Court should grant certiorari and \nswiftly reverse. \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Rule Conflicts With \nThe Decisions Of Eleven Other Circuits. \nThis Court has long recognized the compelling \ninterest in protecting the finality of judgments under \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Consistent with \nthose principles, Rule 60(b)(6) presents unsuccessful \nlitigants with only \u201cnarrow grounds for obtaining post-\njudgment relief.\u201d  Leisure Caviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & \nWildlife Serv., 616 F.3d 612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010) \n(Sutton, J.).  Rule 60(b)(6) may be used to reopen a \njudgment only when the movant demonstrates \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at \n535.  But in the Second Circuit\u2019s view, the \u201cliberal \nspirit of Rule 15(a)\u201d generally entitles litigants whose \ncomplaints have been dismissed with prejudice a \nchance to vacate the dismissal under Rule 60(b)(6) to \namend\u2014even after the judgment has been affirmed on \nappeal.  Pet.App.175.  This view places the Second \nCircuit alone among the Circuits.  The First, Third, \nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits have taken the opposite \n\n14 \n \napproach.  And the Second Circuit has already refused \nto reconsider its rule en banc.  Thus, only this Court \ncan restore uniformity on this important question. \nThe circuit split here could not be more clear.  In \nfact, when considering the issue at the same time as \nthe Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit observed that \nadopting the Second Circuit\u2019s approach would have \nput it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule 60(b) \nstandard \nwith \nthe \nstandard \nfor \nRule \n15(a).\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  The Fourth Circuit \nacknowledged that dicta from one of its previous \ndecisions could be misunderstood as endorsing the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s mistaken view.  But, in Daulatzai, \nthe Fourth Circuit emphatically rejected that \napproach.  Id.  Instead, the Fourth Circuit held that \nthe \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for granting a Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before consideration \ncan be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 \n(emphasis added).  There is no way to square that rule \nwith the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule that district \ncourts are \u201crequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and \nRule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe Sixth Circuit has likewise rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach.  It has held that, in this situation, \n\u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the modest requirements of \nRule 15, [a plaintiff] must meet the requirements for \nreopening a case established by Rule [60].\u201d  Moreland \nv. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 327 (6th Cir. 2016) (citation \nomitted).  And it has appropriately treated the Rule 60 \nand Rule 15 requirements as distinct hurdles.  See id.  \nThat is, plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \n\n15 \n \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  Otherwise, \nas Judge Sutton has explained, plaintiffs could \n\u201csidestep the narrow grounds for obtaining post-\njudgment relief\u201d under Rule 60, \u201cmake the finality of \njudgments an interim concept,\u201d and risk turning Rule \n60 into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616. \nThe Third Circuit has also rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach.  Instead, the Third Circuit has \nheld that, when a plaintiff seeks to \u201creopen a final \njudgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring the finality of \njudgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, \n86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  Indeed, the Third \nCircuit has repeatedly applied those principles to deny \npost-judgment relief in cases like this one.  For \ninstance, in Dominos Pizza LLC v. Deak, 534 F. App\u2019x \n171 (3d Cir. 2013), the district court dismissed a \ndefendant\u2019s amended counterclaim without prejudice \nbut the defendant\u2014like the Respondents here\u2014made \nthe deliberate decision not to file a second amended \ncounterclaim.  Id. at 173.  The defendant instead \nappealed to the Third Circuit, where he lost.  Id.   \nAfter failing on appeal, the Deak defendant moved \nunder Rules 15(a) and 60(b)(6) to reopen proceedings \nso he could amend his counterclaim.  Id. at 173-74.  \nBut the district court denied that request because the \ndefendant \u201chad ample opportunity to attempt to \nreassert his counterclaim . . . while the case was open, \nbut he failed to do so.\u201d  Id.  The Third Circuit affirmed, \nholding that \u201ccourts must deny relief under Rule \n\n16 \n \n60(b)(6) unless extraordinary circumstances are \npresent,\u201d \nwhile \nemphasizing \nthat \n\u201cthe \nliberal \nstandards \nof \nRule \n15\u201d \ndo \nnot \n\u201cdemonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances justifying relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 174.  The court also agreed that \nthe plaintiff had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to amend his \ncomplaint but \u201cdid not move to do so until after the \ncase was closed,\u201d and suggested that it was the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cdeliberate choices\u201d that resulted in the \nclosing of the case.  Id. at 174, 175.  The Third Circuit \nthus applied \u201cthe framework of Rule 60(b)(6)\u201d to deny \npost-judgment relief.  Id. at 174; see also Atkinson v. \nMiddlesex Cnty., 610 F. App\u2019x 109, 112 n.6 (3d Cir. \n2015).  That case would have come out the other way \nunder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach. \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently rejected the \napproach taken by the Second Circuit.  In MacPhee v. \nMiMedx Group, Inc., 73 F.4th 1220 (11th Cir. 2023), \nthat court held that applying Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s standard \nis \u201cinappropriate . . . [if] dismissal of the complaint \nalso constitutes dismissal of the action.\u201d  Id. at 1249-\n50 (citation omitted).  That is because Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \nan extraordinary remedy and requires a showing of \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 to justify the reopening \nof a final judgment.\u201d  Id. at 1251.  And the court \nexplicitly clarified that this held true even for \u201cpost-\njudgment motions to amend where the plaintiff has \nnot exercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as \na matter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250; see also Caterpillar \nFin. Servs. Corp. v. Venequip Mach. Sales Corp., 2023 \nWL 8258886, at *1-2, 4 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 29, 2023) \n(applying MacPhee and refusing to allow post-\njudgment amendment \u201cbased on [plaintiff\u2019s] good faith \nbelief that it had advanced an actionable complaint\u201d).  \n\n17 \n \nThe D.C. Circuit has long concluded that \u201cRule \n60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for unsuccessful \nlitigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. Gates, 481 \nF.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  In Building Industrial \nAssociation of Superior California v. Norton, that \ncourt \nreasoned \nthat \n\u201c[o]rdinarily \npostjudgment \namendment of a complaint under Rule 15(a) requires \nreopening of the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) or \n60(b).\u201d  247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) \n(Silberman, J.).  And it explained that this approach \n\u201cprevents litigants from resurrecting claims on which \nthey have lost.\u201d  Id.; see also Black Lives Matter D.C. \nv. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2024 WL 1091730, at *6-\n7 (D.D.C. Mar. 13, 2024) (Friedrich, J.). \nThe Ninth Circuit agrees, too.  In Lindauer v. \nRogers, 91 F.3d 1355 (9th Cir. 1996), that court \n\u201cadopt[ed] the requirement that, once judgment has \nbeen entered in a case, a motion to amend the \ncomplaint can only be entertained if the judgment is \nfirst reopened under a motion brought under Rule 59 \nor 60.\u201d  Id. at 1357.  That is because, \u201c[i]n contrast to \nthe \u2018freely give[n] dispensation to amend in Rule 15, \nRule 60(b) relief should be granted \u2018sparingly\u2019 to avoid \n\u2018manifest injustice\u2019 and \u2018only where extraordinary \ncircumstances prevented a party from taking timely \naction to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.\u2019\u201d \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting United States v. Alpine \nLand & Reservoir Co., 984 F.2d 1047, 1049 (9th Cir. \n1993)).  Recently in 3WL, LLC v. Master Protection, \nLP, 851 F. App\u2019x 4 (9th Cir. 2021), the Ninth Circuit \napplied that rule to conclude that a \u201cdistrict court \nproperly denied [a] motion\u201d to vacate the judgment \nwhere the movant had \u201cpaid only lip service to this \n\n18 \n \nimportant distinction\u201d between Rule 60 and Rule 15.  \nId. at 8.  Because the movant had not satisfied Rule \n60, \u201cthere was no basis to reach the Rule 15 issue.\u201d  Id.; \nsee also In re Netflix, Inc. Secs. Litig, 647 F. App\u2019x 813, \n816 (9th Cir. 2016) (\u201c[B]ecause Plaintiffs have not \ncleared the high bar necessary to warrant relief under \nRule[] 59 or Rule 60, the district court had no need to \neven consider Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 15 motion.\u201d). \nOther Circuits have reached similar conclusions.  \nThe Seventh Circuit has held that \u201cthe relative merits \nof [a] Rule 15(a) motion will not affect the judge\u2019s \ndecision with regard to [a] Rule [60(b)] motion.\u201d  Helm \nv. Resol. Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. 1996).  \nThe Tenth Circuit has concluded that a post-judgment \nmotion to amend under Rule 15(a) \u201cwould not be \nallowed until the judgment was set aside or vacated \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 or 60.\u201d  Cooper v. \nShumway, 780 F.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per \ncuriam).  The Eighth Circuit has also recently stressed \nthat leave to amend may be granted only if \u201cconsistent \nwith the stringent standards governing the grant of \nRule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  UMB Bank, N.A. v. \nGuerin, 89 F.4th 1047, 1057 (8th Cir. 2024) (citation \nomitted).  The Fifth Circuit has held that \u201c[w]hen a \ndistrict court dismisses an action and enters a final \njudgment . . . a plaintiff may request leave to amend \nonly by either appealing the judgment, or seeking to \nalter or reopen the judgment under Rule 59 or 60.\u201d  \nRosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. \n2003); see also Briddle v. Scott, 63 F.3d 364, 379-80 \n(5th Cir. 1995).   And the First Circuit has long refused \nto \u201callow plaintiffs to pursue a case to judgment and \nthen, if they lose, to reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d  \n\n19 \n \nJames v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, \nJ.).  As then-Judge Breyer explained, permitting \n\u201c[s]uch a practice would dramatically undermine the \nordinary rules governing the finality of judicial \ndecisions.\u201d  Id.; see also Fisher v. Kadant, Inc., 589 \nF.3d 505, 509, 512-14 (1st Cir. 2009). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s decision cannot be reconciled \nwith this wall of contrary precedents from the other \nCircuits.1  And, by denying en banc review in Mandala \nand applying the rule in this case, that court has left \nno doubt that the circuit split will persist absent this \nCourt\u2019s immediate intervention and correction.  \nPet.App.193-94. \nII. The Second Circuit\u2019s Rule Conflicts With \nThis Court\u2019s Precedents. \nNot only does the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nconflict with the decisions of other Circuits, but it is at \nodds with over a century of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence \nprotecting the finality of judgments.   \nIn 1897, this Court explained that \u201cthe aid of \njudicial tribunals would not be invoked for the \nvindication of rights of persons and property, if . . . \nconclusiveness did not attend the judgments of such \ntribunals.\u201d  S. Pac. R.R. v. United States, 168 U.S. 1, \n49 (1897).  In the 127 years since, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that finality of judgments is \ncritical to any effective and orderly judicial system.  \nSee, e.g., Yeager v. United States, 557 U.S. 110, 118 \n \n1 Because the Federal Circuit \u201capplies the law of the respective \nregional circuit on questions of procedure,\u201d Gen. Protecht Trp., \nInc. v. Leviton Mfg. Co., 651 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s view conflicts with all other Circuits. \n\n20 \n \n(2009) (reiterating \u201cinterest [in] the preservation of \n\u2018the finality of judgments.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, \n437 U.S. 28, 33 (1978)); United States v. Denedo, 556 \nU.S. 904, 916 (2009) (\u201c[J]udgment finality is not to be \nlightly cast aside.\u201d). \nThat respect for finality applies with particular \nforce when evaluating motions for relief from \njudgments under Rule 60.  \u201cThere must be an end to \nlitigation someday, and free, calculated, deliberate \nchoices\u201d that result in a final judgment are thus \u201cnot \nto be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  \nBecause Rule 60(b)(6) is a catchall for relief on bases \nother than those in Rule 60(b)(1)-(5), \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  Kemp v. \nUnited States, 596 U.S. 528, 533 (2022) (quoting \nLiljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. \n847, 863 n.11 (1988) (cleaned up)).  This Court has \nemphasized that principle time and again.  See, e.g., \nTharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018); Buck v. \nDavis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393; Liljeberg, 486 U.S. 863 & n.11; \nKlapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 613\u201314 \n(1949).  And this Court has left no room for Rule 15\u2019s \nliberal amendment policy to creep into that equation.  \nFor good reason:  The \u201cdrafters of the rules included \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) specifically to provide a \nmechanism for those situations in which relief must \nbe obtained after judgment and the broad amendment \npolicy of Rule 15(a) should not be construed in a \nmanner \nthat \nwould \nrender \nthose \nprovisions \nmeaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. \nCiv. \u00a7 1489 (3d ed.).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable \nthe liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be \nemployed in a way that is contrary to the philosophy \n\n21 \n \nfavoring finality of judgments and the expeditious \ntermination of litigation.\u201d  Id. \nIn addition, this Court has likewise stressed that, \nto \nqualify \nfor \nrelief, \nthe \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019\u201d must \u201csuggest[] that the party is \nfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at \n393 (citation omitted).  Parties \u201ccannot be relieved of \n[their] choice[s]\u201d simply \u201cbecause hindsight seems to \nindicate\u201d \nthe \nimprovidence \nof \nsuch \ndecisions.  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198; see also 11 Wright & \nMiller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2857 (3d ed.) (\u201cThe \ncases show that although the courts have sought to \naccomplish justice, they have administered Rule 60(b) \nwith a scrupulous regard for the aims of finality.\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s novel approach is squarely at \nodds with this Court\u2019s decisions.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15\u2019s liberality policy \u201cin \ntandem\u201d with Rule 60\u2019s finality principles\u2014even when \na movant has rejected numerous opportunities to \namend before final judgment (and during appeal)\u2014the \nSecond Circuit is instructing district courts to relieve \nmovants of their \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices.\u201d  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  That is precisely the sort \nof unfair and inefficient feedback loop that this Court \nhas repeatedly warned against.  This Court should \ngrant certiorari to confirm the importance of the \nfinality of judgments and restore the universal rule \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) relief may not be used as a do-over \nto remedy poor litigation decisions. \n\n22 \n \nIII. The Question Presented Is Exceptionally \nImportant, And This Case Is A Clean Vehicle \nFor Resolving It.  \nThe question presented is of critical importance to \nthe principles of fairness, efficiency, and finality that \nanimate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The \nmajority approach rightly requires plaintiffs to put \ntheir best complaint forward before judgment\u2014or risk \nan end to their lawsuit.  That emphasis on finality \n\u201cincreases the efficiency of the judicial system\u201d and \n\u201cincreases the integrity of the system by maintaining \nrespect for the judicial process.\u201d  Jill E. Fisch, \nRewriting History: The Propriety of Eradicating Prior \nDecisional Law Through Settlement and Vacatur, 76 \nCornell L. Rev. 589, 591 (1991).  It also furthers the \nguiding principle of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure\u2014\u201cto \nsecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s standard flips those deeply \nrooted tenets on their head.  It eschews finality and \nundermines confidence in the outcome of litigation.  \nPlaintiffs in the Second Circuit can now \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decisions,\u201d \neven after testing the complaint against a full appeal \nand after repeatedly declining earlier opportunities to \namend.  Leisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (cleaned up).  \nSuch gamesmanship will inevitably draw out \nlitigation and waste scarce judicial resources.  See \nPet.App.192 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  That is why \ncourts have long rejected such belated attempts at \n\n23 \n \namendment and reserved Rule 60(b)(6) relief for only \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances.\u201d  Watt, 716 F.2d at \n78 (Breyer, J.). \nIt is thus essential for this Court to clarify the legal \nframework that governs a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nseeking to reboot a case with a post-judgment (and \npost-appeal) amendment to the complaint.  As it \nstands now, litigants in all but three States are held \nto Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard when seeking post-\njudgment relief.  Litigants within the Second Circuit, \nhowever, face a dramatically lower burden. The \nfinality of a judgment should not change based on the \nmere happenstance of geography. \nMoreover, the volume and significance of cases \nfiled within the Second Circuit exacerbates that threat \nto orderly and efficient litigation.  That is because \n\u201c[t]he Second Circuit\u2014surely owing to its location in \nmajor business centers\u2014sees a greater percentage of \nprivate civil cases than any of its sister circuits.\u201d  \nMerritt E. McAlister, Rebuilding the Federal Circuit \nCourts, 116 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1137, 1184 (2022).   \nOne prime example is the universe of lawsuits \ninvoking the ATA and JASTA.  Based on Petitioner\u2019s \nresearch, there appear to be 90 civil actions that have \nasserted claims under the ATA, and 55 of them have \nbeen filed in district courts in the Second Circuit.  Of \nnote, the law firm representing plaintiffs in this case \nis responsible for at least 17 of those cases\u2014nearly \n19%.2  ATA complaints frequently run hundreds of \n \n2 Tellingly, in many of the other ATA cases brought by \nRespondents\u2019 counsel, they have filed amended complaints in the \nordinary course of litigation.  See, e.g., Bonacasa v. Standard \nChartered PLC, Case No. 1:22-cv-03320-ER, ECF No. 65 \n\n24 \n \npages, with some nearing 1,000 pages.  See, e.g., \nBartlett v.

In the Bartlett litigation cited above, \nwhere BLOM Bank is a defendant and where Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel represents the plaintiffs, there have been three amended \ncomplaints. \n\n25 \n \nATA cases are no isolated example.  The volume \nand complexity of cases within the Second Circuit cuts \nacross all areas of civil litigation.  For instance, as of \n2018, \u201c[s]tudies indicate that the highest volume of \nsecurities cases filed in the United States is recorded \nin the\u201d Southern District of New York.  Victor \nMarrero, Mission to Dismiss: A Dismissal of Rule \n12(b)(6) and the Retirement of Twombly/Iqbal, 40 \nCardozo L.

Pol\u2019y 365, 393 n.166 (2018) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Second Circuit saw more than 1.5x the \namount of securities class actions filings than the next \nhighest circuit in 2017\u201d).  In the wake of the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, a majority of related class actions were \nfiled in the Second Circuit.  Denise Mazzeo, Note, \nSecurities Class Actions, CAFA, and a Countrywide \nCrisis: A Call For Clarity and Consistency, 78 \nFordham L. Rev. 1433, 1461 & n.216 (2009); Shrey \nSharma, Note, Do the Second Circuit\u2019s Legal \nStandards on Class Certification Incentivize Forum \nShopping?: A Comparative Analysis of the Second \nCircuit\u2019s \nClass \nCertification \nJurisprudence, \n85 \nFordham L. Rev. 877, 883 n.43 (2016) (\u201c[T]he Second \nCircuit naturally may see more securities filings \nbecause it encompasses all of New York City.\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also attracts a significant \namount of antitrust lawsuits.  See Bernadette Berger, \nComment, Shut Up and Pitch: Major League \nBaseball\u2019s Power Struggle With Minor League Players \nin Senne v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp., 28 \nJeffrey S. Moorad Sports L.J. 53, 83 (2021).  These \n\n26 \n \nsorts of complex lawsuits are notoriously expensive as \nit stands.  See, e.g., Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 558-59 (2007).  The Second Circuit\u2019s ill-\nconsidered rule promises to multiply that expense and \nthe related burden on judicial resources. \nFinally, this case is a good vehicle to decide this \nstraightforward and significant legal question.  There \nis no doubt that the issue is both clearly presented and \ncase-dispositive here.  Although the decision below \nwas unpublished, it followed closely behind the \npublished Second Circuit decision that controlled the \noutcome\u2014which demonstrates that the issue is \nrecurring and confirms that the Second Circuit stands \nout of step with this Court\u2019s precedents and the \nuniform view of the other Circuits.3   \nUltimately, this case turns on a clear, case-\ndispositive issue that is now subject to a lopsided \ncircuit split.  Had the Second Circuit followed the \nFirst, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits, then \nPetitioner would have prevailed below.  And the facts \nhere\u2014where Respondents repeatedly declined to \namend their complaint in the normal course\u2014only \nplace the issue in stark relief.  This Court should thus \ngrant certiorari and reverse, in order to restore \nuniformity on this important issue. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari. \n \n3 In Mandala, the Second Circuit denied the defendant\u2019s request \nfor rehearing or rehearing en banc.

Respondents do not seriously \ndispute that the Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule \n60(b)\u2019s stringent standard places it on the short end of \na lopsided circuit split.  In fact, Respondents entirely \nignore the conflicting decisions of several Courts of \nAppeals.  And they get no further with their efforts to \ndistinguish a few bricks in the wall of precedents from \nevery other Circuit that has rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier approach.  Those decisions make clear \nthat the Second Circuit is now \u201calone in the Nation in \ncollapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard \nfor Rule 15(a).\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, \n177 (4th Cir. 2024). \nRespondents similarly do not dispute that, \u201c[t]o \njustify relief under [Rule 60(b)(6)], a party must show \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 suggesting that the \nparty is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  Nor do \nthey dispute that, in this case, their repeated decisions \nnot to amend were \u201cfree, calculated, [and] deliberate.\u201d  \nAckermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).  \nThat should foreclose the extraordinary relief \nRespondents seek here.  \nInstead, Respondents\u2019 primary response is to fault \nthe Petition for not discussing Foman v. Davis, 371 \nU.S. 178 (1962).  But there is a very good reason for \nthat:  Foman involved a Rule 59(e) motion, while this \ncase concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  Indeed, \n\n2 \nthis Court recently emphasized that very point in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), when it refused \nto conflate the two Rules in the habeas context.  Thus, \nFoman\u2019s discussion of Rule 59(e) does not affect the \nRule 60(b)(6) analysis here.   \nInstead, the relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s decisions squarely conflict with Gonzalez by \neschewing Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent rule in favor of a \n\u201cliberal repleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  No other \nCircuit has adopted that misguided approach.   \nUnable to wash away the circuit split or the Second \nCircuit\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedent, \nRespondents try to ward off review by labeling this \ncase \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d  But that is patently incorrect.  \nThis appeal arises from Respondents\u2019 attempt to \nvacate a final judgment that was entered nearly five \nyears ago.  And the ruling denying that motion was \nitself a final order.  Relief from this Court would thus \nfinally end this case, while denying review would \nthwart the efficiency and finality principles that \nanimate the Federal Rules. \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s unprecedented \ndilution of Rule 60(b)(6) conflicts with this Court\u2019s \ndecisions and those of every other Circuit.  It threatens \nto undermine the finality of judgments.  It encourages \nwasteful litigation tactics.  And, as a matter of law, the \ndecision below is simply wrong.  This Court should \ngrant review and reverse.   \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Approach Conflicts \nWith That Of Eleven Other Circuits.  \nRespondents concede the existence of a circuit split \nby failing to address the conflicting decisions \nPetitioner identified from the First, Third, Eighth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Although Respondents \ncherry-pick quotes from some of the others, a review \nof those decisions confirms an irreconcilable split \nbetween the Second Circuit\u2019s newly developed test for \nRule 60(b) motions and the correct test used in the rest \nof the Courts of Appeals. \nA. Respondents Concede that a Circuit Split \nExists.   \nRespondents \ncompletely \nignore \nthen-Judge \nBreyer\u2019s decision for the First Circuit in James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71 (1983).  There, as here, the First \nCircuit confronted a district court\u2019s denial of a post-\njudgment motion to amend a dismissed complaint.  Id. \nat 77.  In affirming, then-Judge Breyer explained that \n\u201cto require the district court to permit amendment \nhere would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to \njudgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the case by \namending their complaint to take account of the \ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 78.  The First Circuit rebuked \nthat approach because it \u201cwould dramatically \nundermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of \njudicial decisions.\u201d  Id.  That reasoning flatly \ncontradicts the \u201cliberal amendment policy\u201d endorsed \nby the Second Circuit.  Pet.App.7.  But Respondents \ndo not even acknowledge the case. \n\n4 \nRespondents also ignore the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d \nCir. 2019).  In Garrett, the Third Circuit explained \nthat, when a party seeks \u201cto reopen a final judgment, \nthe policy favoring the finality of judgments\u201d is \nimplicated, and \u201c[t]he permissive policy favoring \namendment under Rule 15 [is] simply not relevant.\u201d  \nId. at 86.  Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the post-judgment context, \nthe narrow grounds for relief set forth\u201d in Rule 60(b) \n\u201cmust guide a District Court\u2019s decision about whether \nan otherwise-final judgment should  be disturbed.\u201d  Id.\nThe Third Circuit therefore recognizes\u2014unlike the \nSecond Circuit\u2014that \u201ca different set of rules \nemphasizing vastly different policies\u201d pertain to a \nmotion seeking to vacate a final judgment for the \npurposes of amending a complaint.  Id.\nRespondents likewise ignore the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in MacPhee v. MiMedx Grp., Inc., 73 F.4th \n1220 (11th Cir. 2023).  As in this case, the district \ncourt there denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for post-\njudgment vacatur-for-amendment, \u201cexplaining that \nbecause [the plaintiff] waited until after judgment was \nentered to seek such relief, Rule 15(a) did not apply.\u201d  \nId. at 1238.  Unless the plaintiff could first show \n\u201centitle[ment] to relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d it \n\u201cwas not entitled to leave to amend post-judgment.\u201d  \nId.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, embracing this \nrestrictive approach even \u201cwhere the plaintiff has not \nexercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as a \nmatter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250.  Again, that is directly \nat odds with the Second Circuit\u2019s belief that plaintiffs \nneed not \u201cnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before \nthey [can] invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading \n\n5 \npolicy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And, again, Respondents \nconspicuously fail to address it.  \nThe same goes for UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 \nF.4th 1047 (8th Cir. 2024).  As the Eighth Circuit held \nthere, \u201cthe liberal amendment standard in Rule \n15(a)(2) does not govern\u201d for post-judgment motions \nseeking to amend a complaint.  Id. at 1057. Instead, \n\u201ca more restrictive standard reflecting interests of \nfinality applies.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  That is, \n\u201c[l]eave to amend will be granted if\u201d\u2014and only if\u2014\u201cit \nis consistent with the stringent standards governing \nthe grant of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  Id.\n(cleaned up).  Respondents once again ignore this \ndecision, which squarely conflicts with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement that district courts \u201cbalance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Mandala v. \nNTT Data, 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023).   \nRespondents similarly ignore the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for \nunsuccessful litigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. \nGates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To be sure, \nRespondents obliquely note that the D.C. Circuit has \nallowed \npost-judgment \namendment \nin \n\u201ccertain \ncircumstances.\u201d  BIO.27.  But those are where the \nmovant has \u201cprevailed on the claim in question.\u201d  Bldg. \nIndus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nRespondents\u2019 claims were dismissed with prejudice, \nand that dismissal was affirmed on appeal.  \n\n6 \nIn short, by their own omissions, Respondents \nconcede the decision below conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. \nCircuits.  That alone should warrant review. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Discussion of Other Circuit \nDecisions \nConfirms \nthat \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit Has Adopted an Outlier Approach. \nThe circuit split extends far beyond the cases \nRespondents ignore.   \nMost notably, in Daulatzai, the Fourth Circuit \nspecifically rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in a \nthoroughly reasoned opinion.   See 97 F.4th at 180.  \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial \nof a Rule 60(b) motion.  In so doing, the Fourth Circuit \nconfronted the exact error that the Second Circuit \ncommitted in Mandala and this case.  It expressly \n\u201creject[ed] \nDaulatzai\u2019s \nargument\u201d \nthat \nearlier \nprecedents \u201ccollapsing . . . the standards under Rule \n59(e) and Rule 15(a) should also apply when the \nmotion seeks relief from the judgment under Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphases added).  Thus, unlike the \nSecond Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has correctly held \nthat, \u201cwhen the motion to vacate is filed under Rule \n60(b), the more restrictive standard for granting that \nmotion must be satisfied before consideration can be \ngiven to the motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphasis \nadded).  By contrast, the Second Circuit here faulted \nthe District Court for \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \nvacate and amend as calling for two distinct analyses\u201d \nunder Rule 60(b) and then Rule 15(a).  Pet.App.7-8; see \n\n7 \nalso Mandala 88 F.4th at 361.  The two approaches \nare impossible to square.1\nRespondents only further underscore this error by \ntrying to leverage a pair of Second Circuit decisions \naddressing Rule 59(e) to suggest its approach is \nconsistent with the law of other Circuits.  See BIO.21-\n23 (discussing Metzler Investment Gmbh v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2020) and \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam)).  But whether those earlier cases are \nconsistent with other Circuits\u2019 Rule 59(e) cases does \nnot alter the fact that the Second Circuit\u2019s treatment \nof Rule 60(b) motions seeking to replead sharply \nconflicts with the decisions of every other Circuit \napplying Rule 60(b).  On that latter issue, which is the \nquestion presented here, the Second Circuit has \nabandoned the extraordinary-circumstances standard \nto require district courts \u201cto consider Rule 60(b) \nfinality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  \nPet.App.7.  In other words, it has forbade district \ncourts from analyzing Rule 60(b) motions \u201cunder only \nRule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat clashes with the otherwise unanimous view of \nthe Courts of Appeals, which have consistently held \nthat plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \n1 Rather than confront the Fourth Circuit\u2019s thoughtful analysis \nin Daulatzai, Respondents suggest the Fourth Circuit must have \nbeen aware of the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in Mandala and \nHonickman.  BIO.23.  But the Second Circuit issued its mistaken \nopinions after Daulatzai was argued on October 24, 2023.  And \nthe docket in Daulatzai reflects that neither party filed a Rule \n28(j) letter bringing either Mandala or this case to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s attention.  It is thus no surprise that the Fourth Circuit \ndid not mention the Second Circuit\u2019s erroneous decisions. \n\n8 \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before\u201d \ninvoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  In re \nFerro Corp. Deriv. Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Ewing v. 1645 \nW. Farragut LLC, 90 F.4th 876, 893 (7th Cir. 2024); \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017); Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 \nF.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. 2003); Cooper v. Shumway, 780 \nF.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThis Court should thus grant certiorari to remedy \nthe split and confirm that losing litigants may not \ndeploy the policies of Rule 15(a) to bypass Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nexacting requirements for relief. \nII. Respondents\u2019 Reliance On Foman Only \nReinforces The Fundament Flaws In The \nSecond Circuit\u2019s Approach.  \nNot only are Respondents\u2019 efforts to obscure the \ncircuit split unavailing, but their attempt to defend \nthe \ndecision \nbelow \nonly \nfurther \nreveals \nthe \nfundamental legal error in the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier \napproach.  Respondents rely principally on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Foman, and they emphasize that \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s precedents have done the same.  \nBut Foman is categorically inapt, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s reliance on it was the very legal error that \ncaused it to split with every other Circuit and violate \nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents.   \nCritically, the Foman decision did not address a \nRule 60(b)(6) motion.  This court instead recognized \nthe motion \u201cas one under Rule 59(e).\u201d  371 U.S. at 181.  \nAs a result, Foman is simply irrelevant to this case.  \n\n9 \nRather, the controlling precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a Rule \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at 536.  Respondents and \nthe Second Circuit thus have the analysis backwards. \nIndeed, \nin \nBanister \nv. \nDavis, \nthis \nCourt \nemphasized the critical distinctions between Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b).  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-\ntime effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued \ndecision to a [district] court\u2019s attention, before taking \na single appeal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 521.  Accordingly, the \ntime for bringing a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis short\u201428 \ndays from entry of the judgment, with no possibility of \nan extension.\u201d  Id.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding,\u201d a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201c\u2018suspend[s] the finality\u2019 of any judgment.\u201d  Id. \nat 514 (cleaned up).  By contrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) \nmotion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always \ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already \ncompleted judgment.\u201d  Id. at 520-21.  Rather than \n\u201caid[ing] the trial court to get its decision right in the \nfirst instance,\u201d a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cserve[s] to \ncollaterally attack [an] already completed judgment.\u201d  \nId. at 518-19. It therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id.\nAnd for that reason, the \u201cstandard for granting a Rule \n59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d than \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  Daulatzai, 97 \nF.4th at 177.  In short, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule \n59(e) in just about every way that matters to the \ninquiry here.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 518; see \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177-78.   \n\n10 \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach fails to grasp these \ncrucial differences.  Instead, it wrongly treats Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions as fungible, and then \nrelies on Foman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard \nto override the strict requirements of Rule 60(b)(6) set \nforth in Gonzalez.  Thus, Respondents\u2019 effort to chide \nBLOM for not citing Foman only confirms that their \napproach\u2014which the Second Circuit adopted\u2014\nobliterates the critical distinction between Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b)(6).  No other Circuit has adopted that \ncategory error.  To the contrary, they have all rejected \nit.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in \nDaulatzai thoroughly debunks it.   \nMoreover, even if Foman somehow applied, the \nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion clearly \nsatisfied its requirements.  In Foman, this Court held \nonly that \u201coutright refusal to grant [plaintiffs] leave \n[to amend] without any justifying reason\u201d is an abuse \nof discretion.  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, the District Court \nprovided multiple reasons for its denial.  For starters, \nRespondents \u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all \nlegal avenues available to them for relief,\u201d yet they \nengaged in a \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe \ndeficiencies \nidentified \nin \ntheir \npleading.\u201d  \nPet.App.16; Pet.App.19.  In addition, the District \nCourt dismissed their complaint with prejudice, and \nthat decision was affirmed based on one of the grounds \nidentified by the District Court.  Pet.App.13; \nPet.App.15 n.3.  During the appeal, Respondents \nnever challenged the District Court\u2019s decision to \ndismiss with prejudice, and they never requested leave \nto \namend\u2014even \nduring \nsupplemental \nbriefing \nfollowing the Second Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in \nKaplan.  Pet.10-11.  And, even to the extent the \n\n11 \nSecond Circuit \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201d the law in its decision, the \nDistrict Court explained that \u201ca mere change in \ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nPet.App.14 (citation omitted); accord Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997) (\u201cIntervening \ndevelopments in the law by themselves rarely \nconstitute the extraordinary circumstances required \nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(6)[.]\u201d). \nIII. This \nCase \nDoes \nNot \nArise \nIn \nAn \nInterlocutory Posture. \nFaced with an undeniable circuit split and patently \nincorrect decision, Respondents attempt to label the \ndecision below \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to suggest that this case \npresents a \u201cpoor vehicle\u201d for review.  BIO.1; BIO.18-\n19; BIO.28.  But that is wrong as well.  Far from being \ninterlocutory, there is undeniably a final judgment in \nthis action.  See Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), aff\u2019d, 6 F.4th 487 (2d \nCir. 2021).  Indeed, this appeal exists only because \nRespondents have sought to vacate that final \njudgment.  Respondents also ignore that an order \ndenying a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cappealed as \u2018a \nseparate final order.\u2019\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 520 \n(quoting Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 401 (1995)).  And \nthey do not dispute that reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision would finally end this case for good.  There is \nthus nothing interlocutory about this appeal. \nWhat Respondents seem to really mean is that \nBLOM may still win yet again on remand.  On that \nbasis, Respondents suggest that review now may be \nunnecessary and inefficient.  BIO.18.  But that \nassertion is indicative of Respondents\u2019 abusive \n\n12 \nattitude toward the Federal Rules.  After Respondents \ndeclined multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint, BLOM secured dismissal with prejudice.  \nRather than move at that time to amend under Rule \n59(e), Respondents chose to appeal.  Even during \nsupplemental briefing on appeal, Respondents never \nasked the Second Circuit to remand so they could \nreplead.  And when the Second Circuit affirmed, \nRespondents did not seek rehearing.  Instead, they \nfiled a Rule 60(b)(6) motion that sought to start the \nprocess all over again\u2014on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts (of which they were \npreviously aware) in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  Applying this Court\u2019s standards under Rule \n60(b)(6), the District Court properly denied the \nmotion.  Had the Second Circuit similarly applied Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014or had this case arisen in any other \nCircuit\u2014this loop of relitigation would already be \nover.   \nRather than allow this inefficient distortion of the \nFederal Rules to continue, this Court should grant \nreview and restore uniformity in the law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in \nBLOM\u2019s Petition, certiorari should be granted. \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

The summary order \ndoes not even take a position on what the outcome of \nthe underlying motion to vacate should be\u2014it only di-\nrects the district court \u201cto reconsider Plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion\u201d in light of pre-existing Supreme Court and Sec-\nond Circuit precedents. Pet. App. 8. \nBLOM ignores each of these precedents but one\u2014a \ncase, unrelated to this one, called Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d Cir. 2023). BLOM is in fact \nseeking this Court\u2019s review of Mandala, which it erro-\nneously suggests permits plaintiffs to seek post-judg-\nment amendment under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal stand-\nards, purportedly \u201ceviscerat[ing] the finality princi-\nples embodied in Rule 60(b)\u201d and all but guaranteeing \ngamesmanship. Pet. 2. In reality, Mandala reaffirmed \nthat \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d 88 F.4th \nat 361. Mandala and this case are \u201camong the few that \njustifies relief from final judgment under 60(b)(6).\u201d Id. \nat 356.  \n This Court should decline Petitioner\u2019s request for \ninterlocutory review of the summary order below. \nEven if Mandala\u2019s recitation of the vacatur standards \nwas worth review (it is not), Honickman is a poor ve-\nhicle to do so\u2014the facts here are more extreme than \nthose in Mandala, and the grounds for vacatur there-\nfore much stronger.  \nHere, the district court applied the wrong stand-\nards in dismissing Respondents\u2019 (or \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nclaims under the Justice Against Sponsors of Terror-\nism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d). These erroneous standards were \nalso essentially impossible for Plaintiffs to meet on \namendment. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal, and the \nSecond Circuit \u201cagree[d] that the [district] court did \nnot apply the proper standard.\u201d Pet. App. 25. The cir-\ncuit set forth a clarified standard for pleading JASTA \nclaims, and only affirmed dismissal \u201con other \ngrounds,\u201d Pet. App. 10\u2014in fact, the circuit identified a \nsingle pleading deficiency that could be remedied on \namendment. Conversely, in Mandala the circuit \nagreed with the district court\u2019s reasoning, but thought \nthe deficiency the district court identified could be cor-\nrected with the right amendment. \nAs the circuit explained in the summary order be-\nlow, once \u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, \nPlaintiffs returned to the district court and moved un-\nder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) and \n15(a)(2) to vacate the judgment of dismissal and grant \nthem leave to file a first amended complaint.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 5. But the district court denied the motion, argu-\ning that Plaintiffs waived the chance to amend when \nthey declined its two prior invitations to amend \u201cin re-\nsponse to the arguments raised by Defendant,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16-17\u2014even though Plaintiffs correctly viewed \nthese \u201carguments\u201d as wrong (and unmeetable on \namendment). In the subsequent appeal, the circuit va-\ncated that denial and remanded for the district court \nto consider the motion again in light of prior prece-\ndents, including this Court\u2019s decision in Foman v. Da-\nvis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962), and Second Circuit precedent, \nincluding Mandala.  \nBLOM incorrectly argues that Mandala (and thus \nHonickman) conflicts with the cases BLOM has raised \nin its petition. They do not\u2014the precedents cited in \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nHonickman (and Mandala) balance Rule 60\u2019s finality \nwith this Court\u2019s rule that it is an \u201cabuse of \u2026 discre-\ntion\u201d to deny a post-judgment motion to amend \u201cwith-\nout any justifying reason,\u201d such as \u201cundue delay, bad \nfaith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments pre-\nviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party \nby virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility \nof amendment.\u201d Foman, 371 U.S. at 182. Notably, \nBLOM does not cite this \u201cseminal\u201d case once in its pe-\ntition. \nMoreover, none of the cases BLOM cites involve the \n\u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances at issue here, much less \nin Mandala. And despite BLOM\u2019s assurance that \ngamesmanship will surely follow, this case is clearly \nlimited to the scenario where a district court has de-\nnied a plaintiff a meaningful opportunity to amend, a \nclear inequity. This Court should deny certiorari. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019. \nThat complaint alleged that BLOM aided and abetted \na series of terrorist attacks committed by the Palestin-\nian terrorist group Hamas, injuring Plaintiffs. Specif-\nically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly pro-\nvided substantial assistance to three Hamas fronts \n(the \u201cThree Customers\u201d)\u2014principally the purported \ncharitable institution Sanabil, which the United \nStates designated a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Ter-\nrorist\u201d in 2003. BLOM assisted Sanabil in converting \ndonations from Hamas supporters abroad into cash, \nwhich Sanabil handed out to recruit Palestinians liv-\ning in Lebanon to join Hamas.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. A-188-91.1 \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the interpre-\ntive framework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s \nthen-only prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, \nPLC, 882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).   \nPlaintiffs responded on May 8, 2019, providing a \nsummary of their anticipated opposition. A-192-95. In \ntheir response, Plaintiffs argued that the scienter \nstandard from Halberstam governed their claims, not-\ning that foreseeability was the key factor in assessing \na defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct. As shown below, the \ncircuit ultimately vindicated this analysis. \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, A-199, it then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by the Second Circuit from the \nD.C. Circuit. [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel], do you want \nthat opportunity?  \n \n1 Citations to A-____ are to the joint appendix in the court of \nappeals. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nA-200-01. As Defendant\u2019s pre-motion letter makes \nclear, these Second and D.C. Circuit \u201cstandards\u201d re-\nferred to the Linde and Halberstam decisions, respec-\ntively. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think we are \nprepared to brief it based on the arguments presented \nin [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d A-201. This was entirely \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were both substantively correct and \nsignificantly different from those asserted by BLOM \nand later adopted by the district court. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting that: \u201cThe parties discussed Defendant\u2019s pro-\nposed motion to dismiss. The Court offered Plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaint to add addi-\ntional information in response to the arguments raised \nby Defendant. Plaintiffs declined to do so and repre-\nsented that they would not be seeking to amend their \nComplaint in this regard.\u201d A-78 (emphasis added). \nThat is, the district court offered Plaintiffs the oppor-\ntunity to meet BLOM\u2019s urged standards, which they \ndeclined. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters. BLOM again made a series of erroneous argu-\nments as to why Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a \nclaim.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on the district court de-\ncision in Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, \n405 F. Supp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nin relevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan \nII\u201d). Kaplan I dismissed JASTA allegations against \nLebanese Canadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d) for providing finan-\ncial services for the terrorist group Hezbollah. A-286-\n87. As BLOM pointed out, LCB provided those finan-\ncial services for fronts for Hezbollah, much as BLOM \nallegedly did for Hamas. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. In Kaplan I, the \ndistrict court acknowledged that the plaintiffs alleged \na litany of public sources, including statements from \nHezbollah itself, tying five of LCB\u2019s customers to Hez-\nbollah. But, as the Second Circuit later explained in \nreversing the decision, the district court \u201cfound these \nto be insufficient because \u2018Plaintiffs nowhere allege . . . \nthat Defendant read or was aware of such sources.\u2019\u201d \n999 F.3d at 852 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at \n535). Naturally, before discovery, a plaintiff will rarely \nbe able to find support for what sources a defendant \nhas actually read or was aware of. Nonetheless, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nA-306-07. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nResponding to Defendant\u2019s argument that Kaplan \nI correctly applied JASTA to the facts pleaded in that \ncase, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated:  \nKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of \nstep with JASTA, out of step with Linde and \nwould be impossible to meet.  \n. . .  \nRespectfully, a case that requires [allegations \nthat the bank possessed] knowledge of [Hezbol-\nlah\u2019s] purchasing of rockets [specifically] is, a[t] \na minimum, is going to render the ATA a dead \nletter, and certainly make Halberstam irrele-\nvant to the analysis.  \nA-302-03. \nDuring the oral argument, the district court reiter-\nated Plaintiffs\u2019 decision not to amend their complaint \nmade at the pre-motion conference: \u201cThere are no facts \nthat you would have to offer to address some of the \ncontentions of the defendants regarding knowledge, \nespecially?\u201d A-300. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cI \nthink we could always add allegations, but . . . we be-\nlieve the complaint goes far enough in saying that \nBLOM holding accounts for Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists designated for . . . financing HA-\nMAS, was generally aware of its role in that [il]licit \nconduct, and . . . the violence that resulted from it was \nforeseeable, as was the case in Linde.\u201d Id. \nThus, Plaintiffs declined the district court\u2019s two in-\nvitations to replead based on their (largely correct and \nentirely reasonable) understanding at that time of the \npleading standard and elements of aiding and abetting \nunder JASTA. Plaintiffs did not believe they should or \ncould amend their complaint to meet \u201cthe contentions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nof the defendant[] regarding knowledge,\u201d id., which \nwas that Plaintiffs must allege the \u201clevel of \nknowledge\u201d required in Kaplan I. That is, Plaintiffs \ndid not believe they should or could allege that BLOM \nemployees \u201cread or were aware\u201d of specific pieces of in-\nformation before discovery. See A-306-07.  \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss, largely on the grounds BLOM raised and, as \nBLOM urged, by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The dis-\ntrict court called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate com-\nparison\u201d and \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d \nthan other JASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs \nanalogized their complaint. Honickman I, 432 F. Supp. \n3d 253, 266, 269 (E.D.N.Y. 2020).  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s standard for pleading knowledge. The dis-\ntrict court explained that in Kaplan I: \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan. \nId. at 267 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535). \nHaving adopted this position, the district court then \nfaulted Plaintiffs for not alleging \u201cany acts or state-\nments by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees which suggest \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nany awareness on its part of a connection between any \nof the Three Customers and Hamas,\u201d and for relying \non \u201cpress articles, government actions, and allegedly \n\u2018public knowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such a connection. Id. \nat 265.  \nAs explained further in the next section, this error \nis especially important here because, like most victims \nof terrorism who bring suit under JASTA, Plaintiffs \ndid not have access to \u201cacts or statements of BLOM or \nBLOM\u2019s employees\u201d before discovery. Moving to \namend after dismissal\u2014or accepting the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend, such as during oral argu-\nment where BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of \nits knowledge\u2014would have been pointless. And while \nthe Second Circuit also found Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of \nBLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas \naffiliations insufficient, it did so for remediable rea-\nsons\u2014not because it required plausible allegations of \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations.  \nFinally, although Plaintiffs did not request leave to \namend, the district court noted that \u201c[i]n light of Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 rejection of the opportunity to amend their plead-\ning at the pre-motion conference, and the fact that \nthey have not identified any additional facts they \ncould allege which would address the deficiencies in \ntheir complaint, the Court finds that it need not grant \nPlaintiffs leave to amend.\u201d Id. at 270-71.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision as applying the wrong pleading stand-\nards. Petitioner faults Plaintiffs for not moving for va-\ncatur instead of appealing, or not appealing the with-\nprejudice nature of the dismissal. But, again, Plain-\ntiffs did not want leave to amend in order to meet the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous standards, nor did they have \nevidence to support allegations to do so. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nAfter briefing and argument on the appeal was \ncomplete, the Second Circuit issued its decision vacat-\ning Kaplan I as to its dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 JASTA \naiding and abetting claims against LCB. At the cir-\ncuit\u2019s direction, the Honickman parties submitted sup-\nplemental briefs on the effect of Kaplan II. Petitioners \nagain fault Plaintiffs for not asking the circuit court \nfor leave to amend in their supplemental brief, but in \nthe Second Circuit, that is a decision for the district \ncourt to make \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, \n574 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009). The circuit then is-\nsued its decision in Honickman on July 29, 2021. \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Court \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 6 F.4th 487, 490 \n(2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). Specifically, the cir-\ncuit rejected every standard the district court applied \nas grounds for dismissal, including the standard for \nalleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Customers\u2019 \naffiliation with Hamas and for alleging the general \nawareness and substantial assistance elements, which \ntogether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-\nabetting cases.\u201d Id. at 496. These are detailed infra. \nPetitioner largely elides these rejections. Moreover, \nPetitioner compares the district court\u2019s pleading \nstandards to this Court\u2019s analysis in Twitter v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023), to suggest those stand-\nards were ultimately vindicated. That is not correct, \nbut it is also irrelevant\u2014Taamneh was not issued \nwhen Plaintiffs sought amendment to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Honickman II. If Taamneh \ndid change the pleading standards in a material way, \nthat is only further reason to provide Plaintiffs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nopportunity to meet them in an amended complaint. \nAfter all, courts have long observed that \u201cRule 60(b) is \nclearly designed to permit a desirable legal objective: \nthat cases may be decided on their merits.\u201d Patapoff v. \nVollstedt\u2019s, Inc., 267 F.2d 863, 865 (9th Cir. 1959). \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe Second Circuit specifically rejected the plead-\ning standard the district court applied to Plaintiffs\u2019 \nknowledge allegations:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nHonickman II, 6 F.4th at 501 (citations omitted). \nIn Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Accordingly, the district court was required \u201cto \naccept as true the . . . factual allegations as to the re-\npeated multimedia statements by Hizbollah, to con-\nsider all of the complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nconsidering each in isolation, and to accept as true all \npermissible inferences that could be drawn from the \ncomplaint as a whole.\u201d Id. at 865.2  \nThis correction is critical because while a  proposed \namended complaint could add numerous allegations \nand cite various publications and websites in English, \nFrench and Arabic\u2014all of which would add to the \u201cper-\nmissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas\u2014those allegations would satisfy the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarified\u201d pleading standard, but not \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d requirement adopted \nby the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Honickman II, 6 F.4th at 496 (citing \n \n2  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that the U.S. did not designate the Three Customers \nor their counterparties until after the transfers at issue (although \nIsrael did). See 432 F. Supp. 3d at 265. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477, 488). It then explained \nthat the district court did not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde, one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nId. at 497 (quoting Honickman I, 432 F. Supp. 3d at \n264).  \nIn Taamneh, the Court confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected other arguments made \nby the district court and BLOM, as well. For example, \nthe circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument that providing \nindirect assistance changes the standard for pleading \nknowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan [II] did not so \nhold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual knowledge compo-\nnent of the Halberstam standard requires that the de-\nfendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \u201cassistance,\u201d . . . \nwhether directly to the FTO or indirectly through an \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \nintermediary.\u2019\u201d Id. at 500 n.16 (quoting Kaplan II, 999 \nF.3d at 863-64). See also id. at 499 n.15 (rejecting \nBLOM\u2019s argument regarding customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \n[Foreign Terrorist Organization] does not render a \nbank liable for civil aiding and abetting.\u201d Honickman \nI, 432 F. Supp. 3d at 264. The Kaplan II court ex-\nplained that so-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice \ndepending on the circumstances, and that, under \nLinde, \u201cwhether a defendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services \nto [an FTO or its affiliates should or] should not be \nviewed as routine\u2019 is a \u2018question[ ] of fact for a jury to \ndecide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at 858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at \n327) (alterations original to Kaplan II). See also \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 (noting circumstances \n\u201cwhere the provider of routine services\u201d could be liable \nfor \u201caiding and abetting a foreseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also held that the district court \nimposed \u201ca higher standard on the \u2018knowing\u2019 prong of \n\u2018knowingly and substantially assisted\u2019 than required \n. . . .\u201d Honickman II, 6 F.4th at 499-500. Finally, the \ncircuit also found that the district court misapplied \nseveral of the Halberstam substantial assistance fac-\ntors. Id. at 500-01. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nsecond element of general awareness.\u201d Id. at 501. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have), the Second Circuit identified a narrow \nset of specific and remediable deficiencies in Plaintiffs\u2019 \nknowledge allegations. \nFor example, the circuit discounted Plaintiffs\u2019 as-\nsertion that BLOM must have noticed that the Three \nCustomers were receiving funds from designated ter-\nrorist entities. The circuit noted that the complaint al-\nleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \u201cAl-\nAqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a ter-\nrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where this \n[designation] was made public.\u201d id. at 502 n.20. The \ncircuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfurther \nallegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId. These deficiencies are easily remedied in an \namended complaint by including media reports on Is-\nraeli designations and BLOM\u2019s own customer due dil-\nigence procedures, such as monitoring incoming trans-\nfers\u2014whereas Plaintiffs cannot show that BLOM \n\u201cread or was aware\u201d of those public sources without \ndiscovery.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nnoted that Plaintiffs only described the cash transac-\ntions \u201cas \u2018untraceable\u2019 for the first time in their post-\nargument letter brief\u201d suggesting that Plaintiffs \nshould be more explicit in alleging that cash is un-\ntraceable. Id. at 502 n.19. Although Plaintiffs took that \ncharacteristic of cash to be a reasonable inference, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nrather than a necessary allegation, that is easily rem-\nedied. \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained, \u201c[a]rmed with this \nCourt\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs returned to the dis-\ntrict court and moved under Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to vacate the judgment of \ndismissal and grant them leave to file a first amended \ncomplaint.\u201d Pet. App. 5. The district court denied the \nmotion, concluding that Plaintiffs waived the chance \nto amend when it declined the district court\u2019s two prior \ninvitations to meet the erroneous pleading standard \nBLOM urged and the district court adopted.  \nPlaintiffs appealed. During argument, Judge Wes-\nley\u2014who also authored Honickman II\u2014noted the case \nconstituted an \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d and \u201ca curious \nsituation,\u201d and was \u201cquirky.\u201d And as he recognized, \nPlaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong standard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder \nfor them to meet. What are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that.\u201d The dismis-\nsal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a different reason,\u201d as a result \nof a series of cases \u201cwhere the law was really recasting \nitself.\u201d \nAfter that argument, the Second Circuit decided \nMandala, another \u201cone of the exceptional cases neces-\nsitating relief from judgment.\u201d Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs brought a putative \nclass action alleging that defendant NTT Data\u2019s policy \nof not hiring people with felony convictions dispropor-\ntionately harms Black applicants. Id. at 357. The \nplaintiffs cited government reports showing \u201cBlack \npeople are arrested and incarcerated at higher rates \nthan others.\u201d Id. The district court dismissed the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \ncomplaint because it did not show if there was a simi-\nlar disparity among Black applicants for NTT\u2019s posi-\ntions, specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358. The plaintiffs petitioned for \nrehearing en banc, and although it was denied, the dis-\nsenting judges urged the plaintiffs to move for vacatur \nand amendment. The plaintiffs did, and the district \ncourt denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler Inv. GmbH v. \nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. \n2020),Williams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. \n2011), and other precedents. On February 29, 2024, \nthe Second Circuit issued the summary order at issue \nhere, likewise citing Foman and Metzler, along with \nMandala. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThe Interlocutory Posture of this Case Pre-\nsents a Poor Vehicle to Consider the Ques-\ntion Presented. \nThe interlocutory posture of this appeal makes it a \npoor vehicle to consider the question presented. Nat\u2019l \nFootball League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. Ct. 56, 57 \n(2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting denial of certiorari) \n(\u201cthe interlocutory posture is a factor counseling \nagainst this Court\u2019s review at this time\u201d); Abbott v. Ve-\nasey, 580 U.S. 1104 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting \ndenial of certiorari) (same); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., respecting denial of \ncertiorari) (same). This Court has recognized that \u201cre-\nview of a nonfinal order may induce inconvenience, lit-\nigation costs, and delay in determining ultimate jus-\ntice.\u201d Stephen M. Shapiro et al., Supreme Court Prac-\ntice Ch. 2.3, at 2-15 (11th ed. 2019) (citing Gillespie v. \nU.S. Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 152\u201353 (1964)).  \nThis concern is particularly apparent here, where \nthe Second Circuit did not even suggest what the out-\ncome of the district court\u2019s re-review of the motion \nshould be. Nor did the circuit make factual findings \nthat Petitioner suggests are necessary to deciding \nwhether vacatur is appropriate here, such as whether \nPlaintiffs made \u201c\u2018free, calculated, deliberate choices\u2019\u201d \nresulting in judgment with prejudice that are \u201c\u2018not to \nbe relieved from.\u2019\u201d Pet. 20 (quoting Ackermann v. \nUnited States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950)). Alterna-\ntively, the district court may find that Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint would be futile for other \nreasons, even under the correct pleading standard. In-\ndeed, Petitioner\u2019s counsel informed the district court \nthat \u201cwe are not at all concerned by the allegations \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nraised in the proposed amended complaint. We think \nthat they are futile . . . .\u201d A-455.  \nThis case is an even worse vehicle to review the \npurported question presented than Mandala, where \nthe Second Circuit affirmatively found that the facts \n\u201cnecessitat[ed] relief from judgment\u201d and the \u201cPlain-\ntiffs\u2019 proposed amendments address the sole pleading \ndeficiency identified by the district court.\u201d 88 F.4th at \n365 (emphasis added). A certiorari petition in Man-\ndala, which was never brought, would also have been \ninterlocutory, but at least there the defendant knew it \nhad to move against or answer a new complaint.  \nThere also is no reason to rush to review the ques-\ntion presented on an interlocutory basis. As noted be-\nlow, infra \u00a7 III, the arrangement of facts in this case, \nconstituting \u201cone of the exceptional cases necessitat-\ning relief from judgment,\u201d is exceedingly rare. Indeed, \nBLOM did not identify a single case raising similar \nfacts. Thus, there are clearly not a large number of \npending cases that would benefit from the Court\u2019s ex-\npedited resolution of the question presented. And \nBLOM\u2019s greatest potential harm here is facing an im-\nproved complaint\u2014and as noted supra p. 11, deciding \ncases on their merits is \u201ca desirable legal objective.\u201d \nThis case is also an especially poor vehicle for col-\nlaterally reviewing the Mandala decision, as Peti-\ntioner is ultimately asking this Court to do. Unlike in \nMandala, the district court here applied the wrong \nstandard, and demanded that Plaintiffs attempt to \nmeet its erroneous and largely impossible standard or \nwaive amendment forever. Its denial of vacatur was \nthus particularly inequitable, whereas granting it \nwould be appropriate under any standard urged by Pe-\ntitioner. A better case to test the \u201crule\u201d in Mandala \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nwould involve a less clear-cut set of facts favoring va-\ncatur. \nThis issue is also apparent from the Mandala dis-\nsent, notwithstanding Petitioner\u2019s reliance on it. See \nPet. 3, 12, 22. In Mandala, the plaintiffs not only in-\ncorrectly argued that the district court applied an er-\nroneous standard, but they also then argued the cir-\ncuit erred in affirming it. In his dissent, Judge Sulli-\nvan explained that, \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend at that juncture, Plaintiffs instead \nopted to file a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a stra-\ntegic choice that plainly undermines any argument \nthat some aspect of the district court\u2019s order was an \n\u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing Plaintiffs \nfrom pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368 (Sullivan, \nJ., dissenting). See also id. (noting that the plaintiffs \n\u201cdoubled down on their strategy by filing an en \nbanc petition instead of a motion to amend\u201d). Here, \nhowever, the district court did err, the circuit did clar-\nify the standard for pleading JASTA claims and Plain-\ntiffs did precisely as Judge Sullivan suggested\u2014once \nthe circuit court ruled, they sought \u201cvacatur and leave \nto amend at that juncture.\u201d  \nPetitioner argues that the dissent shows disagree-\nment on the applicable standard. But Judge Sullivan\u2019s \nargument was that where plaintiffs \u201cwere repeatedly \napprised . . . of the precise pleading defect that Plain-\ntiffs now seek to remedy,\u201d seeking an amendment is \nnot an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d for Rule 60 relief. \nId. at 368. Plaintiffs here were not so apprised, and \nonly later were they \u201c[a]rmed\u201d with the circuit\u2019s clari-\nfications\u2014constituting, even for Judge Sullivan, an \nexceptional circumstance. (Notably, Judge Sullivan \ndoes not suggest any other circuits provide a con-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nflicting view of vacatur-for-amendment, or support his \nreasoning.) \nII. \nThe Decision Below Is Correct and Does Not \nConflict with Supreme Court or Other Cir-\ncuit Precedents. \nThe summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d any-\nthing\u2014it only directs the district court to \u201creconsider \nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion\u201d in light of pre-existing Supreme \nCourt and Second Circuit standards for reviewing mo-\ntions for vacatur in the amendment context. But those \nstandards and cases it refers to are correct. And they \ndo not conflict with other Supreme Court precedent or \nother circuit precedents. The order below only sub-\nstantively cites three cases: Metzler, Mandala and this \nCourt\u2019s seminal decision in Foman, which is exten-\nsively quoted in both Metzler and Mandala. \nTo give the impression that the summary order be-\nlow raises a circuit split that was not previously ap-\nparent in Second Circuit law, Petitioner erroneously \nargues that the circuit adopted \u201ca newly crafted test\u201d \nin Mandala. Pet. 2. That \u201ctest\u201d is when reviewing a \npostjudgment motion to amend, \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 must be \ngiven to both the \u2018philosophy favoring finality of judg-\nments and the expeditious termination of litigation,\u2019 \nand the \u2018liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a).\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213). That standard is not \u201cnew\u201d\u2014BLOM omits that \nthe holding is taken directly from a 13-year-old deci-\nsion, Williams, which states that \u201cpostjudgment mo-\ntions for leave to replead must be evaluated with due \nregard to both the value of finality and the policies em-\nbodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Williams, as \nshown below, relies on Foman. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nThese cases do not conflict with this Court\u2019s or \nother circuits\u2019 precedents. Tellingly, Petitioner does \nnot mention Foman, Metzler, or Williams even once.  \nWilliams \nbegins \nwith \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit\u2019s \nlongstanding rule: \u201c[a] party seeking to file an \namended complaint postjudgment must first have the \njudgment vacated or set aside pursuant to [Rules] \n59(e) or 60(b).\u201d Id. (quoting Ruotolo v. City of New \nYork, 514 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2008)). This holding \nis the same as the purportedly \u201cconflicting\u201d holdings \nquoted by Petitioner. For example, Petitioner writes: \n\u201cThe Tenth Circuit has concluded that a post-judg-\nment motion to amend under Rule 15(a) \u2018would not be \nallowed until the judgment was set aside or vacated \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 or 60.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting \nCooper v. Shumway, 780 F.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985)). \nAnd: \u201c\u2018a plaintiff may request leave to amend [post-\njudgment] only by either appealing the judgment, or \nseeking to alter or reopen the judgment under Rule 59 \nor 60.\u201d Id. (quoting Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 \nF.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. 2003)).  \nIn fact, another of BLOM\u2019s cases quotes the same \nlanguage from the same Second Circuit decision \nquoted in Metzler: \u201conce judgment is entered, the fil-\ning of an amended complaint is not permissible until \njudgment is set aside or vacated pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 59(e) or 60(b).\u201d In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. Litig., \n511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Nat\u2019l Petro-\nchemical Co. v. M/T Stolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 244 (2d \nCir. 1991)) (cleaned up). \nAnd, just like BLOM\u2019s cited cases, the Second Cir-\ncuit rejects replacing Rule 59 or 60 standards with \nRule 15 standards. Metzler explains: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \n[We reject the] assertion that the district court \nwas obliged to consider their proposed amend-\nment only under Rule 15(a)(2), effectively re-\nplacing the standards under Rules 59(e) and \n60(b) with those in Rule 15(a)(2) to decide their \npost-judgment motion. We conclude that our \nwell-established rule that a plaintiff \u201cseeking to \nfile an amended complaint post[-]judgment \nmust first have the judgment vacated or set \naside pursuant to Rules 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d stands. \nMetzler, 970 F.3d at 145-46 (quoting Indiana Pub. Ret. \nSys. v. SAIC, Inc., 818 F.3d 85, 92 (2d Cir. 2016)). \nMoreover, the Metzler court refused to \u201callow the \u2018lib-\neral amendment policy of Rule 15(a)\u2019 to swallow the \n\u2018philosophy favoring finality of judgments\u2019 whole.\u201d Id. \nat 146 (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochem., 930 F.2d at 245). \nThus, the proposition that a motion to vacate for \namendment \u201cis governed solely by the legal standard \napplicable to Rule 15(a)(2) motions therefore is with-\nout merit.\u201d Id. at 146. \nThese holdings are essentially identical to those \nPetitioner cites. For example, Petitioner argues that \n\u201cthe Fourth Circuit observed that adopting the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach would have put it \u2018alone in the Na-\ntion in collapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the \nstandard for Rule 15(a).\u2019\u201d Pet. 14 (quoting Daulatzai v. \nMaryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. 2024)). But that \nis not what the Second Circuit did here\u2014again, it held \nthat the argument \u201cis without merit.\u201d Metzler, 970 \nF.3d at 146. That is why Daulatzai\u2014which postdated \nevery single decision discussed herein, including the \nsummary order at issue here, and did not mention Sec-\nond Circuit standards at all\u2014would have been \u201calone \nin the Nation\u201d if it held otherwise. Neither the Fourth \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \nCircuit nor Petitioner have found a case to the con-\ntrary. \nOne of Petitioner\u2019s Sixth Circuit cases likewise \nholds that \u201cinstead of meeting only the modest re-\nquirements of Rule 15, the claimant must meet the re-\nquirements for reopening a case established by Rules \n59 or 60.\u201d Moreland v. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 327 \n(6th Cir. 2016). And one of its Ninth Circuit cases af-\nfirmed denial of a motion for vacatur and amendment \nthat \u201cargu[ed] only that it met the standard under \nRule 15.\u201d 3WL, LLC v. Master Prot., Ltd. P\u2019ship, 851 \nF. App\u2019x 4, 8 (9th Cir. 2021). Even Petitioner\u2019s precise \ncitation to Wright & Miller\u2019s Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure not only restates the standards from Wil-\nliams\u2014it cites it. 6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. \nCiv. \u00a7 1489 n.3 (3d ed.) (and Williams cites Wright & \nMiller for this proposition, see 659 F.3d at 213).  \nNor do these Second Circuit cases conflict with this \nCourt\u2019s precedents. Petitioner\u2019s cases speak to the pol-\nicy of preserving the finality of judgments generally\u2014\nbut none go nearly as far as Petitioner suggests. In-\ndeed, in one, this Court rejected the same argument \nPetitioner makes here: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the \nimportance of preserving the finality of judgments. \nBut the \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an \nexception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 126 \n(2017) (citations omitted). And as this Court wrote in \na case cited by Petitioner: \u201c[W]e give little weight to \nrespondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of finality. That pol-\nicy consideration, standing alone, is unpersuasive in \nthe interpretation of a provision whose whole purpose \nis to make an exception to finality.\u201d Gonzalez v. \nCrosby, 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). \nBLOM\u2019s exaggeration of this Court\u2019s precedents is \nclearest from the first one it quotes: \u201c\u2018[t]here must be \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nan end to litigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet. 1 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198). But in Ackermann, the \npetitioners sought vacatur four years after judgments \nwere entered following a trial, in order to bring an ex-\ntremely late appeal. Here, the case has not even en-\ntered discovery, and Plaintiffs sought vacatur and \namendment within days of the Second Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion rejecting the district court\u2019s pleading standards \nand \u201carming\u201d Plaintiffs with its \u201cclarifications.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court \nmeant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nBLOM also cites Ackermann for the proposition \nthat \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d Pet. 1 (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198). See also Pet. i, 1, 21 (arguing that Pioneer Inv. \nServs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, \n393 (1993) \u201csuggest[s] that the party [must be] fault-\nless in the delay\u201d). But as noted above, Plaintiffs have \nnot erred here\u2014the district court did by \u201ccon-\ntraven[ing]\u201d governing law, as the Second Circuit \nfound. Honickman II, 6 F.4th at 497. See also Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 359 (\u201cinsufficient pleading is not cat-\negorically a \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their \nComplaint satisfied the standards for pleading a dis-\nparate impact claim was well-founded, even if ulti-\nmately erroneous\u201d). Anyway, as noted above, whether \nPlaintiffs also somehow erred would be a factual find-\ning that the decision below did not even make\u2014it is \nthus among the considerations remanded to the dis-\ntrict court. There is nothing for this Court to review in \nthat regard. \nThat leaves BLOM with the recognition in Honick-\nman II that a district court should give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \n\u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of judgments . . . \nand the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a).\u2019\u201d Pet. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \nApp. 7. BLOM asserts that this balancing test conflicts \nwith this Court\u2019s and other circuit\u2019s precedents. \nIt does not. As noted above, Mandala\u2019s balancing \ntest is taken almost verbatim from Williams, which in \nturn took it directly from Foman. See Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 213-14. In Foman, this Court held it was an \nabuse of discretion to deny \u201cpetitioner\u2019s motion to va-\ncate the judgment in order to allow amendment of the \ncomplaint,\u201d even where \u201cthe amendment would have \ndone no more than state an alternative theory for re-\ncovery.\u201d 371 U.S. at 182. \nThis Court explained:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. If the underlying facts \nor circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may \nbe a proper subject of relief, he ought to be af-\nforded an opportunity to test his claim on the \nmerits. . . . Of course, the grant or denial of an \nopportunity to amend is within the discretion of \nthe District Court, but outright refusal to grant \nthe leave without any justifying reason appear-\ning for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; \nit is merely abuse of that discretion and incon-\nsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBLOM does not mention Foman even once\u2014de-\nspite contending that the summary order below \u201cis at \nodds with over a century of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence \nprotecting the finality of judgments.\u201d Pet. 19. The \nomission of this \u201cseminal\u201d postjudgment amendment \ncase is telling. See, e.g., Marley v. Kaiser Found. \nHealth, Plan of the Mid-Atlantic States, Inc., No. 17-\ncv-01902-PWG, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195578, at *7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \n(D. Md. Nov. 15, 2018) (\u201cin the seminal case of Foman \nv. Davis, the Supreme Court held a trial court should \nhave allowed a plaintiff to amend her complaint even \nafter entering a judgment for the defendant on the ba-\nsis of a motion to dismiss\u201d). Foman has been cited in \nother cases over 44,000 times, but not once by Peti-\ntioner. \nMoreover, the balancing standard does not conflict \nwith Petitioner\u2019s cited cases. The Second Circuit ex-\nplained the standard as follows: \u201ccourts \u2018should freely \ngive leave\u2019 to amend a complaint \u2018when justice so re-\nquires.\u2019 Where, however, a party does not seek leave to \nfile an amended complaint until after judgment is en-\ntered, Rule 15\u2019s liberality must be tempered by consid-\nerations of finality.\u201d Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361. This \nline is substantively identical to the holdings of Peti-\ntioner\u2019s cases: \u201cRule 15 requests to amend the com-\nplaint are . . . generally speaking, \u2018freely\u2019 allowed,\u201d but \nwhen raised post-judgment, courts then \u201cmust \u2018con-\nsider[] the competing interest of protecting the finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Leisure Caviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife \nServ., 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th Cir. 2010). See also \nNation v. DOI, 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(\u201cAfter judgment, then, \u2018our policy of promoting the fi-\nnality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness.\u201d) (quoting Lindauer v. Rogers, 91 \nF.3d 1355, 1357 (9th Cir. 1996) (emphasis added).  \nYet another of Petitioner\u2019s cases acknowledges that \nthe policy of \u201cprevent[ing] litigants from resurrecting \nclaims on which they have lost\u201d may be \u201cabsent\u201d in cer-\ntain circumstances. Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 \nF.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001). And Petitioner\u2019s Sev-\nenth Circuit case, Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 \nF.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. 1996), acknowledged a prior \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \ndecision stating that while \u201cnever address[ing] the \nmerits of the [postjudgment] motion for leave to \namend\u201d \u201cmight be appropriate in some cases, we be-\nlieve that, in general, when a party simultaneously \nfiles both motions, the district court will have to exam-\nine the merits of a motion for leave to amend before it \ncan decide whether or not to grant the party\u2019s Rule \n59(e) or 60(b) motion.\u201d Paganis v. Blonstein, 3 F.3d \n1067, 1073 n.7 (7th Cir. 1993). \nAgain, not a single one of BLOM\u2019s cases involved \ncircumstances analogous to those at issue here, and \nnone suggest a different result would obtain here. In-\nstead, they largely track the facts in Metzler, where \nthe Second Circuit affirmed denying vacatur. There, \n\u201cthe district court issued a thorough opinion that iden-\ntified defects that a second amended complaint should \ncure,\u201d but \u201c[e]ven with the benefit of that opinion, how-\never, the plaintiffs failed to cure such deficiencies in \ntheir Second Amended Complaint.\u201d 970 F.3d at 145. \nLikewise, in Deak, which Petitioner also relies on, the \nThird Circuit affirmed denial of vacatur where the de-\nfendant \u201chad ample opportunity to move to amend \nwhile the case was open but did not do so until after it \nwas closed.\u201d Dominos Pizza LLC v. Deak, 534 F. App\u2019x \n171, 175 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nIII. \nThe Question Presented Does Not Merit Re-\nview \nFinally, Petitioner is wrong that the question pre-\nsented is sufficiently important that it merits the ex-\ntraordinary assertion of the Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdic-\ntion over an interlocutory appeal (and without a circuit \nsplit). As stated above, this case and Mandala are the \n\u201cexceptional cases necessitating relief from judgment,\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365. This case even more so\u2014\nPetitioner has not cited a single other case where (1) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \nthe district court dismissed a complaint on an incor-\nrect legal basis which was essentially unmeetable by \nplaintiffs and (2) which the circuit court rejected but \n(3) the complaint nevertheless failed to meet the clar-\nified standard but (4) the circuit found that failure was \nremediable in an amendment.  \nPetitioner promises all manner of gamesmanship \nwill result from the balancing of Rule 60\u2019s and Rule \n15\u2019s principles. But it has not explained how that could \noccur under the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d of Man-\ndala or the even more \u201cunusual\u201d ones here. Indeed, it \nis BLOM\u2019s urged result that would result in profound \nunfairness. In BLOM\u2019s view, Rule 60 permits district \ncourts to bar valid claims or counterclaims by demand-\ning they meet erroneous\u2014and unmeetable\u2014stand-\nards and then denying litigants the opportunity to \namend even after a court of appeals corrects the error. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should deny the petition for certiorari. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nMichael Radine\n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

These \nservices substantially assisted Hezbollah by providing it \nwith access to potentially millions of untraceable dollars, \nforeseeably risking terrorist attacks.\nThe Kaplan lower court, 405 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. \n2019), dismissed the complaint on three grounds: (1) the \nplaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that LCB knew the Five \nCustomers were affiliated with Hezbollah; (2) even if LCB \nknowingly provided financial services to Hezbollah, that \nknowledge would not meet JASTA\u2019s \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d \nstandard; and (3) LCB did not knowingly provide \nsubstantial assistance because it did not \u201cknowingly and \nintentionally support\u201d the rocket attacks or knowingly \nprovide money to Hezbollah itself.\nThis Court rejected all three grounds for dismissal. \nFirst, it held that a complaint may \u201ccontain general \n\nAppendix J\n261a\nallegations as to a defendant\u2019s knowledge\u201d (that its \ncustomers were FTO affiliates)\u2014including relying on the \nplausible inference that the defendant would be aware of \npublicly available information. Kaplan at 864. Second, \nit confirmed that JASTA, incorporating Halberstam v. \nWelch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), requires allegations \nthat a defendant \u201cwas generally aware of its role in an \n\u2018overall illegal activity\u2019 from which an \u2018act of international \nterrorism\u2019 was a foreseeable risk,\u201d and that \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d is a less demanding standard than actual \nawareness. Id. at 860, 863-64. Finally, it held that plaintiffs \nneed only show a bank \u201cknowingly provid[ed] assistance\u2014\nwhether directly .\u00a0.\u00a0. or indirectly\u2014and .\u00a0.\u00a0. that assistance \nwas substantial,\u201d id. at 866\u2014not that it \u201cknowingly and \nintentionally supported\u201d terrorist attacks.\nKaplan compels reversal here because the Kaplan and \nHonickman complaints are substantially similar\u2014indeed, \nthe court below rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 citations to other \nJASTA and ATA decisions, finding twice that a \u201cmore \nappropriate comparison is Judge Daniels\u2019s recent decision \nin Kaplan,\u201d SPA-24. See also SPA-31. In both Kaplan \nand Honickman: (1) the plaintiffs are Americans injured \nin terrorist attacks while traveling or living in Israel; \n(2) the attacks were committed by FTOs that operated \nopenly in Lebanon and were notorious for committing \nterrorist attacks on civilians in Israel over many years; \n(3) the defendants are Lebanese banks that allegedly \nprovided banking services to FTOs through organizations \nbelonging to the FTOs\u2019 respective \u201csocial wings\u201d; (4) \nthe banks allowed the FTOs to convert international \nfunds transfers into unusual cash transactions capable \n\nAppendix J\n262a\nof circumventing anti-money laundering and counter-\nterror sanctions; (5) the banks\u2019 customers were publicly \nassociated with the FTOs in Lebanon and headed by \nprominent leaders of the respective FTOs; and (6) those \ncustomers were later designated as Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists (\u201cSDGTs\u201d) by the United States.\nBecause of these similarities, the district court in \nHonickman explicitly adopted the three holdings from \nthe lower Kaplan decision\u2014including its erroneous \napplication of Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d 314 \n(2d Cir. 2018) and Siegel v. HSBC N. Am. Holdings, Inc., \n933 F.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2019)\u2014that this Court specifically \nrejected on appeal. These errors require reversal here. \nI. \t KAPLAN REQUIRES REVERSAL ON GENERAL \nAWARENESS\nAs Plaintiffs argued in their prior briefs, the district \ncourt improperly rejected the Halberstam standard as \nforeclosed by Linde and Siegel: \u201cIn light of [Siegel and \nLinde], it is not enough for Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege \nthat BLOM was generally aware of [its] role in terrorist \nactivities, from which terrorist attacks were a natural \nand foreseeable consequence.\u201d SPA-18 (citations omitted). \nSee also SPA-19 n.8 (erroneously finding that general \nawareness of a role in \u201cHamas\u2019s terrorist enterprise,\u201d \neven if sufficient under Halberstam, would still not satisfy \nLinde). This Court rejected LCB\u2019s (nearly verbatim) \nrendition of this same argument, Kaplan at 860, writing, \n\u201cnothing in Linde repudiates the Halberstam standard \nthat a defendant may be liable for aiding and abetting an \n\nAppendix J\n263a\nact of terrorism if it was generally aware of its role in an \n\u2018overall illegal activity\u2019 from which an \u2018act of international \nterrorism\u2019 was a foreseeable risk.\u201d Id.\nThis Court further found the rocket attacks at issue \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d from the banking services LCB provided \nto its customers, including the Martyrs Foundation \n(\u201cShahid\u201d). Id. at 860-61. This is consistent with the \nSupreme Court\u2019s finding that even the deconflicting \ntraining plaintiffs challenging \u00a7\u00a02339B proposed providing \nto an FTO (\u201cPKK\u201d) could foreseeably lead to violence:\nIt is wholly foreseeable that the PKK could \nuse the \u201cspecific skill[s]\u201d that plaintiffs propose \nto impart, .\u00a0.\u00a0. as part of a broader strategy \nto promote terrorism. The PKK could, for \nexample, pursue peaceful negotiation as \na means of buying time to recover from \nshort-term setbacks, lulling opponents into \ncomplacency, and ultimately preparing for \nrenewed attacks.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . A foreign terrorist \norganization introduced to the structures \nof the international legal system might use \nthe information to threaten, manipulate, and \ndisrupt. This possibility is real, not remote.\nHolder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 36-37 \n(2010) (emphasis added).\nProviding millions of dollars in untraceable cash to an \nFTO creates a much more foreseeable risk of terrorist acts \nthan deconflicting training. The Supreme Court explained: \n\nAppendix J\n264a\n\u201c[m]oney is fungible, and Congress logically concluded \nthat money a terrorist group such as the PKK obtains \nusing the techniques plaintiffs propose to teach could \nbe redirected to funding the group\u2019s violent activities.\u201d \nId. at 37 (emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit likewise \nheld that Hamas attacks in Israel were \u201cforeseeable \nconsequences\u201d of \u201caugmenting Hamas\u2019s resources,\u201d by \nproviding it with money. Boim v. Holy Land Found. \nfor Relief & Dev., 549 F.3d 685, 694 (7th Cir. 2008) (en \nbanc). Thus, \u201cearmark[ing]\u201d funds \u201cfor the organization\u2019s \nnonterrorist activities does not get you off the liability \nhook,\u201d given \u201cthe fungibility of money.\u201d Id. at 698. Funds \nfor BLOM\u2019s \u201cThree Customers\u201d freed up funds which, \nfor example, Hamas\u2019s operatives in Lebanon funneled to \ntheir counterparts in the Palestinian Territories to finance \nterrorist attacks. Compl. \u00b6\u00a0587.1\nFinally, even were money not fungible, \u201cHamas\u2019s social \nwelfare activities reinforce its terrorist activities\u201d by \nsupporting families of terrorists and \u201cenhancing Hamas\u2019s \npopularity among the Palestinian population.\u201d Boim at \n698. As a result, \u201c[a]nyone who knowingly contributes \nto the nonviolent wing of an organization that he knows \nto engage in terrorism is knowingly contributing to the \norganization\u2019s terrorist activities.\u201d Id.\nII. \tKAPLAN REQUIRES REVERSAL ON THE \nPLEADING STANDARD FOR KNOWLEDGE\nPlaintiffs provided detailed allegations supporting \nthe plausible inference that BLOM knew the Hamas \n1.\u2002 All paragraph citations herein are to the Complaint, Joint \nAppendix at 81-166.\n\nAppendix J\n265a\naffiliations of the Three Customers and their transferors. \nPlaintiffs plausibly pleaded that Hamas operated openly \nin Lebanon as a terrorist group since at least 1994 \nand that articles published in major newspapers from \n1994-2001 described Hamas fundraising. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0514, 528-\n30. Sanabil and the Union of Good were run by Hamas \nleaders; Plaintiffs provided their names and positions \nand showed that Sanabil\u2019s directors had prominent roles \nin Lebanon during the relevant period. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0591-94, 639. \nBLOM deposited vast sums into the Sanabil and Subul \nal-Khair accounts from Hamas fundraisers Interpal, \nCBSP, and Al-Aqsa Foundation (\u201cAAF\u201d) after they \nwere designated by Israel (and in AAF\u2019s case, also by \nGermany) and continued servicing these accounts after \ntheir biggest funding source, Holy Land Foundation \n(\u201cHLF\u201d), was designated an SDGT by the United States \nin 2001 (including depositing hundreds of thousands of \ndollars from HLF\u2019s successor organization, KindHearts, \ninto Sanabil\u2019s accounts). \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0539, 542, 550-51, 554, 567, \n588, 590, 596-606, 623-25. Finally, BLOM permitted \nSanabil and Subul al-Khair to withdraw these funds in \nblocks of untraceable cash, \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0611, 626, in an area where \nHamas regularly transferred funds to its operatives in \nthe Palestinian Territories, \u00b6\u00a0587.\nThese allegations comport with this Court\u2019s holding \nin Kaplan that, under JASTA, defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cmust \nbe evaluated in the context of the enterprise they aided,\u201d \nKaplan at 865 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488), \nwhich context includes the relevant FTO\u2019s \u201cpolicy and \npractice of engaging in terrorist raids\u2014and repeatedly \npublicizing that policy and practice,\u201d the duration of its \n\nAppendix J\n266a\n\u201ccampaign of terrorist attacks against civilians,\u201d the \ntiming of the banking services provided, and the amounts \nof money furnished to the FTO as a result. Id. Here, \nBLOM knew it was transferring millions of dollars for \nPalestinian organizations in Lebanon belonging to Hamas \nin the midst of an intensive Hamas terror campaign \nagainst Israeli and American civilians.\nThe court below, however, heavily relied on the lower \nKaplan decision in rejecting these types of knowledge \nallegations; it found publicly available information \ninherently insufficient, quoting Judge Daniels\u2019s finding \nthat although the plaintiffs there alleged \u201cthe entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u2018was [sic] openly, publicly and \nrepeatedly acknowledged and publicized by Hizbollah,\u201d \nthey \u201c\u2018nowhere allege[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. that [LCB] read or was aware \nof such sources.\u2019\u201d SPA-26 (quoting Kaplan, 405 F.\u00a0Supp. \n3d at 535). The district court did the same in suggesting \nthat preexisting, U.S. designations are necessary to allege \nknowledge, citing the Kaplan finding that \u201c[n]one of the \nentities were designated by the United States prior to \nthe rocket attacks at issue as having an affiliation with \nHizbollah.\u201d SPA-25-26 (quoting Kaplan, 405 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d \nat 535).\nThis Court rejected all of these propositions. First, it \nexplained that \u201c[a] complaint is allowed to contain general \nallegations as to a defendant\u2019s knowledge, see Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 9(b), because \u2018a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected \nto plead a defendant\u2019s actual state of mind.\u2019\u201d Id. at 864 \n(quoting Conn. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Fluor Corp., 808 F.2d 957, \n962 (2d Cir. 1987)). See also Pls. Mem. at 29-32 (citing \n\nAppendix J\n267a\ncases). It thus rejected the requirement that plaintiffs \nplead that a bank \u201c\u2018read or was aware of such sources,\u2019\u201d \nexplaining that \u201cthe court was required to accept as true \nthe above factual allegations as to the repeated multimedia \nstatements by Hizbollah, to consider all of the complaint\u2019s \nallegations, rather than considering each in isolation, and \nto accept as true all permissible inferences that could be \ndrawn from the complaint as a whole.\u201d Kaplan at 864-\n65. Second, it held prior U.S. designations are not \u201ca \nprerequisite for knowledge,\u201d as \u201cit would defy common \nsense to hold that such knowledge could be gained in no \nother way.\u201d Id. at 864.\nA. \t BLOM Provided Financial Services for Integral \nHamas Entities, \u201cClosely Intertwined\u201d with Its \nViolent Activities and Did so in Unusual Ways.\nMuch as LCB was alleged to have done in Kaplan, \nBLOM knowingly transferred millions of dollars for \nso-called charities that incentivized suicide bombings \nand encouraged violence; indeed, several are Specially \nDesignated Global Terrorists. For instance, BLOM \ndeposited millions of dollars from HLF, an SDGT and the \n\u201ccrown jewel in HAMAS\u2019s global fundraising network.\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a0563. Like Shahid in Kaplan, HLF:\nprovided crucial financial support for families \nof HAMAS suicide bombers, as well as the \nPalestinians who adhere to the HAMAS \nmovement. It is believed that by providing these \nannuities to families of HAMAS members, the \n[HLF] assists HAMAS by providing a constant \n\nAppendix J\n268a\nflow of suicide volunteers and buttresses a \nterrorist infrastructure heavily reliant on \nmoral support of the Palestinian populace.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \n[HLF\u2019s] mission is to support the families of \nthe martyrs.\n\u00b6\u00a0566. BLOM transferred these funds into the Hamas-\ncontrolled Sanabil and Subul al-Khair accounts, along \nwith funds from AAF, which Germany found in 2002 \u201ccalls \nfor violence\u201d to achieve Hamas\u2019s goals and the United \nStates called \u201ca critical part of HAMAS\u2019 terrorist support \ninfrastructure.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0552-54.\nSanabil, \u201cHamas\u2019s da\u2019wa headquarters in Lebanon,\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a0588, \u201creceive[d] large quantities of funds raised by major \nHAMAS-affiliated charities in Europe and the Middle \nEast and, in turn, provide[d] funding to HAMAS,\u201d and \nhelped \u201crecruit[] permanent members\u201d for Hamas. \u00b6\u00a0590. \nSubul al-Khair performed similar functions in the Beirut \narea, and \u201cwas identified as an unindicted co-conspirator \nin HLF\u2019s criminal trial.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0621-28. The Union of Good \nwas \u201cthe umbrella organization for HAMAS\u2019s global \nfundraising activity\u201d (its 50 constituent organizations \nincluded SDGTs Interpal and CBSP, \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0629-30) and acted \nas a broker for Hamas fundraising for \u201c[t]he primary \npurpose\u201d of \u201cstrengthen[ing] HAMAS\u2019 political and \nmilitary position in the West Bank and Gaza, including \nby [] diverting charitable donations to support HAMAS \nmembers and the families of terrorist operatives.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a063 5. In sum, the Three Customers and their various \ntransferors were \u201cclosely intertwined with [Hamas\u2019s] \nviolent terrorist activities,\u201d Kaplan at 860-61\u2014indeed, \n\nAppendix J\n269a\nthey were Hamas alter egos. The district court discounted \nthese allegations in finding \u201cno allegations whatsoever \nlink[ing] the Three Customers to Hamas\u2019 violent \nactivities.\u201d SPA-27.2\nAs in Kaplan, BLOM also permitted the Three \nCustomers to engage in non-routine conduct obscuring \ntheir uses for the funds they funneled for Hamas. As an \ninitial matter, this Court noted in Kaplan that \u201cwhether \na defendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is a \n\u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d Kaplan at 858 \n(quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327).3 But BLOM did not \njust provide financial services to the Three Customers \nknowing they belonged to an FTO\u2014it permitted at least \ntwo of them to withdraw funds in bulk cash.4 Rather than \n2.\u2002 This is not to say such allegations are always necessary: \nLCB\u2019s services for its other Hezbollah customers\u2014Yousser, \nBayt al-Mal, and their officers\u2014were not alleged to have direct \nconnections to Hezbollah violence per se, yet they constituted \nrelevant allegations supporting the Kaplan plaintiffs\u2019 claims. And \nwhile Shahid paid families of suicide bombers, the attacks at issue \nin Kaplan were rocket attacks, not suicide bombings.\n3.\u2002 This Court\u2019s Linde discussion refutes the district court\u2019s \nfinding that, under Linde, \u201cthe mere provision of routine banking \nservices to an FTO does not render a bank liable for civil aiding \nand abetting.\u201d SPA-17.\n4.\u2002 Plaintiffs here provided much more detailed allegations \nabout the millions of dollars in transfers BLOM processed for \nHamas than did the plaintiffs in Kaplan, where the allegations \nlargely described the scope of the cash-reporting exemptions LCB \noffered to Hezbollah entities, but offered few details on actual \ntransactions.\n\nAppendix J\n270a\npurchasing goods or services by check or wire transfer, as \na charity or business typically would, Sanabil and Subul \nal-Khair withdrew funds in untraceable bank notes. \n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0611, 613, 626, 628. As BLOM itself suggested, it never \n\u201cknew how Subul al-Khair [or Sanabil] used its cash once \nwithdrawn.\u201d Def. Mem. at 32.\nLarge cash withdrawals are a clear indicator of \ncriminal activity; for example, MENAFATF\u2014the agency \nreferenced in Kaplan at 849\u2014has explained that \u201c[c]ash \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. remains the raw material of most criminal activity. In \nmany cases, even when the proceeds of a crime are initially \ngenerated in electronic form .\u00a0.\u00a0. criminals choose to \nwithdraw the funds from a bank account in cash, transport \nit to another country, and pay it into another account in \norder to break an audit trail.\u201d5 BLOM suggests it may not \nhave found the withdrawals suspicious because it is \u201cat \nleast equally plausible that large cash withdrawals would \nbe needed to provide humanitarian aid\u201d in refugee camps, \nDef. Mem. at 32\u2014but (purportedly) \u201cequally plausible\u201d \ninferences of BLOM\u2019s beliefs about the uses of the cash \n(or its fungibility) favor plaintiffs on a 12(b)(6) motion. \nSee Kaplan at 854 (\u201cThe plausibility standard is not akin \nto a \u2018probability requirement,\u2019 but it asks for more than a \nsheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d) \n(citation omitted).\n5.\u2002 MENAFATF, \u201cMoney Laundering Through the Physical \nTransportation of Cash,\u201d at 3 (Oct. 2015), available at https://www.\nfatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/money-laundering-\nthrough-transportation-cash.pdf.\n\nAppendix J\n271a\nIndeed, Hamas used Lebanon as a political and \nfundraising base, both for competing with its rivals \nHezbollah and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n(\u201cPLO\u201d), and for funneling funds to its operational \ncomponents in the Palestinian Territories. As Plaintiffs \nalleged:\nFor example, senior HAMAS activist Jamal \nal-Tawil, who was one of the Movement\u2019s most \nimportant operatives in the Ramallah area, \nwas arrested by Israel in 2002 and later told \nhis interrogators that he received $12,000 per \nmonth from HAMAS\u2019s leadership in Lebanon. \nOther notorious HAMAS operatives in the \nPalestinian Territories ranging from Abbas \nal-Sayed (mastermind of the Park Hotel suicide \nbombing in Netanya) to Jamal Mansur, one \nof HAMAS\u2019s senior operatives in Nablus to \nSheikh Ahmed Yassin himself, received funds \ntransfers from representatives of HAMAS\u2019s \nbureau in Lebanon.\n\u00b6\u00a0587. Untraceable funds thus went to, or freed up funds \nthat went to, the Palestinian Territories.\nThe district court instead pointed to the stated \ncharitable purposes given by AAF, Sanabil, and other \ndesignated terrorists on their transfers or other \ndocumentation. SPA-22-23. But it goes without saying \nthat terrorist groups, especially when operating under \ncharitable cover (from jurisdictions that have outlawed \n\nAppendix J\n272a\nthem), do not write \u201cfor terrorism\u201d or \u201cfor bombs\u201d on their \ntransfers or mission statements. As shown above, the \nU.S. government found that Sanabil \u201cprovide[d] funding \nto Hamas\u201d and the Union of Good \u201cdivert[ed] charitable \ndonations\u201d to \u201cfamilies of terrorist operatives.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0590, \n635. The Supreme Court explained that terrorist groups \nregularly use charities as cover for terror financing and \nrecruitment, Holder, 561 U.S. at 31, something surely \nwell-known in Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon. See Pls. \nMem. at 35 & n.8, Pls. Reply at 24 & n.12. Indeed, the \nU.S. government has confirmed that:\nWhile Hamas thus engages in many different \nactivities, it is one organization. The social and \ncharitable elements of Hamas are inexorably \nintertwined with the terrorist elements in the \norganization\u2019s overall mission. [Its] charitable \nnetwork helps it maintain popular support, to \ncompete with the Palestinian Authority, and to \nrecruit activists, including individuals for its \ndeadly terrorist attacks.\n.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . Hamas\u2019 charitable associations serve \nin part as a screen for its covert activities, \nproviding a benign cover through which money \ncan be transferred from overseas into Hamas-\ncontrolled institutions. The overseas funds \nflowing into Hamas\u2019 social and charitable \ninfrastructure free other resources for use in \nterrorist operations.\n\nAppendix J\n273a\nBrief of the U.S., Holy Land Foundation v. Ashcroft, 2003 \nWL 25586055 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The court below rejected \nthis fundamental precept, finding no evidence that \u201cany of \nthese transfers \u2018were used to perpetrate any of the [violent \nacts]\u2019 allegedly carried out by Hamas,\u201d SPA-21 n.9\u2014but, \nof course, there were no allegations tracing transfers to \nattacks in Kaplan, either.\nB. \t BLOM Knew the Entities It Serviced Were \nHamas Entities\nAs in Kaplan, publicly available information supports \nthe inference that BLOM knew it was transferring money \non behalf of Hamas entities. Like LCB, BLOM operated \nin Lebanon, where Hamas had a longstanding presence as \na well-known violent terrorist group. See Kaplan at 865 \n(noting Hezbollah\u2019s and LCB\u2019s history in Lebanon). Hamas \nwas established in 1987, was designated an FTO by the \nU.S. in 1997, and has operated openly in Lebanon since \nat least 1994. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a012, 508-13, 535, 574-75, 586. See Kaplan \nat 864 (crediting allegations that Hezbollah \u201chad been \ndesignated by the United States as an FTO since 1997\u201d \nand had \u201copenly, publicly, and repeatedly acknowledged \ncarrying out terrorist attacks against civilians\u201d). The \nemerging presence of Hamas in the Palestinian refugee \ncamps was widely publicized in the Lebanese press, \u00b6\u00a0578, \nwhere two of the Three Customers operated. Hamas \nleaders in Lebanon also operated openly, establishing \npublic institutions like the \u201cPalestinian Ulema League\u201d \nin 1998 and, of course, the Three Customers themselves. \n\u00b6\u00b6\u00a0582-84.\n\nAppendix J\n274a\nMoreover, Hamas created the Three Customers in \norder to raise its profile in Lebanon to compete with \nother organizations like Hezbollah and the PLO. Thus, \nas the FBI reported in 2001, Sanabil was among a dozen \nHamas entities that were \u201ceither known fronts for Hamas, \nknown supporters of Hamas, or entities whose funding \nis known to benefit the Hamas agenda.\u201d Pls. Mem. at 32 \n(quoting A-273 at 28:18-23) (emphasis added). Likewise, \nthe Union of Good was created by Hamas as part of a \nfundraising drive during the Second Intifada; it was \nhardly an obscure or shadowy organization in the Middle \nEast. It was chaired by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the \nMuslim Brotherhood\u2019s spiritual leader and one of the \nregion\u2019s most recognizable figures with a long running \ntelevision program on Al Jazeera, on which he publicly \ncalled for suicide bombing attacks against Israel. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0630-\n32, 636-38 (specifying date of broadcast). Thus, while \nthese organizations provided Hamas \u201ccharitable cover\u201d \nwhen operating in the West; they operated openly in \nLebanon. Furthermore, these groups were run by senior \nHamas leadership. \u201cSanabil\u2019s board members were \npredominantly well-known HAMAS leaders in Lebanon,\u201d \n\u00b6\u00a0591 (emphasis added), meaning Hamas leaders known \nduring the relevant period (Sanabil closed in 2003). See \nalso \u00b6\u00a0639 (\u201cHAMAS leaders have also served openly \nin the Union of Good\u2019s executive leadership.\u201d).6 These \n6.\u2002 The district court faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations for not \nproviding more specific date and transactional information for the \nUnion of Good accounts BLOM held, but such details are rarely \navailable at the pleading stage (whereas the other two customers \nwere directly implicated in the HLF prosecution). But the Union \nof Good was at all times a known Hamas organization, so even \n\nAppendix J\n275a\nfacts satisfy the \u201cgeneral allegations\u201d standard clarified \nin Kaplan, which relied, in part, on public associations \nbetween Hezbollah and LCB\u2019s customers. The allegations \nin Kaplan do not constitute the minimum required to \nplausibly plead JASTA aiding and abetting, and the \ncases are naturally not identical. For example, Kaplan \ninvolves certain allegations not present here, but that \ncomplaint also benefited from evidence collected by the \nUnited States in designating LCB a financial institution \nof primary money laundering concern and seizing some \nof its assets. JASTA claims are, of course, not limited to \nclaims against the handful of banks the United States \nhas designated.\nMoreover, Plaintiffs have made allegations here not \npresent in Kaplan. For instance, Plaintiffs here alleged \nthat BLOM provided substantial assistance to Hamas \nafter a number of its fundraising entities were designated. \nBLOM kept transferring millions of dollars into Sanabil\u2019s \naccounts after its main donor, HLF, was designated by \nthe United States in 2001, \u00b6\u00a0567, including from HLF\u2019s \nsuccessor, KindHearts (Treasury froze its assets in \n2006, \u00b6\u00a0619). Israel designated Sanabil funders CBSP, \nInterpal\u2014Sanabil was Interpal\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d representative \nin Lebanon, \u00b6\u00a0607\u2014and AAF as Hamas entities in 1997 \nand terrorist organizations in 1998, \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0 539, 542, 550 \nif discovery later establishes that BLOM held those accounts \nonly after the relevant period, BLOM\u2019s willingness to maintain \naccounts for a notorious Hamas fundraising entity supports the \ninference that BLOM willingly held other Hamas accounts during \nthe relevant period without compunction.\n\nAppendix J\n276a\n(Germany closed AAF\u2019s offices in 2002, \u00b6\u00a055 1), and the \nUnion of Good itself in 2002, \u00b6\u00a0634.7\nThe district court found it implausible that BLOM \nwould have noticed any of these repeated, successive \ndesignations. But the opposite is true\u2014taking together \nthe allegations of the numerous indicia BLOM had that the \nThree Customers were Hamas entities, the sheer volume \nof the transfers, the unusual conduct of withdrawing \nthose funds in bulk cash, the raging terror campaign \nHamas conducted against Israel 50 miles away, \u201crather \nthan considering each in isolation,\u201d Kaplan at 865, it is \nmore than plausible that BLOM would have noticed the \nU.S. designation of Sanabil\u2019s largest donor (a news event \nin itself) and Israel\u2019s designation of its other primary \nfunders. The district court made the same error in \nrejecting the significance of HLF\u2019s 2001 designation \nbecause HLF made no transfers after that date\u2014but it is \nmore than plausible that BLOM would have investigated \ncustomers publicly associated with Hamas and found \nthey had been primarily funded by an infamous SDGT \nand Hamas\u2019s \u201ccrown jewel.\u201d \u00b6\u00a0563. The district court \nlikewise rejected the significance of BLOM\u2019s deposit \nof funds from AAF after the United States designated \nit. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0604-05, Exhibit D. While that single transaction \nannexed to the Complaint might be insufficient alone, \ntaken together with the other evidence of Sanabil\u2019s several \nSDGT funders, its own eventual designation, its highly \nsuspicious conduct (converting \u201cdonations\u201d into cash), \n7.\u2002 The U.S. designated CBSP, Interpal, Sanabil, and AAF \nin 2003 and the Union of Good in 2008. \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0543, 553.\n\nAppendix J\n277a\nand BLOM\u2019s willingness to support Hamas entities, it is \nmore than plausible that discovery will establish that that \npost-designation transfer is not the only one of its kind.\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs argued that BLOM, like LCB, \nwould have \u201cinvestigated the organizations receiving \nthe large transfers, including designations of terrorist \norganizations made by the government whose country \nwas experiencing the terrorism\u201d\u2014Israel.

If this is plausible for a French bank, it is all \nthe more so for a Lebanese bank operating right across \nIsrael\u2019s border.

Kaplan at 866. The error is fatal in both cases.\n\nAppendix J\n279a\nThis Court rejected all of these grounds, explaining \nthat \u201cthe Halberstam third element, .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . concerns \nwhether LCB aided and abetted Hizbollah by knowingly \nproviding assistance\u2014whether directly to Hizbollah or \nindirectly\u2014and whether that assistance was substantial.\u201d \nKaplan at 866. Having found sufficient allegations that \nLCB knowingly assisted Hezbollah affiliates, the Court \nalso found that \u201cit is a permissible inference that LCB \nunderstood that the money in those accounts either \nbelonged to Hizbollah, or would be received by Hizbollah, \nor would be paid out as directed by Hizbollah.\u201d Id. The \nCourt found \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d sufficiently substantial \n(as are the banking services themselves: \u201cHizbollah needs \nbanking services .\u00a0.\u00a0. if it is to successfully carry out \nterrorist attacks,\u201d id. at 848).9 However, the \u201cculpability\u201d \nfor any given amount increases with \u201cthe blameworthiness \nof the tortious act aided or the seriousness of the \nforeseeable consequences.\u201d Id. at 857. It is hard to imagine \na more blameworthy tortious act than terror financing \nor more serious foreseeable consequences than terrorist \nattacks and the murder of civilians.\nHere, Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that BLOM \nprovided substantial services, including transfers worth \nmillions of dollars, for the Three Customers and their \ndesignated transferors knowing they were Hamas-\ncontrolled entities. Sanabil \u201cprovide[d] funding to \nHAMAS,\u201d \u00b6\u00a0590, and even cash Sanabil actually distributed \n9.\u2002 Financial assistance\u2014rather than \u201cencourag[ing] Hamas\u2019 \nviolent activities,\u201d SPA-28\u2014is sufficient.\n\nAppendix J\n280a\nin the refugee camps to recruit and gain public support \n\u201cfrees up other resources within the organization that \nmay be put to violent ends,\u201d Holder, 561 U.S. at 30\u2014such \nas the large sums of money Hamas sent from Lebanon \nto its terror operatives in the Palestinian Territories. \n\u00b6\u00a0587.

BLOM Bank, SAL, No. 20-575-cv \nDear Ms. O\u2019Hagan Wolfe:\nThis letter-brief is submitted on behalf of Defendant-\nAppellee BLOM Bank, SAL (\u201cBLOM\u201d) pursuant to \n\nAppendix K\n283a\nthe Court\u2019s Order of December 17, 2020, in which the \nparties to this appeal were directed to submit letter-\nbriefs addressing how the Court\u2019s anticipated decision \nin Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL (then sub \njudice as \u201cReuvane v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL\u201d) \napplies to this case. The Kaplan decision, issued on June \n9, 2021, confirms that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the \ncomplaint against BLOM should be affirmed.\nThe Facts Alleged Against LCB in Kaplan\nKaplan is the second decision of this Court (the first \nwas Siegel v. HSBC North America Holdings, Inc., 933 \nF.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2019)) to directly address the sufficiency \nof a pleading that asserts an aiding-and-abetting claim \nunder the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2) (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and the first to address \nclaims brought against a Lebanese bank. But that is where \nthe similarities between these two cases end, because \nthe allegations against the Kaplan defendant, Lebanese \nCanadian Bank, SAL (\u201cLCB\u201d), are \u201cfar more specific\u201d \nthan the allegations made here. Oral Arg. Tr. (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 9.1\nIndeed, the allegations here bear no resemblance to \nthe Kaplan allegations. According to the proposed Second \nAmended Complaint (\u201cSAC\u201d) and the incorporated civil \nforfeiture action brought against LCB by the United \nStates in 2011 (\u201cU.S. Forfeiture Compl.\u201d):\n1.\u2002 A transcript of the December 10, 2020 oral argument is \nattached as Exhibit A.\n\nAppendix K\n284a\n\u2022 \tLCB provided banking services to three \u201csubordinate \nentities\u201d of Hizbollah, Bayt al-Mal, the Yousser \nCompany for Finance and Investment, and the Shahid \n(Martyrs) Foundation (the \u201cSubordinate Entities\u201d) \nand to two \u201cindividual leaders\u201d of Hizbollah. Kaplan \nv. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842, 849 \n(2d Cir. 2021).\n\u2022 \t\u201c[F]or \u2018several year[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. prior\u2019 to the\u201d 2006 terrorist \nattacks at issue in Kaplan, Hizbollah had \u201c\u2018openly, \npublicly, and repeatedly acknowledged\u2019\u201d that the \nSubordinate Entities \u201c\u2018were integral constituent parts \nof Hizbollah.\u2019\u201d Id. at 864 (quoting SAC \u00b6\u00a078).\n\u2022 \tOne of the Subordinate Entities was \u201cknown to subsidize \nthe families of Hizbollah suicide bombers\u2014and indeed \nto provide financial reassurance to \u2018prospective\u2019 suicide \nbombers.\u201d Id. at 858 (citing SAC \u00b6\u00a022; emphasis added \nby the Court).\n\u2022 \tWhen the United Nations \u201creported in 2002 that an \nLCB customer was engaged in money laundering \nfor Hizbollah .\u00a0.\u00a0. LCB responded to that report by \nasserting that the report was Israeli propaganda.\u201d Id. \nat 866. LCB then \u201cincreased the permissible amount \nof activity that the U.N. had found constituted money \nlaundering.\u201d Id.\nCritically, unlike here, the banking services allegedly \nprovided by LCB to its Hizbollah-affiliated customers \nwere far from routine. In Kaplan, the plaintiffs alleged \n\u201cthat LCB violated banking regulations and disregarded \n\nAppendix K\n285a\nits own internal policies in order to grant its known \nHizbollah-affiliated Customers \u2018special exceptions\u2019 \nthat permitted those Customers to deposit hundreds of \nthousands of dollars a day without complying with the \nrequirement that the source of funds be disclosed.\u201d Id. at \n858 (citing SAC \u00b6\u00a082 and U.S. Forfeiture Compl. \u00b6\u00a047(g)). \nThose banking regulations were \u201cmeant to hinder the \nability of [Foreign Terrorist Organizations (\u201cFTOs\u201d)] \nto carry out terrorist attacks.\u201d Id. at 865. Accordingly, \nthe Kaplan Court concluded that by pleading that LCB \nallowed its customers\nto deposit large sums in various accounts \nat different LCB branches\u2014totaling more \nthan $2.5 million dollars a week\u2014without \ndisclosing their source, thereby circumventing \nsanctions imposed in order to hinder terrorist \nactivity, the SAC adequately pleaded that LCB \nknowingly gave the Customers assistance that \nboth aided Hizbollah and was qualitatively and \nquantitatively substantial.\nId. at 866 (citation omitted).\nThe Kaplan Decision Reaffirms Linde\u2019s \nInterpretation of Halberstam\nBefore concluding that the SAC pleaded an aiding-\nand-abetting claim under JASTA, the Kaplan panel \nanalyzed the Second Circuit\u2019s prior JASTA precedents: \nLinde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018), \nSiegel and Weiss v. National Westminster Bank PLC, \n\nAppendix K\n286a\n993 F.3d 144 (2d Cir. 2021). Notably, the Kaplan panel \ndid not conclude that Linde departed from Halberstam \nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), when it held that \n\u201caiding-and-abetting liability \u2018requires more than the \nprovision of material support to a terrorist organization.\u2019\u201d \nKaplan, 999 F.3d at 860 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 329) \n(emphasis added in Kaplan). To the contrary, the Kaplan \npanel reaffirmed \u201cthe principle that knowingly providing \nmaterial support to an FTO, without more, does not as \na matter of law satisfy the general awareness element\u201d \nof Halberstam. Id. (citing Linde, 882 F.3d at 329\u201330) \n(emphasis added).\nThe Kaplan panel also reaffirmed, as the Court \nhad held in Linde, that the \u201cmore\u201d required to satisfy \nHalberstam\u2019s general awareness element is \u201c\u2018awareness \nthat one is playing a role in those activities,\u2019\u201d meaning \n\u201cact[s] of international terrorism.\u201d Id. at 859.2 More \nprecisely, when the Kaplan panel concluded that the SAC \nmet Halberstam\u2019s general awareness element, it did so \nbecause the SAC alleged that LCB\u2019s customers \u201cwere \nso closely intertwined with Hizbollah\u2019s violent terrorist \nactivities that one can reasonably infer that LCB was \ngenerally aware while it was providing banking services \nto those entities that it was playing a role in unlawful \nactivities from which the rocket attacks were foreseeable.\u201d \nId. at 860\u201361 (emphasis added).\n2.\u2002 JASTA creates secondary liability only for an \u201cact of \ninternational terrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d)(2). By definition, \n\u201cinternational terrorism\u201d requires \u201cviolent acts or acts dangerous \nto human life.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02331(1)(A).\n\nAppendix K\n287a\nConversely, as the Kaplan panel noted, when the \nWeiss Court affirmed the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \namend their complaint against NatWest, it did so because \nthe record in that case did not show that the bank \u201cwas \ngenerally aware that it was playing a role in Hamas\u2019s acts \nof terrorism.\u201d Id. at 861 (emphasis added); see Weiss, 993 \nF.3d at 166\u201367 (holding that \u201cthe district court did not \nerr in denying leave to amend the complaints as futile on \nthe ground that plaintiffs could not show that .\u00a0.\u00a0. NatWest \nwas generally aware that it was playing a role in Hamas\u2019s \nacts of terrorism\u201d) (emphasis added).3 The Kaplan \npanel\u2019s discussion of Linde and Weiss demonstrates that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability here\u2014that the \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d element of Halberstam is satisfied merely by \nalleging that a defendant has engaged in \u201cconduct relating \nto a terrorist enterprise,\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 41, Tr. at 4, or that it \n\u201cdoes not require more from a pleading than allegations \nof knowingly funding a terrorist organization,\u201d Tr. at \n5\u2014is incontrovertibly wrong. See Weiss, 993 F.3d at 166 \n(\u201cwhether NatWest was generally aware it was providing \nmaterial assistance to Hamas\u2014was established by \nevidence that NatWest was assisting Interpal is contrary \nto Linde and foreclosed by Siegel\u201d).\nKaplan also holds that the third prong of Halberstam\u2014\nwhether the defendant has \u201cknowingly and substantially \nassist[ed] the principal violation\u201d\u2014means that the \ndefendant must \u201c\u2018know[]\u2019 that it is providing \u2018assistance,\u2019 \nwhether directly to the FTO or indirectly through an \n3.\u2002 The opinions in Kaplan and Weiss were authored by the \nsame judge, the Honorable Amalya Kearse.\n\nAppendix K\n288a\nintermediary.\u201d Kaplan, 999 F.3d at 863\u201364 (citations \nomitted). Assistance that is given \u201cinnocently or \ninadvertently\u201d does not meet this prong. Id. at 864. And \ninquiry notice that assistance is being provided to an \nFTO indirectly through an intermediary is not sufficient \nto meet this requirement. Although a complaint may \ncontain \u201cgeneral allegations\u201d of knowledge, plaintiffs are \n\u201crequired to include allegations of the facts or events they \nclaim give rise to an inference of knowledge.\u201d Id.\nKaplan Confirms that the District Court Correctly \nApplied the Second Prong of Halberstam\nThe Kaplan panel reversed Judge Daniels\u2019 ruling \nthat the SAC did not sufficiently allege general awareness \nbecause the SAC identified public information available \nbefore the relevant attacks that connected the Subordinate \nEntities to Hizbollah and also connected the Subordinate \nEntities to Hizbollah\u2019s acts of international terrorism. \nSpecifically, the opinion noted that:\n\u2022 \t\u201c[F]or \u2018several year[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. prior\u2019 to\u201d the attacks at \nissue, Hizbollah had \u201c\u2018openly, publicly, and repeatedly \nacknowledged\u2019\u201d that the Subordinate Entities \u201c\u2018were \nintegral constituent parts of Hizbollah.\u2019\u201d Kaplan, 999 \nF.3d at 864.\n\u2022 \tAn English-language article in December 2004 \n\u201creport[ed] that a \u2018public service message\u2019 by \n\u2018Hizbollah\u2019s television station, Al-Manar,\u2019 \u2018tells families \nof suicide bombers where to go to collect the subsidy \nfrom a martyrs\u2019 foundation,\u2019\u201d one of the Subordinate \nEntities. Id. at 850.\n\nAppendix K\n289a\n\u2022 \tAnother English-language article in March 2005 \nreported that Shahid, the same Subordinate Entity, \n\u201c\u2018supplies charitable funds for Hizbollah-affiliated \nsuicide bombers.\u2019\u201d Id. at 851.\nThe Complaint does not make comparable allegations \nabout BLOM.\nFirst, the Complaint does not contend that Hamas \nbroadcast any affiliation with the Alleged Customers. \nTo the contrary, the Complaint avers that Hamas hid its \nconnections to Palestinian charities.

That secrecy \nis purposeful and dispositive. As explained in expert \ntestimony relied upon by Plaintiffs in their dismissed \ncase against NatWest, Hamas \u201cdoes not publicize its \nassociation with its Palestinian sub-organizations\u201d because \n\u201c[o]therwise, they would be shut down.\u201d Pltfs.\u2019 Resp. to \nDeft.

During \noral argument in this Court, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel pointed \nto a different source\u2014a 2001 FBI report purported to \ndescribe Sanabil as a \u201cknown front\u201d for Hamas\u2014but the \n4.\u2002 The District Court also faulted the Complaint because \nit does not \u201callege any acts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s \nemployees which suggest any awareness on its part of a connection \nbetween any of the Three Customers and Hamas.\u201d SPA20. While \nKaplan holds that the \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d requirement of \nHalberstam \u201cis less demanding than a requirement that [plaintiffs] \nshow awareness,\u201d Kaplan, 999 F.3d at 863, the District Court \nproperly concluded that the Complaint did not allege general \nawareness of a connection between the Alleged Customers and \nHamas. The information linking them was \u201ceither undated or \n[was] dated after the last of the attacks,\u201d and the Complaint did \nnot allege \u201cthat BLOM would otherwise have a reason to review or \nconsider those sources in the course of its operations.\u201d SPA20\u201321.\n5.\u2002 It was not until January 2005 that Israel enacted Financing \nTerror Prohibition Law 5765-2005, which for the first time \nrequired Israeli designations to be published in \u201cReshumot,\u201d the \nofficial gazette of the Israeli government. See Aryeh Greenfield, \nTerrorism and Organized Crime: Full English Translations of the \nPrevention of Terrorism Ordinance 5708-1948, Financing Terror \nProhibition Law 5765-2005, Struggle Against Crime Organizations \nLaw 5763-2003 (Aryeh Greenfield\u2014A.G. Publications 2006) at 13.\n\nAppendix K\n291a\nComplaint itself does not make this allegation.6 See Tr. at \n6. And even if that allegation did appear in the Complaint, \nit is not plausible to infer that BLOM was generally aware \nof an assertion made in an interagency memorandum sent \nby the FBI to the U.S. Treasury Department where there \nis no claim that the memorandum was publicly available \nat the relevant time.\nThird, and critically, the Complaint does not plausibly \nconnect the Alleged Customers to Hamas\u2019s acts of \nterrorism. To the contrary, the Complaint pleads that \nthe Alleged Customers performed charitable work in \n\u201cPalestinian refugee camps in Lebanon\u201d or \u201cin the Beirut \narea\u201d in order to \u201cbuild HAMAS\u2019s support within that \ncommunity.\u201d A154 \u00b6\u00a0588, A161 \u00b6\u00a0624.

See Pls.\u2019 \nBr. 52 at 32 (referring to Boim v. Quranic Literacy Institute, \nNo. 00 C 2905, 2012 WL 13171764 (N.D Ill. Aug. 31, 2012), which \ndescribes the report at *3).\n\nAppendix K\n292a\nThe sole exception is the U.S. designation of Union \nof Good in 2008, which states that the organization \ntransferred funds to \u201cHamasmanaged organizations in \nthe West Bank and Gaza\u201d that used the funds to \u201cprovid[e] \npayments to the families of suicide bombers.\u201d A163 \u00b6\u00a0635. \nBecause this designation was not made until more than \nfive years after the last Attack, it does not give rise to a \nplausible inference that BLOM was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d of \na connection between any of the Alleged Customers and \nacts of international terrorism by Hamas.\nKaplan Confirms that the District Court Correctly \nApplied the Third Prong of Halberstam\nThe Kaplan panel identified three allegations in the \nSAC as supporting an inference that LCB \u201cknowingly \ngave the Customers assistance that both aided Hizbollah \nand was qualitatively and quantitatively substantial,\u201d \nKaplan, 999 F.3d at 866:\n\u2022 \tLCB\u2019s dismissive response to the 2002 U.N. report \u201cthat \nan LCB customer was engaged in money laundering \nfor Hizbollah\u201d Id.;\n\u2022 \tLCB\u2019s decision to \u201cincrease[] the permissible amount \nof activity that the U.N. had found constituted money \nlaundering\u201d and its later decision to \u201callow[] the Five \nCustomers .\u00a0.\u00a0. to conceal their sources of deposited \nfunds totaling nearly half a million dollars per day.\u201d \nId. (citations omitted); and\n\u2022 \tHizbollah\u2019s repeated public pronouncements that LCB\u2019s \ncustomers \u201cwere integral parts of Hizbollah.\u201d Id.\n\nAppendix K\n293a\nNone of the allegations about BLOM in the Complaint \nis comparable. There is no claim that any Alleged Customer \nmade unreported cash deposits at BLOM, no claim that \nBLOM assisted an Alleged Customer in laundering money \n(or any other illegal or tortious activity), no claim that \nBLOM violated banking regulations or its own internal \nguidelines, and no claim that Hamas publicly described \nany of the three Alleged Customers as \u201cintegral parts\u201d \nof its structure.\nCritically, Kaplan underscores that to meet this prong \nof Halberstam, plaintiffs must allege \u201cfacts or events\u201d \ngiving rise to an inference that the defendant had \u201cactual \nknowledge\u201d it was assisting, directly or indirectly, an \nact of international terrorism by an FTO. Id. at 863\u201364. \nThus, where a complaint alleges that the assistance was \nindirect, it must allege (among other things) that the \ndefendant had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the intermediary\u2019s \nconnection to the FTO. Id. The Complaint\u2019s claim that \n\u201cSanabil\u2019s board members were predominantly well-\nknown HAMAS leaders,\u201d supported only by anachronistic \nreferences to their \u201ccurrent\u201d roles or their positions with \n\u201csubsequently\u201d designated organizations, does not meet \nthat test. A155\u2013156 \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0591\u201394.\nNor does the Complaint allege a plausible basis that \nthe alleged assistance was substantial. The Complaint \nasserts that BLOM facilitated the transfer of funds into \nthe accounts of Sanabil and Subul al-Khair and that it \n\u201calso facilitated thousands of small cash disbursements \nthat helped HAMAS purchase support in its target areas.\u201d \n\nAppendix K\n294a\nA160 \u00b6\u00a0613; A161 \u00b6\u00a0628.7 None of those funds is alleged \nto have gone to violent or life-endangering terrorist \nactivities, whether bombs, weapons, or payments to suicide \nbombers\u2019 survivors. Nor does the Complaint provide \nany plausible basis to speculate that some of the funds \nreceived by Sanabil or Subul al-Khair were transmitted \nto Hamas to assist acts of international terrorism; the \nComplaint alleges that that Sanabil made payments \n\u201cindividually .\u00a0.\u00a0. buying loyalty in periodic stipends of \n$40\u2013$50 per quarter,\u201d that Subul al-Khair paid individuals \n\u201cperiodic stipends of $30\u201340 per quarter,\u201d and that these \npayments were made to \u201chundreds (if not thousands) of \nindividual dependents.\u201d A160 \u00b6\u00b6\u00a0611\u201312, A161 \u00b6\u00a0627.

RADINE: Good morning, and may it please the \nCourt. This is Michael Radine of Osen, LLC, on behalf of \nthe plaintiffs/appellants.\nI\u2019d like to begin this morning by focusing on the \ndistrict court\u2019s misstatement of the general-awareness \nstandard set forth in Halberstam v. Welch, which applies to \nJASTA claims. The district court held that plaintiffs must \nallege BLOM\u2019s awareness of a role in terrorist attacks. \nBut the lower court\u2019s decision, which relies substantially \non Kaplan v. LCB, which is currently before this court as \nLicci v. LCB, is incorrect.\nUnder JASTA, a defendant must be generally aware \nthat it is playing a role in violent or [4]life-endangering \nactivities\u2014it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be violent\u2014from \nwhich acts of international terrorism are a foreseeable \nrisk. The standard comes from Halberstam, where the \ndefendant assisted, quote, overall illegal or tortious \nactivity, which there was a criminal enterprise in stolen \ngoods, from which, quote, violence and killing is a \nforeseeable risk. Under JASTA, then, terrorist activities \nor life-endangering activities, as the Court in Linde used \nthose phrases, means conduct relating to a terrorist \nenterprise, not terrorist attacks. Here, the lower court \ndisagreed with Halberstam\u2019s foreseeability framework, \nholding that it is, quote, not enough for plaintiffs to \nplausibly allege that BLOM was generally aware of its \nrole in terrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\n\nAppendix K\n297a\nJUDGE WESLEY: Kind of an interesting\u2014an \ninteresting idea that the district court could disagree with \nHalberstam\u2019s analysis, since Halberstam is specifically \nincorporated into the\u2014into the JASTA framework, isn\u2019t \nit?\n[5]MR. RADINE: Yes. I agree, Your Honor. And, \nindeed, on the next page of its decision, on footnote 8, the \nCourt mentions the passage from Halberstam I quoted a \nmoment before and rejects it as incompatible with Linde. \nBut Linde, of course, explicitly adopts Halberstam and \ndoes not require more from a pleading than allegations of \nknowingly funding a terrorist organization. Indeed, it held \nthat whether, quote, providing routine financial services \nto associates of terrorist organizations is itself a violent, \nlife-endangering act for the purposes of primary liability, \nmuch less playing a role in them for secondary liability, is \na jury question. And that\u2019s Linde at 327.\nSo the result is, the lower court found it dispositive \nthat BLOM had no specific knowledge that these nominal \ncharities engaged in any violent activities themselves, to \nquote the lower court. But BLOM more than plausibly \nknew that they were engaged in life-endangering activities \nand that they were Hamas fundraising institutions. You \ncan\u2019t\u2014\nJUDGE POOLER: Did they know that? Did they \nknow that they were Hamas fundraising [6]institutions? \nDid you allege that in your complaint, and did you have \nany evidence to support that?\n\nAppendix K\n298a\nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor. This is the district \ncourt\u2019s second error. The\u2014the allegations we presented\u2014\nwhich this court is lenient as to the state of mind and takes \nallegations in their totality rather than in isolation\u2014shows \nthat BLOM did know that. Hamas operated openly in \nLebanon and in the Palestinian refugee camps. Hamas \ncreated the three customers, as they\u2019re called. So, for \ninstance, Sanabil, which the FBI in 2001 said was a, quote, \nknown front or supporter for Hamas, created by Hamas \nas its da\u2019wah\u2014is the term\u2014headquarters in Lebanon, led \nby Hamas leadership. And that means Hamas leadership \nat the time, despite BLOM\u2019s suggestion otherwise. That\u2019s \nin our complaint at 591.\nJUDGE POOLER: So is it\u2014is it your argument that \nif BLOM didn\u2019t know, they were willfully ignorant? They \nmade themselves willfully ignorant of these facts that \nyou allege here?\nMR. RADINE: They would have had to have [7]\nbeen. It would have to be a\u2014a decision at that point to \nnot know what was clear, not only from Sanabil\u2019s status \nas a Hamas institution, but where the money was coming \ninto Hamas. Millions of dollars are coming into Hamas \nfrom two organizations that were already designated \nby Israel, and then, of course, from HLF, designated by \nthe United States in 2001, and all this money was being \nconverted into cash. So millions of dollars are coming in \nfrom Hamas\u2019 fundraising network abroad and being pulled \nout in untraceable cash.\n\nAppendix K\n299a\nJUDGE CARNEY: Let me ask. I mean, do the \nallegations support\u2014I mean, the notion that being aware \nof red flags is tantamount to having an intention to further \nterrorist activity, doesn\u2019t Linde suggest that we need to \nhave something more? And Siegel says that less than an \nintention to further that activity is inadequate to support \nliability under 2333.\nMR. RADINE: No, Your Honor. Linde nor Siegel \nrequire intent, and Halberstam as well does not require \nintent. Nothing in JASTA\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: And Halberstam only requires \ngeneral awareness and some degree of [8]foreseeability. \nGeneral awareness that there\u2019s a role\u2014that by\u2014by \nparticipating, that somehow playing a role with regard \nto the terrorist organization in some particular way, and \nthat it\u2019s foreseeable from that role that, indeed, terrorist \nactivity might arise. They don\u2019t have to have a specific \npurpose and/or awareness of that it\u2014that they\u2019re assisting \nterrorist activity itself, do they, under Halberstam?\nMR. RADINE: No, they don\u2019t. There\u2019s no intent \nrequired, and it was not at issue there. As Your Honor \nsaid, the question is the awareness of the role in terrorist \nactivities from which violence is foreseeable. As the \nsupreme court found in Holder v. Humanitarian Law \nProject, support for terrorist organizations results in \nviolence. The phrase was, facilitates more terrorist \nattacks.\n\nAppendix K\n300a\nAnd that would be clear here, to BLOM moving \nmillions of dollars into the area, which is then pulled out \nin cash. Cash, which they admit at Page 32 of their brief, \nthey don\u2019t have visibility on the use for that cash; they \njust see it leaving the account in the [9]untraceable cash.\nWe know from the treasury designation, though, that \nSanabil was using that cash to, quote, provide funding to \nHamas, in addition to its recruiting efforts in the camps \nand elsewhere.\nJUDGE WESLEY: In Licci you have fairly specific \nallegations with regard to some of the customers and \ntheir specific activities as the treasury of Hezbollah. So \nthe customers themselves were identified. And the\u2014and \nthe transactions, including the ever-increasing daily \ncash-transaction limits, had some coordination, at least \nas far as your\u2014as your complaint was in that\u2014same law \nfirm here\u2014was concerned in identifying the fact that it \nhad an appreciation that it was going beyond just being \nthe banker for these folks. Isn\u2019t that the case? I mean, \nyou\u2014you had far more specific allegations in Licci than \nyou have here, don\u2019t you?\nMR. RADINE: Yeah. There are more specific \nallegations in Licci; there are allegations that are here that \nare not in Licci. For instance, here, there is the Hamas [10]\nfundraising network that was already designated abroad, \nwhere the money\u2019s coming in from. That particular fact is \nnot in Licci. But here, as in there, Sanabil is designated \nas a fundraising organization for Hamas, as in\u2014as is \nUnion of Good. They\u2019re playing the same roles here. And \n\nAppendix K\n301a\nthat certainly would have been enough for the bank to be \ngenerally aware of the role that it\u2019s in.\nThey\u2019re all\u2014the defense is essentially the same, \nwhich is that these entities call themselves charities \nor commercial operations, but, of course, that can\u2019t be \nimmunizing under the statute. Providing that support \nto an FTO is enough, as a pleading matter, certainly, to \nmeet JASTA.\nAnd I see I\u2019m over my time here.\nJUDGE POOLER: Okay. Counselors\u2014counselors, \nare you both aware of a case entitled Reuvane versus \nLebanese Canadian Bank?\nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUDGE POOLER: You\u2019re aware of that, that\u2014\nMR. RADINE: Yes.\nJUDGE POOLER:\u2014that was argued last [11]\nNovember?\nMR. RADINE: Yes. Also\u2014also called Licci, that \nJudge Wesley referred to a moment ago.\nJUDGE POOLER: Thank you.\nI\u2019m sorry, Judge Carney. Did you have a question?\n\nAppendix K\n302a\nJUDGE CARNEY: No. No.\nJUDGE POOLER: Okay.\nThank you. You\u2019ve reserved two minutes for rebuttal.\nMR. RADINE: Thank you.\nJUDGE POOLER: We\u2019ll turn to the counsel for the \nbank.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: May it please the Court. Linda \nGoldstein for BLOM Bank.\nThe district court\u2019s decision is faithful to this court\u2019s \nprecedence in both Linde and Siegel, and the arguments \nyou have heard this morning are largely an invitation to \nrewrite those two opinions.\nI will address the three main defects in plaintiffs\u2019 \nargument: First, the incorrect legal standard for the \ngeneral-awareness prong of a JASTA claim; second, \nthe insufficient [12]factual allegations supporting the \nsubstantial-assistance prong in this case; and, third, the \ncontention that the allegations in the complaint are enough \nto allow the case to go to discovery.\nFirst, both Linde and Siegel confirmed that the \ngeneral-awareness prong of a JASTA claim requires that \ndefendant be aware that by assisting the principal it is \nitself assuming a role in terrorist activities, specifically, \nactivities that are violent or life threatening. Neither \n\nAppendix K\n303a\ncase held that it is enough to allege that a defendant was \ngenerally aware that it was assuming a role in financing \na foreign terrorist organization from which it was \nforeseeable that terrorist activities would later result.\nJUDGE WESLEY: Well, let me ask you a question. If \nthere\u2019s a\u2014if a panel of this court were to find that there\u2019s \nan inconsistency between Halberstam and Linde, which \ncontrols?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: There is no inconsistency \nbetween\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: No. Don\u2019t answer\u2014I [13]asked \nyou a question. If the panel of\u2014if this panel were to find \nthat there was an inconsistency between the two, which \ncontrols?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Well, plainly, Your Honor\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: Halberstam controls, does it not?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN:\u2014JASTA says that\u2014that\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: Does not\u2014excuse me.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN:\u2014Halberstam provides the \nframework. And so the question is, what is the framework \nthat Halberstam provides. And my position, Your Honor, \nis that Linde is fully consistent with Halberstam. And if \nyou let me explain\u2014\n\nAppendix K\n304a\nJUDGE WESLEY: Well, don\u2019t you\u2014doesn\u2019t it trouble \nyou the district court found that Halberstam was wrong \nor that Linde was right?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Um, I\u2014number one, Your Honor, \nI don\u2019t believe that that is what the district court held.\nJUDGE WESLEY: Okay.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: But if I could point out, the very \nfirst paragraph of Halberstam\u2019s legal [14]analysis at \npage 476 of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion explains that the \ncase addresses two separate questions: First, whether \nHalberstam was subject to vicarious liability for her \npartner\u2019s burglaries\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: Right.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN:\u2014and, if so, whether the scope of \nthat liability included a murder committed by her partner \nduring the course of one of those burglaries.\nJUDGE WESLEY: Uh-huh.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: The opinion\u2019s reference to \nforeseeability arises only in connection with the second \nquestion and not the first. In other words, the foreseeability \nof the murder played no role in the Court\u2019s analysis \nwhether Halber-\u2014Hamilton was subject to vicarious \nliability for the burglary. That first question was answered \npurely with reference to Hamilton\u2019s knowledge of Welch\u2019s \n\nAppendix K\n305a\nproperty crimes at night and her role in processing the \nproceeds of those crimes.\nBy analogy, under JASTA, a defendant must be found \nvicariously liable for one act of international terrorism \nbefore the [15]foreseeability of other consequences can \ncome into play. Judge Matsumoto clearly applied the \ncorrect legal standard for general awareness when she \nfollowed this court\u2019s decisions in both Linde and Siegel. \nIt\u2019s not just one case; it\u2019s both.\nIf I might also point to the statute, Your Honor, the \nstatute creates aiding-and-abetting liability for acts of \ninternational terrorism. By statutory definition, that \nrequires violence or life-threatening activity.\nHalberstam, by contrast, was a survey of common-\nlaw, aiding-and-abetting, and conspiracy liability. And \nthe Court was clear that the analysis was meant to cover \na broad range of torts, not just torts resulting in physical \ninjury. But the\u2014but the analysis specifically refers in \nnumerous points to aiding-and-abetting liability for \nsecurities-fraud claims, which, obviously, would not involve \nviolence or life-threatening activity.\nSo what the Courts did in Linde and again in Siegel \nwas take that middle prong of Halberstam, which refers to \nillicit or tort\u2014sorry\u2014illegal or tortious activity and [16]\nreplaced it with the words of JASTA, which is terrorist \nactivity. And the sine qua non of terrorist activity is \nviolent or life-threatening acts. And that is why Linde and \nSiegel both correctly applied the Halberstam framework, \n\nAppendix K\n306a\nwhich is what the statute requires, to the particulars of \na claim under JASTA for vicarious liability under the \nAnti-Terrorism Act.\nIf I might move on to substantial assistance. \nSubstantial assistance in this part\u2014case are particularly \nflimsy. The only allegations against BLOM are that it \nprocessed deposits into the accounts of Sanabil and Subul \nAl-Khair, and that it facilitated distribution of small cash \npayments to Palestinian refugee camps living in Lebanon, \nnot in the West Bank or Israel, which is where all of the \nattacks are alleged to have occurred. That is what the \ncomplaint says.\nThere can be no speculation that the cash somehow \nwent somewhere else. The complaint says that the cash \nwent to those refugees in the camps in Lebanon, and there \nis no allegation that either Sanabil or Subul [17]Al-Khair \nwere themselves involved in violent or life-threatening \nactivities\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: Excuse me.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN:\u2014there is no allegation that any \nof the people that got that money engaged in violent or \nlife-threatening activity, and there is no allegation that \nany of the funds transmitted to Sanabil or Subul Al-Khair \nmade their way to Hamas.\nJUDGE WESLEY: Excuse me. Excuse me. Is there\u2014\nwas Sanabil designated prior to\u2014\n\nAppendix K\n307a\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: No. No.\nJUDGE WESLEY:\u2014as a customer by Israel?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: No. Sanabil\u2014Sanabil was \ndesignated by Israel\u2014that was not public. The complaint \ndoes not allege that that was publicly available. And, in \nfact, I tried very hard to find it. My library staff couldn\u2019t \nfind it anywhere other than on\u2014on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s \nwebsite. Israel enacted a law in 2005, four years after \nthe last of the attacks in this case, which for the first \ntime allowed those designations to be posted on a website \nthat banks could consult. But before 2005, they were not \ngenerally available, so [18]there\u2019s no basis to surmise\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: So you take\u2014\nMS. GOLDSTEIN:\u2014that BLOM had any idea that \nthey were there.\nJUDGE WESLEY: You take umbrage with\u2014with \nyour opponent\u2019s indication earlier, that he\u2014he said there \nwas a designation of Sanabil prior, as early as 2001?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: The U.S. Government did not \ndesignate Sanabil until August 22nd\u2014\nJUDGE WESLEY: I didn\u2019t say that. I\u2014\nMS. GOLDSTEIN:\u20142003. That\u2019s just incorrect, Your \nHonor.\n\nAppendix K\n308a\nJUDGE WESLEY: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nJUDGE POOLER:\u2014to interrupt. Wasn\u2019t there\u2014\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: The Israeli designation was \nearlier, but that was not\u2014that was not public.\nJUDGE POOLER: Wasn\u2019t there evidence that some \nof the money from BLOM Bank was used to pay survivors \nof\u2014of suicide bombings?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: That\u2019s not the case, Your Honor. \nThere\u2019s no allegation of that. There\u2019s [19]no allegation that \neither Sanabil or Subul Al-Khair, the only two customers \nalleged to have received funds in the complaint, ever made \nsuch payments. And so that is one of the reasons, Your \nHonor, that discovery of BLOM\u2019s knowledge is really \nirrelevant, because there isn\u2019t even an allegation that \nthat\u2019s what Sanabil and Subul Al-Khair did.\nSo when BLOM received a payment\u2014a transfer to \na Sanabil account that is expressly designated \u2018help for \norphan children\u2019 and what Sanabil does is give money to \norphan children, there\u2019s no reason for BLOM to be at all \nsuspicious of that.\nJUDGE CARNEY: Wasn\u2019t there\u2014wasn\u2019t there one \nincident where the Sanabil account received extensive \nregular transfers from the Holy Land Foundation until \nSeptember 2001, and the first terrorist attack occurred \non December 1, and the Holy Land Foundation was then \ndesignated a\u2014an SDGT on December 3? Now, putting \n\nAppendix K\n309a\nthose facts together, isn\u2019t it reasonable to infer\u2014or that \nthe bank was at least put on notice that that\u2019s what was \ngoing on in that account?\n[20]MS. GOLDSTEIN: Well, number one, Your Honor, \nthe standard is not inquiry notice; the standard is actual \nknowledge. The statute says\u2014\nJUDGE CARNEY: General awareness, not\u2014\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the statute requires \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, number \none. Number two, Your Honor, the last transfer from \nHLF, as you indicated, was in September of 2001, and \nthe designation took place in December of 2001. And the \ncomplaint does not allege nor am I aware that a bank \nhas any obligation to retrospectively investigate\u2014not \na customer, because HLF was not a customer, Your \nHonor; HLF was a transferor to a customer. And there\u2019s \nno allegation that that is standard banking procedure \nfor a bank to go back to its books and look at all of the \nincoming transfers that were made to all of its customers \nto determine if one of those customers\u2014one of those \ntransferors was later designated. So that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not a \nred flag.\nThe essential allegations in this case, Your Honor, are \nsubstantially weaker than those [21]in Siegel, where this \nCourt held that substantial assistance was lacking where \nHSBC was alleged to have provided millions of dollars to \nits customer, Al-Rajhi Bank. But the complaint offered \nat least conclusory allegations that Al-Qaeda in Iraq had \nreceived those funds.\n\nAppendix K\n310a\nHere, there isn\u2019t even that, because there is no \nallegation in the complaint that either Sanabil or Subul \nAl-Khair sent any funds on to Hamas.\nJUDGE WESLEY: Your\u2014\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: And the entire argument depends \nnot even on alter-ego allegations, because the word \u2018alter \nego\u2019 does not appear in the complaint and the word \u2018alias\u2019 \ndoes not appear in the complaint.\nJUDGE POOLER: I\u2019m sorry. I believe Judge Wesley \nhas a question.\nJUDGE WESLEY: No. That\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t\u2014I \ndon\u2019t want to interfere with counsel\u2019s argument.\nGo ahead.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor. \nJUDGE WESLEY: So am I.\n[22]MS. GOLDSTEIN: But my point is, the complaint \nmerely conflates the two. And if this Court\u2014if the district \ncourt were to make an alter-ego finding, it would have \nto meet the legal standard based on facts alleged in the \ncomplaint. And that was not done here.\nThe legal standard is quite clear. Your Honor Judge \nWesley recognized it in the\u2014in the Kirschenbaum case: \nIt has to be when one entity so dominates and controls \n\nAppendix K\n311a\nanother that they must be considered principal and agent, \nand this is shown by proving significant and repeated \ncontrol over the alleged agent\u2019s day-to-day operations. \nAnd that was\u2014that was not shown here. That defect is \ncritical, because without that alter ego\u2014\nI\u2019m sorry, Judge Pooler?\nJUDGE POOLER: I said your time has expired. Can \nyou just wind up?\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yeah.\nTwo points, if I may, Your Honor, just to finish up \non alter ego, that without that alter-ego allegation, the \nonly substantial assistance that BLOM is alleged to have \nprovided here is facilitating the distribution [23]of funds \nby Sanabil and Subul Al-Khair to refugees in camps in \nLebanon, not in Israel or the West Bank. And there\u2019s \nno allegation that any of those funds were used to fund \nterrorists.\nIf I can quickly address\u2014address\u2014address the \ndiscovery issue, Your Honor. They say that they need to get \ndiscovery from BLOM to cure their defective allegations; \nthose defects can\u2019t be cured by discovery from BLOM. \nThe alter-ego defects, information about the relationship \nbetween Sanabil and\u2014or, Subul Al-Khair and Hamas \ncan\u2019t be cured by discovery from BLOM. Whether it was \nwell known in Lebanon that Sanabil and Subul Al-Khair \nwere associated with BLOM can\u2019t be determinant\u2014I \nmean, with Hamas; pardon me\u2014can\u2019t be determined by \ndiscovery from BLOM.\n\nAppendix K\n312a\nJUDGE POOLER: Thank you. Thank you, counsel.\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Your Honor. \nJUDGE POOLER: Mr. Radine, you have two minutes \nfor rebuttal.\nMR. RADINE: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a few \nquick points.\n[24]First, as to the money going to refugees, that\u2019s \nwhat Sanabil claims. FTOs claim charitable uses for their \nmoney; BLOM didn\u2019t have visibility on that. And, of course, \nit was the finding of Treasury that what Sanabil did was \nprovide funding to Hamas.\nSecond of all, the reference to HLF. The argument \nthat a bank shouldn\u2019t have to check all of its customers\u2019 \naccounts doesn\u2019t hold up when it\u2019s in terms of the customers \nwho are known Hamas institutions. When an organization \nwas openly created by Hamas, that is an account that a \nbank would be expected to check and see the millions of \ndollars coming in from HLF, an organization that was \ndesignated for, in part, paying families of suicide bombers.\nFinally, as to\u2014as to the Halberstam standard, of \ncourse, it does not require knowledge in the violence. The \nline is: \u201cFor Hamilton\u2019s aiding and abetting the murder, it \nwas enough that she knew she was involved in some type \nof property\u2014personal-property crime at night\u2014whether \nas a fence, burglar, or armed robber made no difference\u2014\n\nAppendix K\n313a\nbecause violence and killing is a foreseeable risk in [25]\nany of those enterprises. The standard under JASTA \nisn\u2019t different. The phrase \u2018terrorist activities\u2019 is not in \nJASTA; that was a phrase from Linde that is referring to \nthe overall tortious or illegal enterprise in Halberstam, \nfrom which violence is a foreseeable result.\nFinally, I\u2019d add that the Siegel case here is particularly \ninapposite, where the plaintiffs failed to allege that any \ntransfers for an FTO passed through HSBC at all. HSBC \nheld no account for an FTO or an FTO front or alter ego \nor what have you.\nThat\u2019s my time. Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUDGE POOLER: Thank you both. Thank you both \nfor lively argument. We\u2019ll reserve decision.\nAnd I inform you that Reuvane versus Lebanese \nCanadian Bank was argued in November, and we may very \nwell wind up holding this case for the decision in that case.\nThank you.\nMR. RADINE: Thank you, Your Honor. \n(RECORDED PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDE)\n*\u00a0*\u00a0*\n\nAppendix K\n314a\n[26]STATE OF FLORIDA\nCOUNTY OF SARASOTA\nI, JULIA M.

Matsumoto, U.S.D.J \nUnited States District Court, E.D.N.Y. \n225 Cadman Plaza East \nBrooklyn, New York 11201\nRe: Honickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, \nNo. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \nDear Judge Matsumoto:\nPlaintiffs respectfully submit this request for a pre-\nmotion conference to move, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a) and 60(b)(6), to vacate the judgment and for leave \nto file an amended complaint. Vacatur and amendment \nare appropriate here because the Second Circuit (1) \nheld that the pleading standards this Court applied in \n2 University Plaza, \n   Suite 402, \nHackensack, NJ 07601\nT. 201.265.6400 \nF. 201.265.0303\n1441 Broadway, Suite 6022, \nNew York, NY 10018\nT.212.354.0111\n\nAppendix L\n316a\nits dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim \nwere incorrect, affirming the dismissal only on a narrow \nground\u2014premised on a pleading standard not used by this \nCourt\u2014and (2) identified specific types of allegations that \ncould cure Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading deficiencies. Honickman \nv. Blom Bank SAL, No. 20-575, \u2014\u2013 F.4th \u2014\u2013, 2021 \nWL 3197188 (2d Cir. July 29, 2021). Furthermore, while \nHonickman was pending, the Second Circuit also decided \nKaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 \n(2d Cir. 2021), which also identified types of allegations \nsufficient to plead a JASTA aiding and abetting claim.\nThe Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice \nbecause Plaintiffs declined the opportunity to amend at \nthe pre-motion conference for BLOM\u2019s motion to dismiss, \nwhich declination they confirmed at oral argument. But \nany such amendment at that time would have been futile\u2014\nboth the pleading standard for knowledge and the aiding \nand abetting elements under JASTA that this Court \nrequired Plaintiffs to meet were incorrect; indeed, the \nCircuit noted that correctly meeting the JASTA standard \nwas difficult before Kaplan and Honickman were issued: \n\u201cWe acknowledge that the district court\u2019s decision came \nbefore our opinion in Kaplan clarified the import of our \nearlier JASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which \nmay have generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Honickman, 2021 WL 3197188, at *6 n.11.\nFurther, while the Honickman and Kaplan appellate \ndecisions do not provide \u201cminimum\u201d necessary allegations \nfor pleading JASTA aiding and abetting claims, they \n\nAppendix L\n317a\neach identify types of allegations that help support such \nclaims. As shown in the attached proposed complaint, \nPlaintiffs can provide the types of allegations that the \nSecond Circuit has found sufficient. This Court should \ngive Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet what the Circuit \ncalled the \u201ccorrect standard.\u201d Id. at *1.\nI. \t The Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Court\u2019s \nDismissal Decision\nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d with Plaintiffs] that \nthe court did not apply the proper standard.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Id. at \n*1. Specifically, the Second Circuit clarified that each \nstandard this Court applied as grounds for dismissal was \nerroneous, including for alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of \nits customers\u2019 affiliations with Hamas, as well as to the \ngeneral awareness and substantial assistance elements, \nwhich \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abetting \ncases.\u201d Id. at *5.\nThe Second Circuit affirmed the judgment solely \non one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 aiding-\nand-abetting claim fails because the allegations do not \nsupport an inference that BLOM Bank was aware of the \nThree Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the relevant \nattacks.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Id. at *10. Although this Court came to the \nsame conclusion, the Second Circuit specifically rejected \nthe standard \u201cthe district court\u201d applied to Plaintiffs\u2019 \nknowledge allegations: \u201c[A]s we explained in Kaplan, \nPlaintiffs did not need to allege that BLOM Bank \nknew or should have known of the public sources at the \n\nAppendix L\n318a\npleading stage. See 999 F.3d at 865. Such a requirement \nat this juncture would be too exacting.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded).\nThis Court\u2019s error resulted from its reliance on the \nKaplan lower court\u2019s annunciation of the same, erroneous \nstandard. In vacating Kaplan, the Second Circuit clarified \nthat \u201c[a] complaint is allowed to contain general allegations \nas to a defendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff \nrealistically cannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s \nactual state of mind.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .\u00a0 .\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations \nomitted). Accordingly, although the lower Kaplan court \nhad focused on the lack of allegations \u201cthat [LCB] read or \nwas aware of [English-language publication] sources,\u201d it \nwas in fact required \u201cto accept as true the above factual \nallegations as to the repeated multimedia statements by \nHizbollah, to consider all of the complaint\u2019s allegations, \nrather than considering each in isolation, and to accept as \ntrue all permissible inferences that could be drawn from \nthe complaint as a whole.\u201d Id. at 865. This correction is \ncritical because while Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed complaint adds \nnumerous allegations and cites various publications and \nwebsites in English, French and Arabic\u2014all of which \nadd to the \u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM Bank\u2019s \nknowledge in the relevant period\u2014those allegations would \nnot have satisfied the \u201cread or was aware of\u201d requirement \npreviously adopted by this Court. Honickman, 432 \nF.\u00a0Supp. 3d at 267.\n\nAppendix L\n319a\nII. \tPlaintiffs Did Not Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Before\nPlaintiffs may seek to amend their complaints post \njudgment to address pleading deficiencies identified in the \ndismissal or other case law. However, \u201c[a]s a procedural \nmatter, \u2018[a] party seeking to file an amended complaint \npost judgment must first have the judgment vacated or \nset aside pursuant to [Rules] 59(e) or 60(b).\u2019\u201d Williams v. \nCitigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting \nRuotolo v. City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. \n2008)). The Second Circuit has repeatedly \u201cstated that \u2018in \nview of the provision in rule 15(a) that leave [to amend] \nshall be freely given when justice so requires, it might \nbe appropriate in a proper case to take into account the \nnature of the proposed amendment in deciding whether \nto vacate the previously entered judgment.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting \nRuotolo, 514 F.3d at 19 1) (some quotation marks omitted). \nSee also Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. of Iran v. M/T Stolt Sheaf, \n930 F.2d 240, 244-45 (2d Cir. 1991); Indiana Pub. Ret. \nSys. v. SAIC, Inc., 818 F.3d 85, 92 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cSAIC\u201d).\nIn evaluating a post judgment motion to replead, \nWilliams looked to Foman v. Davis, in which the Supreme \nCourt reversed denial of a motion for post judgment \namendment, explaining that \u201cRule 15(a) declares that leave \nto amend \u2018shall be freely given when justice so requires\u2019; \nthis mandate is to be heeded. If the underlying facts or \ncircumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper \nsubject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity \nto test his claim on the merits.\u201d Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. \n178, 182 (1962) (citation omitted). Further, \u201cFoman makes \n\nAppendix L\n320a\nunmistakably clear there is no such rule\u201d that plaintiffs \nmust replead prior to judgment. Williams, 659 F.3d at 214. \nThus, the Williams court reversed the denial of vacatur \nand amendment despite the fact that the plaintiff never \npreviously sought to amend the relevant claims, just as \nin Foman. See also SAIC, 818 F.3d at 91 (permitting \namendment even though the \u201c[p]laintiffs elected to forgo \namending their complaint to replead\u201d some of the claims \nuntil after judgment).\nWhile repeated refusals to amend the complaint in \nways that could have cured the complaint\u2019s deficiencies \nweigh against that liberal standard, see Metzler Inv. Gmbh \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 145-46 (2d \nCir. 2020), here Plaintiffs could not have pleaded what \nBLOM\u2019s employees read or which notice events constituted \nactual knowledge. Because these \u201cdeficiencies\u201d were not \ncurable until the Second Circuit clarified the pleading \nstandard, this motion presents the first opportunity \nPlaintiffs have to meaningfully amend their complaint.\nIII. Plaintiffs Should Be Given the Opportunity to Meet \nthe \u201cCorrect Standard\u201d\nIn Honickman, the Second Circuit identified \ndeficiencies in Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under the correct \nstandard, which Plaintiffs can meet, including, among \nothers:\n\u2022 \tAn account BLOM held for a Union of Good member \norganization during the relevant period that advertised \nits affiliation with, and fundraising efforts on behalf of, \n\nAppendix L\n321a\nthe Union of Good, and its program of sending money to \nthe Palestinian Territories to support \u201cjihad\u201d to defeat \nIsrael and the \u201cAmerican Jew\u201d;\n\u2022 \tIsraeli designations were publicized in the international \npress during the relevant period;\n\u2022 \tPublications showing that \u201cat the time of the interviews \nin which al-Qaradawi\u2013\u2013who chaired Union of Good\u2013\u2013\npraised martyrdom and criticized the United States\u2019 \ndesignation of Hamas, it was public knowledge that \nSheikh al-Qaradawi chaired Union of Good\u201d;\n\u2022 \tBLOM purporting to follow the same FATF/\nMENAFATF rules for preventing terror financing \nthat LCB did, see Kaplan, 999 F.3d at 849, including \nincreased scrutiny of cash transactions and reviewing \ntransferors (i.e., non-customers like HLF and Al-Aqsa \nFoundation) and other indicia of terror financing.\n\u2022 \tDespite its use of \u201ccover\u201d abroad, HAMAS associates \nwith its charities openly in Lebanon.\n\u2022 \tThe Three Customers took the suspicious step of \nwithdrawing considerable funds in cash, which avoids \nthe scrutiny legitimate charities are subject to.\nThese allegations meet the Second Circuit\u2019s knowledge \npleading standard, as well as the \u201cclosely intertwined\u201d \nelement the Second Circuit did not reach. Honickman, \n2021 WL 3197188, at *10.\n\nAppendix L\n322a\nPlaintiffs propose the following briefing schedule for \ntheir motion: Plaintiffs\u2019 Opening Brief by August 20, 2021, \nBLOM\u2019s Opposition by September 10, 2021, and Plaintiffs\u2019 \nReply by September 24, 2021.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Michael J.

P. 4(k)(1)-(2) because it \nhas transacted business during the relevant period and \ncommitted tortious acts within the United States during \nthe relevant period by transferring funds through the \nUnited States for the benefit of HAMAS.\n6.\u2003 As set forth below, BLOM BANK purposefully \nused its multiple correspondent bank accounts at U.S. \nfinancial institutions, including its accounts at Bank of \nNew York, Citibank NA and American Express Bank Ltd. \nin New York to provide financial services to HAMAS, \nincluding facilitating the transfer of millions of U.S. \ndollars through the United States on HAMAS\u2019s behalf \nor for HAMAS\u2019s benefit.\nTHE PARTIES \nA.\t The Plaintiffs\n7.\u2003\nThe Second Intifada (\u201cal-Quds\u201d or \u201cal-Aqsa \nIntifada\u201d), which broke out in Israel and the Palestinian \nTerritories in September 2000, was a key turning point \nin HAMAS\u2019s history.\n8.\u2003 In the initial weeks of the Second Intifada, large \ndemonstrations were organized in several Palestinian \ncities. On October 12, 2000, a Palestinian mob in Ramallah \nattacked two off-duty Israeli reservists, lynched them, and \ncelebrated their deaths\u2014with much of the scene captured \non camera.\n\nAppendix L\n330a\n9.\u2003 Soon thereafter, HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic \nJihad (\u201cPIJ\u201d), the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine (\u201cPFLP\u201d) and the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ruling \nfaction, Fatah, all launched attacks on Israeli civilian \ncenters, military installations, vehicles, and civilians \nthrough suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, and rocket \nlaunchings, which resulted in the death and injury of \nhundreds of individuals, including numerous American \ncitizens.\n10.\u2003 From September 2000 forward, support by the \nPalestinian public for HAMAS grew steadily.\n11.\u2003 It won elections at Palestinian universities, trade \nunions, and later in municipal elections.\n12.\u2003 For approximately the next four years after \nthe outbreak of the violent conflict, HAMAS launched \nhundreds of terrorist attacks targeting civilians that have \nresulted in the deaths and injury of hundreds of civilians, \nincluding numerous American citizens.\nTHE SHOOTING ATTACK ON \nROUTE #60\u2014JUNE 20, 2003\n13.\u2003 On June 20, 2003, Ahmad Najjar and Farah \nHamad, two HAMAS terrorists, perpetrated a shooting \nattack on Route #60 near the Yabroud underpass, killing \none person and seriously injuring three others.\n\nAppendix L\n331a\nThe Goldstein Family \n14.\u2003 Howard Goldstein was a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Israel when he died.\n15.\u2003 He was murdered on June 20, 2003, while driving \nhis car with his parents on Route #60 in Israel.\n16.\u2003 Howard was driving his parents and his wife \nfrom Eli to Jerusalem where they had stayed the previous \nnight following the wedding of Howard\u2019s son, plaintiff \nDavid Goldstein. Howard and his wife and parents were \ntraveling for a weekend in Jerusalem to further celebrate \nDavid\u2019s wedding (which had taken place the previous \nnight).\n17.\u2003 While Howard was driving, Howard\u2019s father, \nplaintiff Eugene Goldstein, was seated in the front \npassenger seat and Howard\u2019s mother, plaintiff Lorraine \nGoldstein, was seated behind her husband. Howard\u2019s wife, \nplaintiff Michal Goldstein (now Michal Honickman), was \nseated in the rear seat of the car, on the driver\u2019s side, \nbehind Howard.\n18.\u2003 At some point, as Howard was driving, Eugene \nnoticed two individuals on the side of the road near the \nYabroud underpass. As the Goldsteins\u2019 car approached, \nthe men turned and began rapidly firing their guns at the \nGoldsteins\u2019 vehicle.\n19.\u2003 Howard was struck by at least one bullet and \nultimately succumbed to his injuries while driving and \nslumped over the steering wheel.\n\nAppendix L\n332a\n20.\u2003\nAt some point in time, while Howard was \nslumped over the steering wheel, Eugene grabbed the \nsteering wheel and maintained control of the car until it \ncrashed and rolled over, approximately eight miles south \nof where the HAMAS gunmen had opened fire.\n21.\u2003 Plaintiff Michal Honickman, formerly known \nas Mindy Goldstein, is a citizen of the United States and \na resident of the State of Nevada. She is the widow of \nHoward Goldstein.\n22.\u2003 Plaintiff Michal Honickman brings this action \nboth individually and as the legal representative of the \nEstate of Howard Goldstein.\n23.\u2003 As a result of the attack, Michal was injured \nwhen glass fragments from the vehicle\u2019s windows struck \nher body, including her left eye. She also sustained hairline \nfractures of her ribs, bruising, and physical trauma when \nthe vehicle eventually crashed and rolled over.\n24.\u2003 Michal has sustained severe physical injuries \nand experienced severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress having been present during the attack, \nand witnessed the death of her husband, whom she had to \nbury and mourn with her children, while her in-laws were \nhospitalized, all in the context of what had been, prior to \nthat point, a joyous family occasion celebrating her son \nDavid\u2019s wedding.\n25.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff Michal \nHonickman experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss \n\nAppendix L\n333a\nof her husband\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\n26.\u2003 Plaintiff Eugene Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of Florida. He \nis the father of Howard Goldstein.\n27.\u2003 Plaintiff Lorraine Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of Florida. She \nis the mother of Howard Goldstein.\n28.\u2003 Eugene suffered multiple gunshot wounds in \nthe attack.\n29.\u2003 His shoulder blade was fractured, and his lungs \nwere punctured. Shrapnel was lodged in his lung, liver \nand kidneys. A bullet remains stuck between his heart \nand his lungs.\n30.\u2003 These injuries, which caused Eugene immense \npain, were life threatening. Indeed, it was highly \nimprobable that Eugene would survive them.\n31.\u2003 Eugene\u2019s injuries necessitated insertion of a \ntrocar, a metal cylinder used to drain blood from his chest \nand facilitate insertion of a chest tube to maintain suction \nand permit healing of the lung. Insertions of a trocar and \nchest tube are extremely painful.\n32.\u2003\nEugene was unable to see Lorraine for \napproximately five days after the attack and did not have \n\nAppendix L\n334a\nspecific information about her condition. His uncertainty \nabout Lorraine\u2019s condition caused him immense anxiety.\n33.\u2003 As a result of the attack, Eugene still has several \nbullet fragments lodged in his chest. He must undergo an \nx-ray every three months to monitor their condition.\n34.\u2003 As a result of the attack, Eugene has difficulty \nfalling and remaining asleep. He constantly replays the \nimage of the attack in his mind.\n35.\u2003 He blames himself for taking his wife to attend \nhis grandson\u2019s wedding.\n36.\u2003 Lorraine was shot multiple times and severely \ninjured in the attack.\n37.\u2003 She suffered a bullet fragment injury from a \nbullet that clipped the tip of her nose and her left upper \nlip and lodged in her mouth. The fragment necessitated \nintubation and emergency surgery, during which the \nfragment was removed from an area less than an inch \nfrom the carotid sheath, which contains the carotid artery \nand the internal jugular vein. Disruption of either of them \nwould have resulted in her death.\n38.\u2003 At one point during her hospital stay, Lorraine \nwas placed on life support.\n39.\u2003 Lorraine\u2019s chewing muscles were severely and \npermanently damaged, and she could not eat solid food \nfor approximately one year.\n\nAppendix L\n335a\n40.\u2003 She required physiotherapy that encompassed \nuse of a ratchet-like device designed to force her jaws \nopen. It was very painful.\n41.\u2003 Lorraine still requires physical therapy because \nthe scar tissue in her jaw prevents her from fully opening \nit. She still suffers from pain and headaches.\n42.\u2003 She requires bridges (partials) because she \nlost her teeth as a result of the attack, and extensive \nperiodontal and dental work.\n43.\u2003 She was also struck by bullets that entered her \nbody through her left shoulder and right lower neck. The \nresulting wounds caused her excruciating pain at the time.\n44.\u2003 She must also deal with the harmful effects of \nshrapnel that lodged throughout her body, especially in \nher back. She also suffered a shattered nose and septum \nas well as various lacerations.\n45.\u2003 Lorraine had difficulty sleeping because she \nthought about Howard\u2019s death.\n46.\u2003 Eugene and Lorraine remained in Jerusalem \nat Hadassah Hospital for approximately 10 days and \nwere unable to return home when they were discharged \nfrom the hospital because the airline did not give Eugene \npermission to fly due to the poor condition of his lungs.\n47.\u2003 As a result of the attack, plaintiffs Eugene \nGoldstein and Lorraine Goldstein have sustained severe \n\nAppendix L\n336a\nphysical injuries and experienced severe mental anguish \nand extreme emotional distress.\n48.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiffs Eugene \nGoldstein and Lorraine Goldstein have experienced \nemotional pain and suffering, loss of their son\u2019s society, \ncompanionship, comfort, advice and counsel, and severe \nmental anguish and extreme emotional distress.\n49.\u2003 The Goldstein family in New York received notice \nof the attack from two cousins, one of whom saw images \nof the attack on the internet and sent an instant message \nto the immediate family.\n50.\u2003 The Goldstein family sat in horror as they \nwatched images of the attack on the Cable News Network \n(CNN) shortly after the attack occurred. The video \nbroadcast showed Howard, Eugene and Lorraine being \npulled from the wreckage of the car Howard had been \ndriving.\n51.\u2003 Lorraine\u2019s face and hair were covered with blood.\n52.\u2003 Plaintiff Richard Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of New York. \nHe is a son of plaintiffs Eugene Goldstein and Lorraine \nGoldstein and a brother of Howard Goldstein.\n53.\u2003 After learning of the attack, plaintiff Richard \nGoldstein telephoned his sister, plaintiff Barbara \nGoldstein Ingardia, at work and asked her to return home \nimmediately. When she arrived, her extended family was \n\nAppendix L\n337a\npresent. They shared the tragic news that their parents \nand brother had been attacked. Barbara then made plans \nto fly to Israel to care for her parents.\n54.\u2003 As a result of the attack, plaintiff Richard \nGoldstein has experienced severe mental anguish and \nextreme emotional distress caused by the life-threatening \ninjuries to both of his parents.\n55.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, Richard Goldstein \nhas experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss of his \nbrother\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice and \ncounsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme emotional \ndistress.\n56.\u2003 Plaintiff Barbara Goldstein Ingardia is a citizen \nof the United States and a resident of the State of New \nYork. She is the daughter of plaintiffs Eugene Goldstein \nand Lorraine Goldstein and the sister of Howard Goldstein.\n57.\u2003 Barbara left her job and her immediate family \nbehind and traveled to Israel to care for her parents in \nIsrael during their recovery and to mourn the loss of her \nbrother.\n58.\u2003 In addition to grappling with the devastating \nemotional consequences of her brother\u2019s death, she \nwas forced to deal with the uncertainty of her mother\u2019s \nrecovery due to her severe injuries and age.\n59.\u2003 Barbara blames herself for encouraging her \nparents to attend the wedding.\n\nAppendix L\n338a\n60.\u2003 As a result of the attack, plaintiff Barbara \nGoldstein Ingardia has experienced severe mental \nanguish and extreme emotional distress caused by the \nlife-threatening injuries to both of her parents.\n61.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, Barbara Goldstein \nIngardia has experienced emotional pain and suffering, \nloss of her brother\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, \nadvice and counsel, and severe mental anguish and \nextreme emotional distress.\n62.\u2003 Plaintiff Michael Goldstein is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of Florida. He is a \nson of plaintiffs Eugene Goldstein and Lorraine Goldstein \nand a brother of Howard Goldstein.\n63.\u2003 As a result of the attack, plaintiff Michael \nGoldstein has experienced severe mental anguish and \nextreme emotional distress caused by the life-threatening \ninjuries to both of his parents.\n64.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, Michael Goldstein \nhas experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss of his \nbrother\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice and \ncounsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme emotional \ndistress.\n65.\u2003 Plaintiff Chana Freedman is a citizen of the \nUnited States and a resident of the State of New York. \nShe is the daughter of Howard Goldstein and plaintiff \nMichal Goldstein.\n\nAppendix L\n339a\n66.\u2003 Chana and her husband were eating lunch at a \nmall in Jerusalem when they learned that her father and \ngrandparents had been involved in what they believed to \nbe an automobile accident.\n67.\u2003 Chana\u2019s husband received a telephone call from \nhis father informing the couple to go directly to Hadassah \nHospital.\n68.\u2003\nWhen Chana and her husband arrived at \nHadassah Hospital, a social worker informed them that \nChana\u2019s father had died in the terrorist attack.\n69.\u2003 Chana informed her brother, David and his \nwife, who had just been married, of the attack when they \narrived at the hospital.\n70.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff Chana \nFreedman has experienced emotional pain and suffering, \nloss of her father\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\n71.\u2003 Plaintiff David Goldstein is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Israel. He is the son \nof Howard Goldstein and plaintiff Michal Goldstein.\n72.\u2003\nAt the time of the attack, David was at a \nJerusalem hotel awaiting his family\u2019s arrival for weekend \nwedding celebrations when he was notified that something \nhad happened to his parents and his grandparents, and \nthat they had been taken to Hadassah Hospital.\n\nAppendix L\n340a\n73.\u2003 Upon his arrival at the hospital, David learned \nthat his father had been killed in the attack, and that his \nmother and grandparents had been injured.\n74.\u2003 Prior to the attack, David frequently spoke to \nhis father, including on the morning of his father\u2019s death.\n75.\u2003 As a result of Howard\u2019s death, plaintiff David \nGoldstein has experienced emotional pain and suffering, \nloss of his father\u2019s society, companionship, comfort, advice \nand counsel, and severe mental anguish and extreme \nemotional distress.\nTHE JERUSALEM EGGED BUS #2 \nBOMBING\u2014AUGUST 19, 2003\n76.\u2003 On August 19, 2003, Ra\u2019ed Abdul Hamid Misk, a \nHAMAS suicide bomber, detonated explosives on Egged \nBus #2.\n77.\u2003 Twenty-three people were killed and over 130 \nothers were injured in the attack.\nThe Strauss Family\n78.\u2003 Plaintiff Moses Strauss is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of New Jersey.\n79.\u2003 Moses was studying in Israel in 2003 and was \nplanning to return to the United States in April 2004.\n\nAppendix L\n341a\n80.\u2003 At around 9:00 pm on August 19, 2003, he \nboarded Egged Bus #2 in Jerusalem after praying at \nthe Kotel (also known as the \u201cWestern Wall\u201d or \u201cWailing \nWall\u201d).\n81.\u2003 Approximately 15 minutes into the bus ride, \nMoses heard a deafening boom when Misk detonated the \nexplosives on the bus.\n82.\u2003 Moses fell forward as a result of the explosion. \nHis eyeglasses, jacket, hat and cell phone flew off his body.\n83.\u2003 As Moses regained his bearings and realized \nwhat had occurred, he witnessed people screaming and \ncrying, and he saw blood and body parts all around him.\n84.\u2003 His clothes were covered with blood, and his \nhearing was severely impaired.\n85.\u2003 To exit the bus, Moses stepped over bodies, and \nin a state of shock made his way toward his apartment. \nAs he reached the corner near his apartment, he saw a \nfriend, and they went into his friend\u2019s apartment and \ntelephoned Moses\u2019s father, plaintiff Philip Strauss, to tell \nhim Moses had been in an attack, but was alive. After \nmaking the telephone call, the friend drove Moses to \nHadassah Hospital.\n86.\u2003 As a result of the explosion, Moses\u2019s body ached, \nespecially his right ear and hand.

Saad \nAzhari also serves as the Vice-President of the Association \nof Banks in Lebanon (\u201cABL\u201d), a cooperative association \nof approximately 65 banks in Lebanon.2\n507.506.\u2003 During the relevant period (1998-2004), \nBLOM BANK conducted business in the United States \nand in New York through correspondent bank accounts at \nBank of New York, Citibank and American Express Bank.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nI.\t THE ISLAMIC RESISTANCE MOVEMENT \n(HAMAS) \nA.\t HAMAS\u2019s Founding\n508.507.\u2003 Several prominent terrorist organizations \noperate in Palestinian-controlled territory, most notably \nthe Islamic Resistance Movement (\u201cHAMAS\u201d), a \nradical Islamist terrorist organization committed to the \nglobalization of Islam through violent \u201cjihad\u201d (holy war).\n2.\u2002 The association includes, inter alia, Bank Saderat and \nal-Bilad Islamic Bank, both of which were designated SDGTs \nby the U.S. Treasury Department. Although Bank Saderat was \ndesignated in 2007, its membership in ABL was not suspended \nuntil 2014.\n\nAppendix L\n407a\n509.508.\u2003 HAMAS3 was established in the Gaza Strip \non December 10, 1987, shortly following the outbreak of \nthe First Intifada.4 HAMAS announced its founding in an \n\u201cofficial\u201d communique on December 14, 1987.\n510.509.\u2003\nIt represented the culmination of \napproximately 15 years of preparation and organization \nbuilding, led by Ahmed Yassin (also known as \u201cSheikh \nYassin\u201d), the unrivaled leader of what had been the Muslim \nBrotherhood Movement in the Gaza Strip.5\n511.510.\u2003\nAlthough Yassin had been confined \nto a wheelchair throughout his adult life, he worked \nunceasingly for the establishment of HAMAS in the \nGaza Strip. When HAMAS was established in Yassin\u2019s \nhome in 1987, the Islamic Resistance Movement already \nhad a defined ideology and a group of pre-existing \ninstitutions in Gaza, such as Al-Mujama Al-Islami (the \nIslamic Center) founded in 1973, Al-Jam\u2019iya Al-Islamiya \n3.\u2002 HAMAS is an acronym of the Arabic \u201cHarakat al-\nMuqawama al-Islamiya\u201d\u2014Islamic Resistance Movement\u2014but its \nname also means, in Arabic, enthusiasm, courage, zeal for battle.\n4.\u2002 The term \u201cFirst Intifada,\u201d as used herein, relates to the \nviolent conflict that broke out in December 1987 between the \nPalestinians and Israel.\n5.\u2002 The Muslim Brotherhood Movement was established in \nEgypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, and was dedicated to the goal \nof fighting Western influences on Muslim society; ensuring the \nadherence of Muslims to Islamic law (Shari\u2019a); and following the \nrectification of Muslim society, to eventually establish an Islamic \nstate that would expand its rule over the world by means of jihad \nand a call to join Islam.\n\nAppendix L\n408a\n(the Islamic Society) founded in 1976, and the Islamic \nUniversity of Gaza, that were the flagship institutions of \nthe Brotherhood\u2019s civilian social framework\u2014the da\u2019wa.6\n512.511.\u2003 On December 10, 1987, after violence broke \nout in the Jabalia Refugee Camp, Sheikh Yassin invited \nsix of the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza to \nhis home.\n513.512.\u2003 There the group decided on the establishment \nof HAMAS, an organization that would combine terror \nagainst Israel with the da\u2019wa (social welfare activities), \nthrough organizations such as Al-Mujama Al-Islami \nand Al-Jam\u2019iya Al-Islamiya. The seven participants of \nthat group are considered by HAMAS to be its founding \nfathers.\n514.513.\u2003 In an interview reported in the Filisteen \nal-Muslima newspaper in January 1998, Dr. Ibrahim al-\nYazuri, one of the original founding fathers of HAMAS, \noffered a telling description of HAMAS\u2019s philosophy \nregarding charitable giving: \nEveryone knows that the Islamic Resistance \nMovement, HAMAS, is a Palestinian Jihad \nmovement that strives for the liberation of all \nPalestine, from the (Mediterranean) sea to the \nriver (Jordan), from the north to the south, from \nthe tyrannical Israeli occupation, and this is the \n6.\u2002 The word \u201cda\u2019wa,\u201d whose basic meaning in Arabic is \u201cthe \ncall to the believers to shelter beneath the faith\u2014return to the \nfaith,\u201d is used herein to refer to \u201cthe civilian infrastructure of \nHamas.\u201d\n\nAppendix L\n409a\nmain part of its concern. Social work is carried \nout in support of this aim, and it is considered \nto be part of the HAMAS movement\u2019s strategy \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. The HAMAS movement is concerned about \nits individuals and its elements, especially \nthose who engage in the blessed jihad against \nthe hateful Israeli occupation, since they are \nsubjected to detention or martyrdom. The \nmovement takes care of their families and \ntheir children and provides them with as much \nmaterial and moral support as it can. This is \none of the fundamental truths of Islamic work \nand thus represents the duties of the Islamic \nstate .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . The movement provides this aid \nthrough the support and assistance it gives to \nthe zakat (Islamic alms-giving) committees and \nthe Islamic associations and institutions in the \nGaza Strip.\n514.\u2003 HAMAS has a unified leadership structure that \noversees the organization\u2019s complementary political, social \nand \u201cmilitary\u201d components. Notwithstanding HAMAS\u2019s \noutward division into various subordinate entities such \nas social welfare organizations, student clubs, religious \ninstitutions and political operations, these entities are \nintegral, constituent parts of HAMAS itself, and to \nthe extent that these entities have putatively separate \nlegal personalities or corporate forms, that was (and is) \naimed at assisting HAMAS to conduct its criminal and \nterrorist activities using different names and aliases to \navoid reprisal.\n\nAppendix L\n410a\n515.\u2003 In United States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d 467, \n485-86 (5th Cir. 2011), the Fifth Circuit explained how \n\u201cHamas operates political, military, and social branches \nto serve its overall goal to destroy Israel\u201d through \u201cviolent \njihad\u201d:\nHamas\u2019s social wing serves this purpose in \nmultiple ways. It provides social services \nlike education and medical care to the needy \nthrough the operation of schools and hospitals. \nBut it also builds grassroots support for Hamas \nand its violent activities through these same \nmeans. The social wing is crucial to Hamas\u2019s \nsuccess because, through its operation of \nschools, hospitals, and sporting facilities, it \nhelps Hamas win the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of \nPalestinians while promoting its anti-Israel \nagenda and indoctrinating the populace in \nits ideology. The social wing also supports \nthe families of Hamas prisoners and suicide \nbombers, thereby providing incentives for \nbombing, and it launders money for all of \nHamas\u2019s activities. Therefore, aid to Hamas\u2019s \nsocial wing critically assists Hamas\u2019s goals \nwhile also freeing resources for Hamas to \ndevote to its military and political activities. \n(Emphasis added.)\nB.\tHAMAS Rejected the Oslo Accords\n515.516.\u2003 In December 1992, as a result of increased \nterrorist activity perpetrated by HAMAS, the government \nof Israel decided to deport over 350 HAMAS operatives \n\nAppendix L\n411a\nto Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon. The location became a \ntraining camp for the operatives, and an incubator of \nradicalism. This later became known as the \u201cMarj al-\nZuhur Deportation.\u201d\n516.517.\u2003 The Marj al-Zuhur Deportation was a \nformative moment in the history of HAMAS, assigning \nit almost mythical status. It established HAMAS\u2019s status \nas a leading Palestinian political organization and brought \nit to prominence in the Arab and international arenas. \nHAMAS members who were deported to Marj al-Zuhur \nhave a special place in the movement\u2019s history, and quickly \nbecame the most iconic members of HAMAS and the \nleadership of the HAMAS da\u2019wa.\n517.518.\u2003 The international community condemned the \ndeportations, and at the end of 1993, the Israeli Supreme \nCourt ultimately determined that the Government of \nIsrael was compelled to accept the return of the Marj \nal-Zuhur deportees.\n518.519.\u2003 On September 13, 1993, President Clinton \nhosted the signing ceremony in Washington, D.C. for \nthe so-called \u201cOslo Accords\u201d presented by Palestine \nLiberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) Chairman Yasser Arafat \nand Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his foreign \nminister, Shimon Peres.\n519.520.\u2003 The Oslo Accords had several significant \naspects, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from \nparts of the West Bank and Gaza, and the creation of \nthe Palestinian National Authority (\u201cPA\u201d), headed by \nArafat. Under the agreement, the newly-formed PA \n\nAppendix L\n412a\nwould perform the services previously provided by Israel, \nincluding education, health, social welfare, taxation and \ntourism.\n520.521.\u2003 The agreement also included Letters of \nMutual Recognition, whereby the Israeli government \nrecognized the PLO as the legitimate representative of \nthe Palestinian people, while the PLO recognized Israel\u2019s \nexistence and purportedly renounced terrorism, violence, \nand the desire for the destruction of Israel.\n521.522.\u2003\nThe Oslo Accords were not, however, \nuniversally accepted by the Palestinian factions. HAMAS, \nwhich historically did not accept the secular PLO as the \nsole official representative of the Palestinian people, \nrejected the agreement for its recognition of Israel\u2019s right \nto exist. The Oslo Accords contradicted HAMAS\u2019s most \nvalued tenet\u2014the destruction of the State of Israel and \nthe creation of an Islamic state in its place.\n522.523.\u2003 Accordingly, HAMAS pursued a three-\npronged strategy in the early 1990s.\n523.524.\u2003 First, it upgraded its terror apparatus \nby perfecting its bomb-making skills and improving the \ncapabilities of its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam \nBrigades (herein, the \u201cQassam Brigades\u201d).\n524.525.\u2003\nSecond, it intensified its efforts to \nsystematically gain control of pre-existing zakat7 \n7.\u2002 Zakat is a form of alms-giving treated in Islam as a \nreligious obligation, second in importance to prayer.\n\nAppendix L\n413a\ncommittees and other religious and social institutions that \nwould ultimately compete with the PA for the \u201chearts and \nminds\u201d of the Palestinian public in Gaza, the West Bank \nand even the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and \nLebanon.\n525.526.\u2003 Third, it accelerated the development \nof its world-wide fundraising network. While HAMAS \nenjoyed support from wealthy patrons in the Persian Gulf \neven in its prior incarnation as Sheikh Yassin\u2019s Muslim \nBrotherhood branch in Gaza, the Oslo Accords galvanized \nits supporters in Europe, Africa and even the United \nStates.\n526.527.\u2003\nSanabil Association for Relief and \nDevelopment, Subul al-Khair and the Islamic Welfare \nAssociation (Lebanon) were all da\u2019wa institutions in \nLebanon tasked by HAMAS to extend HAMAS\u2019s reach \ninto the Palestinian refugee camps where the organization \nwas competing both with its long-time Palestinian nemesis, \nFatah, and the growing power and appeal of Hezbollah.\n527.528.\u2003 HAMAS fundraisers and other operatives \nlocated abroad are key members of the HAMAS da\u2019wa, \nclosely tied to da\u2019wa and Qassam Brigades operatives on \nthe ground in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well \nas to HAMAS political leaders in Lebanon, Turkey, Qatar \nand elsewhere in the Middle East.\n528.529.\u2003 HAMAS\u2019s fundraising activities became \nthe subject of public knowledge not long after it was \nformed. In 1994, The New York Times reported:\n\nAppendix L\n414a\nHAMAS funding of all its activities is estimated \nby the Israelis at about $30 million a year. It \ncomes from money collected by associations \noperating largely abroad but with ties to the \ninternational Muslim Brotherhood network. \nMoney is also collected from Islamic and \nArab communities in the United States and in \nBritain, the Netherlands and other Western \nEuropean locations.\n529.530.\u2003 Similarly, in 1996, The New York Times \nreported:\nIsraeli, Palestinian and Western intelligence \nofficials say Jordan is a major conduit for much \nof the HAMAS budget, estimated at $70 million \na year, nearly all of it for the social service \nnetwork of mosques, hospitals, schools and \nother institutions that form the movement\u2019s \npolitical base in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n.\u00a0.\u00a0. Jordan, intelligence officials say, is a major \npath through which money reaches the HAMAS \nnetwork of mosques and charities. Jordanian \nintelligence reports indicate that much of \nthe money is coming from the Persian Gulf \nemirates and Saudi Arabia.\n530.531.\u2003\nA Washington Post article in 2001 \nreported that, \u201c[a]ccording to [Sheikh] Yassin, [HAMAS] \ndistributes $2 million to $3 million in monthly handouts to \nthe relatives of Palestinian suicide bombers; \u2018martyrs\u2019 who \nhave been killed by Israelis; and prisoners in Israeli jails.\u201d\n\nAppendix L\n415a\n531.532.\u2003 During this time, emboldened by increased \nsupport and intensified zeal, HAMAS broadened its \noperations from kidnapping and executing people \nsuspected of cooperating with Israel to murdering \ncivilians in Israel. In 1994 alone, HAMAS carried out \nthree separate suicide bombings of buses in Israel, killing \n35 people.\n533.\u2003 The U.S. Department of Justice summarized \nHAMAS\u2019s da\u2019wa and its role in the organization\u2019s \nterrorism:\nWhile Hamas thus engages in many different \nactivities, it is one organization. The social and \ncharitable elements of Hamas are inexorably \nintertwined with the terrorist elements in the \norganization\u2019s overall mission. For example, \nHamas\u2019 charitable network helps it maintain \npopular support, to compete with the Palestinian \nAuthority, and to recruit activists, including \nindividuals for its deadly terrorist attacks. In \naddition, Hamas\u2019 charitable associations serve \nin part as a screen for its covert activities, \nproviding a benign cover through which money \ncan be transferred from overseas into Hamas-\ncontrolled institutions. The overseas funds \nflowing into Hamas\u2019 social and charitable \ninfrastructure free other resources for use in \nterrorist operations.8\n8.\u2002 #\u2002 Final Brief for Appellees, Holy Land Foundation v. \nAshcroft, No. 02-5307, 2003 WL 25586055 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 24, 2003).\n\nAppendix L\n416a\nC.\t The U.S. Government Designated Hamas\n532.534.\u2003 On January 23, 1995, President Clinton \nissued Executive Order No. 12947 designating HAMAS \nas a \u201cSpecially Designated Terrorist\u201d (\u201cSDT\u201d). President \nClinton found that \u201cgrave acts of violence committed by \nforeign terrorists that threaten to disrupt the Middle East \npeace process constitute an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy \nof the United States.\u201d\n533.535.\u2003 Executive Order No. 12947 blocks all \nproperty and interests in property of the terrorist \norganizations and persons designated in the Order, \nincluding HAMAS. This designation made it illegal for \nany United States person or entity to engage in any \nunlicensed transactions or dealings involving the property \nor interests of HAMAS. HAMAS\u2019s designation as an SDT \norganization has remained in place since January 24, 1995.\n534.536.\u2003 HAMAS continued its terrorist activities, \nbombing a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. \nHAMAS claimed responsibility for the bombing, which \nkilled 26 people and injured 80. Six of the victims were \nU.S. citizens. That year, under heavy pressure from Israel \nand the PLO under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, the \nrecently-established Palestinian Authority very publicly \ntook steps against HAMAS as a result of a wave of \nHAMAS terrorist attacks. Over the coming years, the \nPA would, from time to time, attempt to take measures \nagainst the zakat committees and charitable societies run \nby HAMAS. Closures and arrests, however, were always \ntemporary.\n\nAppendix L\n417a\n535.537.\u2003 On October 8, 1997, by publication in the \nFederal Register, the United States Secretary of State \ndesignated HAMAS as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \npursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct and the AEDPA. As a result of this designation, it \nbecame illegal for any person within the United States \nor subject to its jurisdiction to provide material support \nor resources to HAMAS.\n536.538.\u2003 The designation of HAMAS as an FTO has \nbeen renewed every two years since 1997.\n539.\u2003 From the time HAMAS was designated an FTO \n(and indeed in the years preceding its designation), it has \nopenly, proudly, publicly, and repeatedly acknowledged \nand taken credit for carrying out terrorist attacks against \ncivilians in Israel.\n540.\u2003 HAMAS takes credit for attacks on its websites, \nin international media, and elsewhere, as the largest and \nmost prolifically lethal terrorist group operating in Israel \nand the Palestinian territories.\n541.\u2003\nHAMAS has been designated a terrorist \norganization by the European Union, the Organization of \nAmerican States, Canada, Japan, and Israel.\n537.542.\u2003 On October 31, 2001, after the September \n11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, President \nBush issued Executive Order No. 13224, declaring a \nnational emergency with respect to the \u201cgrave acts of \nterrorism .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the continuing and immediate threat of \n\nAppendix L\n418a\nfurther attacks on United States nationals or the United \nStates.\u201d Executive Order No. 13224 designated HAMAS \nas a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d). \nExecutive Order No. 13224 blocked all property and \ninterests in property of the SDGTs, including HAMAS. \nHAMAS\u2019s designation as an SDGT organization has \nremained in place since October 31, 2001.\nD.\t HAMAS\u2019s EuropeanGlobal Fundraising \nNetwork\n543.\u2003 As noted above, HAMAS was an outgrowth of \nthe Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n544.\u2003\nAfter HAMAS\u2019s founding, the Muslim \nBrotherhood directed its worldwide chapters to establish \nso-called \u201cPalestine Committees\u201d to support Hamas \nfrom abroad. As such, Hamas became a focal point of the \nMuslim Brotherhood\u2019s fundraising and political efforts \nin North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n545.\u2003 Prior to the outbreak of the Second Intifada, \nalthough HAMAS\u2019s international network of fundraising \norganizations\u2014the so-called \u201cPalestine Committees\u201d\u2014\nworked closely together and periodically laundered money \nthrough one another, they functioned as largely separate \nentities with a few key HAMAS operatives at the helm \nof each organization.\n546.\u2003 As discussed below, this organization structure \nwas modified after the outbreak of the Second Intifada \nwhen HAMAS\u2019s leadership decided to exploit the \n\nAppendix L\n419a\nhumanitarian suffering it was responsible for creating to \nraise even larger sums of money for HAMAS. It did so by \nbringing together its disparate fundraising organizations \nunder the unified banner of the Charity Coalition or \u201cUnion \nof Good\u201d and using the enormously famous and popular \nSheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi as its \u201cbrand ambassador.\u201d\n547.\u2003\nHowever, in the 1990s, the \u201cPalestine \nCommittees\u201d were first established and began building \nup the fundraising infrastructure for HAMAS in Europe \nand the United States.\n538.548.\u2003 The Comit\u00e9 de Bienfaisance et de Secours \naux Palestiniens (\u201cCBSP\u201d), HAMAS\u2019s primary fundraiser \nin France, was founded in 1990 and registered there as a \nnon-profit organization.\n549.\u2003 It was one of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s first \n\u201cPalestine Committees.\u201d\n539.550.\u2003 The Israeli government declared CBSP \nan illegal organization on May 6, 1997, because of \nits affiliation with HAMAS and the support it gave \nto HAMAS-affiliated institutions, and subsequently \ndesignated it a terrorist organization on January 17, 1998. \nThe Israeli designation of CBSP as an illegal organization \nassociated with HAMAS was widely reported by news \nagencies (see below).\n540.551.\u2003\nInterpal, HAMAS\u2019s most important \nfundraising organization in the United Kingdom, was \nformally registered as a charity with the U.K. Charity \n\nAppendix L\n420a\nCommission on August 11, 1994, under the name \n\u201cPalestinian Relief and Development Fund.\u201d\n541.552.\u2003 As early as 1995, published reports in Israel \nlinked Interpal to HAMAS.\n542.553.\u2003 TheLike CBSP, the Israeli government \ndeclared Interpal an illegal organization on May 6, \n1997 because of its affiliation with HAMAS and the \nsupport it gave to HAMAS-affiliated institutions and \nsubsequently declared it a terrorist organization on \nJanuary 17, 1998. The Israeli designation of Interpal as an \nillegal organization associated with HAMAS was widely \nreported by news agencies (see below).\n554.\u2003 Moreover, a detailed article on March 15, 1996, \nin The New York Times titled \u201cROOTS OF TERROR: A \nspecial report. Alms and Arms: Tactics in a Holy War,\u201d \ndescribed how HAMAS\u2019s da\u2019wa system works and how \nit raised money abroad, noting: \u201cIsraeli officials say that \namong the key Hamas fund-raising operations are the \nHoly Land Foundation of Richardson, Texas and the \nLondon-based Palestine and Lebanon Relief Fund, known, \nfor its telex address, as Interpal.\u201d\n555.\u2003 Similarly, a July 8, 1996, article in U.S. News & \nWorld Report detailed Saudi Arabian funding of HAMAS, \nreporting:\nFrom a spacious headquarters in a warehouse \nnear Jidda Port, the International Islamic \nRelief Organization coordinates a multimillion-\n\nAppendix L\n421a\ndollar campaign to fund communal and social \nwork among refugees and the poor throughout \nAfrica, Asia and the Middle East.\nBut according to Western intelligence sources, \nthe relief organization does much more than \nthat: They believe that the IIRO, one of the \nlargest nongovernmental organizations in \nSaudi Arabia, is a major clearinghouse for \nan estimated $ 20 million a year in Saudi \nfinancial aid to Islamic extremists in Gaza and \nthe West Bank. It\u2019s all a high-risk gamble for \nthe kingdom. Allowing the raising of money \nfor foreign groups that support religious \nextremism and terror, say these intelligence \nsources, could spark even greater dissent \nagainst the Saudi government.\nDangerous liaisons. Much of the aid sent to the \nWest Bank and Gaza, report these sources, \nis given as unsupervised cash grants. The \nfunds are first transferred to London and \nAmman bank accounts of Islamic welfare \norganizations such as the Palestine and \nLebanon Relief Fund (PLRF) and the \nPalestinian Relief and Development Fund \n(Interpal). At least some of that money, \nsay the sources, winds up financing Hamas \nactivities, from funding the families of \nsuicide bombers to bankrolling the suicide \nunits.\n\nAppendix L\n422a\nFarid Y. Gurashi, the general secretary of \nthe IIRO, denies that his organization sends \nsupport to any political group, \u201ceven if it\u2019s a \ngood cause.\u201d But, adds the American-educated \nGurashi, \u201cit would be silly and unacceptable to \nsay we cannot help Palestinians.\u201d\nAccording to a copy of a document obtained \nby U.S. News, officials of a Hamas fund-\nraising group in the West Bank and Gaza \nwere instructed to send letters of thanks to \nthe executives of the IIRO and another Saudi \norganization, the World Association of Muslim \nYouth, for \u201ccharity for this year.\u201d (Emphasis \nadded.)\n556.\u2003 On August 7, 1997, The Guardian (UK) reported \nthat an official Israeli government told the newspaper \u201cthe \ncharity, Interpal, was controlled by Hamas, a militant \nIslamist organisation which Israel believes carried out \nthe suicide-bombing of a Jerusalem market last week.\u201d \nIbrahim Hewitt, an Interpal trustee, was interviewed \nby The Guardian and \u201csaid it was possible that some \nof Interpal\u2019s beneficiaries in the Palestinian territories \nhad been established by Hamas, but argued that Hamas \nruns a social welfare and religious network separate from \nits military wing, Izz el-Deen al-Qassam. \u2018It\u2019s like the \ndifference between Sinn Fein and the IRA,\u2019 Mr. Hewitt \nsaid.\u201d\n557.\u2003 But, as shown below, these evasions have been \nrepeatedly exposed. More importantly, these charity \ngroups operate openly in Lebanon as FTO affiliates in \n\nAppendix L\n423a\norder to reap the political and operational benefits of the \nfunds they distribute.\n558.\u2003 The Al-Aqsa Foundation, one of HAMAS\u2019s \nleading fundraising organizations and also an early \n\u201cPalestine Committee,\u201d established branch offices in \nHolland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Yemen, South \nAfrica, and Pakistan. It was founded in July 1991 in \nGermany (Al-Aqsa e.V.), where it was headquartered, \nand which served as its main branch until at least 2002.\n559.\u2003 On May 6, 1997, Israel outlawed the Al-Aqsa \nFoundation (including its German headquarters).\n560.\u2003\nOn May 21, 1997, Agence France Presse \nreported that \u201cIsrael has banned five foreign-based \nfundraising groups from carrying out activities in the \ncountry or the occupied territories on grounds they \nhelp finance armed Palestinian militants,\u201d and that the \nfive groups included the \u201cPalestine Development Fund \n[Interpal], also based in Britain, the Al-Aqsa Foundation \nin Germany and the Holy Land Fund in the United \nStates.\u201d It also noted that Israeli intelligence officials \naccused the five

We tolerate neither terrorist activities in \nGermany nor organizations that support attacks in foreign \ncountries.\u201d\n573.\u2003 On August 16, 2002, the Associated Press \nreported that police in two German cities carried out new \nraids against the Al-Aqsa Foundation and despite denials \nfrom the organization, \u201cInterior Minister Otto Schily has \nsaid documents found in the group\u2019s headquarters support \nthe government\u2019s belief that the charity was assisting \nHamas, which has claimed responsibility for many of the \nsuicide attacks in Israel.\u201d\n574.\u2003 On August 20, 2002, The Wall Street Journal \nreported on Germany\u2019s actions against the Al-Aqsa \nFoundation in an article titled \u201cReport on al Qaeda \nPrompts German Ban of Islamic Group.\u201d The article \nnotes that the Al-Aqsa Foundation \u201craises money for the \nostensibly humanitarian activities of Islamic militant \ngroup Hamas in the Palestinian territories, but al Aqsa \nalso is accused of sending money to the families of suicide \nbombers.\u201d\n575.\u2003\nFollowing Germany\u2019s ban of the Al-Aqsa \nFoundation in August 2002, the General Intelligence and \nSecurity Service of the Netherlands (AIVD) intensified \nits own investigation into the Dutch branch of the \norganization and published its findings in its annual \nreport for 2002, noting that: \u201cAl Aqsa raises funds in the \nNetherlands for benefit of Palestinian organizations and is \nassociated with the support the radical Islamic Palestinian \norganization Hamas. Unlike Israel and the United States, \n\nAppendix L\n429a\nin Europe only the military wing of Hamas, the al Qassam \nBrigade, is designated as a terrorist organization. In \nthe past, personnel and administrative ties between Al \nAqsa Germany and Al Aqsa Netherlands were detected. \nInvestigation by the AIVD now has [further] indicators. \nIt has been found that funds collected here by the Al \nAqsa foundation have been used for violent activities in \nthe Middle East.\u201d\n576.\u2003 On April 3, 2003, the Netherland Ministry \nof Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs froze the \naccounts of the Al-Aqsa Foundation in the Netherlands \nciting its connection to HAMAS.\n577.\u2003 The Dutch government concluded that:\nThe differentiation between social and \nterroristic activities of Hamas can no longer be \nupheld. Hamas, to which the named fundraising \norganizations are connected has to be viewed \nas an organization facilitating charitable \nservices as well as terrorist acts, whereby these \nactivities mutually complement each other.\nThe Association Al-Aqsa maintains or \nmaintained contacts with institutions raising \nfunds in favor of Hamas.

According to the minister, \nthe Al Aqsa Foundation supports terrorists. \nThe measure, published in the Government \nGazette, takes effect today. Furthermore, it \nis now prohibited to donate money to Al Aqsa. \nBanks are no longer allowed to provide financial \nservices to the foundation.\nIt was already known that Al Aqsa is transferring \nmoney to the Palestinian organization Hamas, \nresponsible for suicide attacks in Israel and the \nPalestinian territories. Al Aqsa leaflets state \nthat money can be deposited in a \u201cmartyrs\u2019 \nfund.\u201d Hamas is also concerned with social \nservices. Until now, the Dutch government took \nthe position that Al Aqsa could not be brought \ndown, because it could not be established \n\nAppendix L\n431a\nthat euros collected here in the Palestinian \nTerritories were used for bombs and not for \nbeds.\nGermany already banned the establishment \nof Al Aqsa in Aachen, after which the General \nIntelligence and Security Service intensified its \ninvestigation and now says it has hard evidence \nthat money from Rotterdam is used directly for \nviolent actions. It is still unknown whether Al \nAqsa will also face criminal charges.\n579.\u2003 On May 29, 2003, the U.S. Treasury Department \ndesignated all branches of the Al-Aqsa Foundation as an \nSDGT pursuant to Executive Order 13224.10\n580.\u2003 The U.S. Treasury Press Release announcing \nAl-Aqsa\u2019s designation stated:\nAl Aqsa is a critical part of HAMAS\u2019 \nterrorist support infrastructure.

HLF paid \nfor Jamil Hamami, HAMAS\u2019s leader in the West Bank, \nto take at least 6 trips to the United States between \nSeptember 1990 and November 1991 so that he could \n\nAppendix L\n438a\nappear as a guest speaker at HLF fundraising events. It \nalso paid for another HAMAS leader, Sheikh Mohammad \nSiam, to travel to the United States and appear at \nfundraisers. These trips followed a decision by then \nHAMAS Political Bureau head Mousa Abu Marzook to \ndesignate HLF as HAMAS\u2019s primary fund-raising entity \nin the United States.\n564.596.\u2003 Since 1995, when it first became illegal \nto provide financial support to HAMAS, HLF provided \nover $12,400,000 in funding to HAMAS through various \nHAMAS-affiliated committees and organizations located \nin Palestinian-controlled areas and elsewhere. In the \nyear 2000 alone, HLF raised over $13 million. An FBI \ninvestigation \u201cdetermined that a majority of the funds \ncollected by the [HLF] are used to support HAMAS \nactivities in the Middle East.\u201d\n565.597.\u2003 This is unsurprising given the close familial \nrelationships between HLF officers and known HAMAS \nleaders in the Middle East. Shukri Abu Baker, the \nCEO of HLF, was the brother of HAMAS leader Jamal \nIssa. HLF\u2019s co-founder, Ghassan Elashi, was related by \nmarriage to Mousa Abu Marzook, while former HLF \nChairman Mohammed el-Mezain was Marzook\u2019s cousin. \nHLF member Mufid Abdelqader was a cousin of Khalid \nMishal, who would later become HAMAS\u2019s external \n(and supreme) leader. Both Mishal and Marzook were \ndesignated SDGTs by the Treasury Department in 2003. \nMarzook was also designated an SDT in 1995.\n598.\u2003 On March 15, 1996, a feature article in The New \nYork Times detailed the financing of HAMAS by so-called \n\nAppendix L\n439a\ncharitable organizations. The article specifically discussed \nIsraeli government claims that Richardson, Texas-based \nHLF was a \u201ckey fundraising operation\u201d for HAMAS and \ndiscussed HAMAS\u2019s social infrastructure.\n599.\u2003 The April 8, 1996, edition of the Dallas Morning \nNews contained an article titled: \u201cPaper Trail Leads to \nHamas; Two Organizations Based in Richardson Deny \nThey Promote Agenda of Anti-Israeli Terrorists.\u201d The \narticle reported that:\nLeaders of the local groups denied affiliation \nwith Hamas.

It is believed that by providing these \nannuities to families of HAMAS members, the \n[HLF] assists HAMAS by providing a constant \nflow of suicide volunteers and buttresses a \nterrorist infrastructure heavily reliant on \nmoral support of the Palestinian populace. \nAccording to [an informant], in the words \nof Shukri Abu Baker, [HLF\u2019s] mission is to \nsupport the families of the martyrs.\n604.\u2003 The U.S. Treasury Department designated \nHLF as an SDGT on December 4, 2001.\n605.\u2003 The U.S. Treasury Press Release announcing \nHLF\u2019s designation stated, inter alia:\n\u2022\t The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and \nDevelopment, headquartered in Richardson, \nTexas, raises millions of dollars annually \nthat is used by HAMAS.

In 1994, Marzook (who was \nnamed a Specially Designated Terrorist \nby the Treasury Department in 1995) \ndesignated the Holy Land Foundation as the \nprimary fund-raising entity for HAMAS in \nthe United States.\n606.\u2003\nThe French daily newspaper Le Figaro \nreported on the U.S. designation of HLF on December 5, \n2001, identifying the organization as accused of funding \nHAMAS.\n567.607.\u2003 In 2004, HLF and several of its directors \nwere indicted on criminal charges that HLF was illegally \nsupporting HAMAS.\n568.608.\u2003 In 2008, a jury found HLF and five of its \nformer directors guilty of transferring more than $12 \nmillion to HAMAS.\n569.609.\u2003 The convictions were affirmed in 2011 by \n\nAppendix L\n443a\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\nF.\t\nHAMAS in Lebanon\n570.610.\u2003\nAlthough estimates vary, during the \nrelevant period Palestinian refugees in Lebanon numbered \napproximately 300,000 and constituted the second-largest \nPalestinian diaspora community.\n571.611.\u2003 Since its inception in 1982, Hezbollah has \nmade steady political inroads within this community.\n572.612.\u2003 For example, Hezbollah has provided \nresidents of the Shatila refugee camp with potable water \nand suppliessupplied diesel for the rundown power \ngenerators.\n573.613.\u2003 However, as a fanatical Shi\u2019a organization, \nthere are intrinsic limits on Hezbollah\u2019s ability to co-opt \nand speak for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, who are \noverwhelmingly Sunni.11\n614.\u2003 Moreover, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon have \na separate (lower) status than Lebanese nationals. The \nvast majority of them cannot obtain Lebanese citizenship \nand they have been consigned to refugee camps and at \nleast during the relevant period, could not easily relocate.\n11.\u2002 In 1999, the CIA estimated that there were over 350,000 \nPalestinians in Lebanon (more than 200,000 living in refugee \ncamps). For various domestic political reasons, Lebanon never \nafforded citizenship to Palestinian refugees.\n\nAppendix L\n444a\n615.\u2003 In December 1992, the Israeli government \ntemporarily deported approximately 415 HAMAS and \nPalestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) members to Marj al-Zuhur, \nLebanon.\n616.\u2003 The Marj al-Zuhur Deportation was important \nto the development of HAMAS because it allowed senior \nHAMAS operatives from Gaza and the West Bank to \nmeet together (in Lebanon) and establish direct contact \nwith the HAMAS leadership abroad, which was taking \nits initial steps at that time. (Previously, it was extremely \nchallenging for HAMAS leaders outside the Gaza Strip to \ncommunicate with or meet with each other due to Israeli \nsurveillance.)\n617.\u2003 The deportation also assisted in unifying the \nHAMAS leadership from different areas and allowed it \nto establish contact with Hezbollah, from which HAMAS \nlearned and adopted terrorist methods such as the use of \nsuicide terrorists against Israel.\n574.618.\u2003 In 1994, HAMAS established Sanabil \nAssociation for Relief and Development, with the unofficial \ngoal of competing with Hezbollah\u2019s social welfare \ninfrastructure and recruiting members for its Izz al-din \nal-Qassam Brigades, the terror apparatus of Hamas.\n575.619.\u2003 Immediately after Israel launched its \n\u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d operation in southern Lebanon in 1996 \nto end rocket attacks on Northern Israel by Hezbollah, \nSanabil distributed more than $l00,000 to the inhabitants \nof the southern regions who had taken refuge in Sidon as \npart of its initial effort to compete with Hezbollah.\n\nAppendix L\n445a\n576.620.\u2003 In late 1999, the Syrian regime authorized \nHAMAS\u2019s political bureau in Damascus and Beirut, \nrepresented by Mousa Abu Marzook and Khalid Mishal, \nto take over the Lebanese Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s networks \n(which had long been publicly active) in the Palestinian \nrefugee camps. (Syria effectively occupied most of \nLebanon at that time.)\n577.621.\u2003 This provided the Syrian regime a way to \nfurther exert control over HAMAS\u2019s leadership outside \nthe Palestinian Territories and served as a means for the \nSyrian leadership to promote Islamists in Lebanon who \nwere primarily focused on attacking Israel rather than \nsettling internal scores within the fractured Palestinian \ncommunity.\n622.\u2003\nAs summarized in a 1999 report by the \nInternational Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in \nIsrael:\nThe \u201cIslamic Jihad\u201d and Hamas maintain a \npropaganda and political presence in Lebanon \nalongside of which they also carry out military \nactivities. The founding of these organizations \nin Lebanon, while cooperating with the Iranians \nand the Hizbollah, was made possible by the \napproval of Syria, which controls what takes \nplace in Lebanon.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nLebanon is an important arena for these \norganizations. They perceive Lebanon as \nan additional important arena from which \n\nAppendix L\n446a\noperational activities in Israel and the \n\u201cterritories\u201d can be conducted, with the \nassistance of friendly organizations, mainly the \nHizbollah. The presence of a large population of \nPalestinian refugees, the position of Lebanon \nas an important communication and financial \ncenter in the Arab world and the freedom \nprevailing there (in comparison to Syria) make \nit also a more convenient political, organizational \nand propaganda center for these organizations.\n623.\u2003 The International Policy Institute for Counter-\nTerrorism in Israel also reported in 1999 that: \u201cIn addition \nto political ties, Iran also provides Hamas with military \nassistance. The movement\u2019s activists train on a regular \nbasis at the camps of Hizbollah and the Guardians of \nthe Revolution in Lebanon, as well as in Iran. This \nincludes training for suicide attacks. Several Iranian-\ntrained militants succeeded in infiltrating back into the \nTerritories under Palestinian Authority control. Israel \nhas arrested Hamas activists who admitted that they \nwere trained by Iranian instructors in the Beka\u2019a Valley, \nin Lebanon, and in Iran. The training included the use of \nlight weapons, photography and sabotage.\u201d\n578.624.\u2003 The emerging presence of HAMAS in the \nPalestinian refugee camps was widely publicized in the \nLebanese press, and for Syria, it provided a way to hamper \nthe progress of the even more radical (anti-Shi\u2019a and anti-\nSyrian) Salafist jihadist groups that were developing in \nLebanon.\n\nAppendix L\n447a\n625.\u2003 The U.S. Department of State Patterns of \nGlobal Terrorism reported in 1998 that\n\u201cSyria grants a wide variety of terrorist \ngroups\u2014including HAMAS, the PFLP-GC, \nand the PIJ\u2014basing privileges or refuge in \nareas of Lebanon\u2019s Beka\u2019a Valley under Syrian \ncontrol.\u201d\n626.\u2003 The U.S. Department of State Patterns of \nGlobal Terrorism reported in 1999 that:\n\u201cThe lack of effective government control in \nparts of Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern \nLebanon enabled numerous terrorist groups to \noperate with impunity, as they had in previous \nyears. Hizballah, HAMAS, the PIJ, the Popular \nFront for the Liberation of Palestine-General \nCommand (PFLP-GC), and other Palestinian \ngroups used camps in Lebanon for training and \noperational planning.\u201d\n627.\u2003 The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Patterns of \nGlobal Terrorism Report for 2000 also confirmed that \nHAMAS had been granted \u201cbasing privileges\u201d by the \nSyrian regime for training and other activities in the \nBekaa Valley.\n628.\u2003 Prior to 2000, HAMAS\u2019s Beirut office was \nheaded by Mustafa Liddawi and was allowed to openly \nrecruit Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. HAMAS was \ngranted virtually unrestricted access to the country\u2019s \n\nAppendix L\n448a\nrefugee camps, the entrances to which had long been \ntightly controlled by Syrian and Lebanese security forces, \nparticularly Ain al-Hilweh on the outskirts of Sidon.\n629.\u2003 Liddawi\u2019s role was soon supplanted by Osama \nHamdan who ran HAMAS\u2019s operations in Beirut during \nthe Second Intifada and acted as the organization\u2019s \npublic spokesman, including appearing on Western news \nchannels like CNN to defend HAMAS\u2019s suicide bombing \ncampaign.\n630.\u2003\nA May 20, 2000, article published by the \nWashington Institute for Near East Policy titled \n\u201cPalestinian Refugees in Lebanon: New Source of Cross-\nBorder Tension?\u201d noted that:\nHamas and PIJ are the most active in the \nrefugee camps, although the Lebanese group \nHizballah and extremist splinter factions such \nas Usbat al-Ansar and al-Jamal Islamiya are \nalso active.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Although in the past Hamas \ncollaboration with Hizballah was limited, \nlately the two have developed closer ties. \nThis relationship extends from the training \nof Hamas operatives in Iran to cooperative \nrecruitment efforts in the refugee camps.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nThe fostering of improved relations between \nHamas, PIJ, and the Iranians (through \nHizballah) has dramatically increased the \ngroups\u2019 penetration of the camps, expanding \ntheir influence and their ability to mobilize \n\nAppendix L\n449a\nthere.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Although Hizballah may want to \nkeep a low profile on Israel\u2019s northern border \nfor some time, these Palestinian groups can \nprovide a willing and increasingly better-\ntrained proxy to continue the fight. Moreover, \nthese groups can lay claim to a legitimacy \nHizballah no longer has: although Israel has \nwithdrawn from Lebanon, the refugees have \nhad no relief for their predicament.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nHizballah is furthermore actively exporting \nits experience to Islamist groups in the West \nBank and Gaza. Reportedly, the group recently \nissued a joint statement with Hamas calling \nfor the \u201cLebanonization\u201d of the territories\u2013an \nimperative not only to continue violent activities, \nbut to switch from terrorist to guerilla tactics. \nIn May 2000, the Hamas monthly Falastin \nal-Muslima made this call explicitly. And the \nHamas website reported this quote from the \nsemi-official Palestinian newspaper al-Hayat al-\nJadida: \u201cO Lebanese joy, spread your delicious \ndisease among us!\u201d\n631.\u2003 Violence in the Palestinian refugee camps was \na constant occurrence. For example, in July 2002, the \nLebanese army deployed tanks and armored vehicles to \nclose the entrances to Ain al-Hilweh camp after gunman \nkilled three Lebanese intelligence agents. Also, in June \n2002, thousands of Palestinians from the Sidon refugee \ncamp protested U.S. support for Israel and burned \nAmerican flags. In 2004, Jihad Mustafa Asaad, a former \n\nAppendix L\n450a\nFatah member was found dead in his home in the same \ncamp. In a separate incident that year a bomb exploded \nin front of the house of a Fatah official in one of the \nPalestinian refugee camps.\n579.632.\u2003\nIn the Palestinian refugee camps in \nsouthern Lebanon, HAMAS and Palestinian Islamic \nJihad competecompeted with secular parties for political \nhegemony and influence. Their main opponent iswas the \nbiggest PLO faction, Fatah.\n580.633.\u2003\nFatah is the largest, oldest and best \norganized of the political movements and has offices and \nrepresentatives in most camps in Lebanon, especially in \nthe camps to the south. The organization was, at least \nduring the 1990s, also better funded and therefore able \nto underwrite social welfare programs, which propelled \nHAMAS\u2019s need to obtain more funding than those of its \npolitical rivals.\n581.634.\u2003 To secure the support of the Palestinian \ncommunity in Lebanon, HAMAS deliberately focused \nmost of their criticism on the PLO\u2019s leaders.\n582.635.\u2003\nHAMAS leaders in Lebanon publicly \naccused the Palestinian Authority of encouraging refugees \nto settle permanently in the country and give up their \n\u201cright of return\u201d to Palestine.\n583.636.\u2003\nIn 1998, HAMAS helped create a \n\u201cPalestinian Ulema League\u201d which was intended as \nan umbrella group for Palestinian Islamic factions in \n\nAppendix L\n451a\nLebanon that wanted to challenge what they saw as the \nPLO\u2019s discredited leadership.\n584.637.\u2003\nThus, during the Camp David peace \nnegotiations of July 2000 that preceded the Second \nIntifada, the Palestinian Ulema League published \nfatwas (religious edicts) forbidding Palestinians to leave \nLebanese territory if a regional settlement was reached \nthat called for Palestinian refugees to emigrate to Europe \nor elsewhere.\n585.638.\u2003 Thus, onOn a smaller scale than it operated \nin the Palestinian Territories, HAMAS pursued the \nsame tactics and goals in Lebanon, using a combination \nof propaganda, social welfare and cash grants and a \ncommitment to violence to energize and gain the loyalty \nof the Palestinians of Lebanon.\n639.\u2003\nAs noted above, at the time, Syria also \npermitted new Hamas recruits to undergo training at \nHezbollah and PFLP-GC camps in the Bekaa Valley, an \narea controlled by the Syrian military.\n640.\u2003\nIranian and Hezbollah instructors in the \ncamps trained hundreds of Hamas operatives in military \ntactics, explosives manufacturing, hostage-taking, \ncommunications, and intelligence gathering.\n586.641.\u2003 For its part, Lebanon (which was largely \ncontrolled by Syria) turned a blind eye to HAMAS\u2019s \nactivities, including itsHAMAS\u2019s substantial financial \nactivity in Lebanon.\n\nAppendix L\n452a\n642.\u2003 In fact, the Syrian regime used Lebanon as a \nmajor conduit for financial support to HAMAS, including \nIranian support for the organization.\n643.\u2003 Lebanese banks, such as Defendant BLOM \nBANK, became important transit points for HAMAS \nfunds that not only funded the recruitment and training of \nHAMAS operatives in Lebanon but also financed terrorist \noperations in the Palestinian Territories.\n644.\u2003 For example, senior HAMAS activist Jamal \nal-Tawil, who was one of the Movement\u2019s most important \noperatives in the Ramallah area, was arrested by Israel \nin 2002 and later told his interrogators that he received \n$12,000 per month from HAMAS\u2019s leadership in Lebanon.\n587.645.\u2003 Other notorious HAMAS operatives in \nthe Palestinian Territories ranging from Abbas al-\nSayed (mastermind of the Park Hotel suicide bombing \nin Netanya) to Jamal Mansur, one of HAMAS\u2019s senior \noperatives in Nablus to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin himself, \nreceived funds transfers from representatives of \nHAMAS\u2019s bureau in Lebanon.\n646.\u2003 On December 9, 2001, Agence France Presse \nreported on a HAMAS demonstration in the Ain el-\nHelweh refugee camp near Sidon, headlined by HAMAS \nleader and spokesman, Osama Hamdan.\n647.\u2003 On January 25, 2002, Agence France Presse \nreported on a HAMAS demonstration in southern Lebanon \nalso headlined by HAMAS leader and spokesman, Osama \nHamdan.\n\nAppendix L\n453a\n648.\u2003 On August 12, 2003, the Los Angeles Times \nreported that \u201c[i]n Lebanon, a Hamas spokesman said the \ngroup had shut its Damascus office and relocated some \nrepresentatives out of the country to save face for Syria. \nBut the spokesman said the closure had not significantly \naffected Hamas operations. The Hamas office in Lebanon, \nwhere Syria exerts strong political influence, continues to \ndo lobbying and media relations work, he said. \u2018There\u2019s \nno big effect on Hamas. We\u2019re still doing our work,\u2019 said \nUsama Hamdan, the group\u2019s Beirut spokesman.\u201d\n649.\u2003 Indeed, the Lebanese Penal Code considers \n\u201cresistance\u201d organizations such as Hezbollah and HAMAS \nlegitimate.\n650.\u2003 In sum, during the relevant period (and still \ntoday) HAMAS operated openly and brazenly in Lebanon. \nTo the extent it downplayed its association with its own \nsocial welfare institutions in Lebanon, it did so for external \nconsumption only\u2014to prevent authorities (particularly \nin major currency centers like the U.S. and Europe) \nfrom cracking down on the influx of funds through the \ninternational financial system. On the ground in Lebanon \nitself, however, it and its social welfare institutions \noperated openly and used their affiliation to gain public \nsupport and recruit and retain adherents to the Movement.\n651.\u2003 As stated above, Hezbollah, for example, openly \nacknowledged that it controlled the purportedly charitable \n\u201cMartyrs Foundation.\u201d\n\nAppendix L\n454a\nII.\t BLOM BANK\u2019S INTERNAL COMPLIANCE AND \nDUE DILIGENCE POLICIES\n652.\u2003 At all relevant times, including during the \nrelevant period, defendant BLOM had actual knowledge \nthat terrorist organizations such as HAMAS require \naccess to funds, including wire transfers and untraceable, \nportable cash, and other banking services in order to \noperate and in order to plan, prepare for and carry out \nterrorist attacks, and that providing these services to \nHAMAS-affiliated entities would enable HAMAS to \nplan, prepare for and carry out terrorist attacks and/or \nenhance HAMAS\u2019s ability to plan, prepare for and carry \nout such attacks. This is because defendant BLOM was \naware of, inter alia, the rules promulgated by the inter-\ngovernmental Financial Action Task Force (\u201cFATF\u201d) and \nby the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task \nForce (\u201cMENAFATF\u201d) (which Lebanon has adopted), \nrequiring banks to know their customers, perform due \ndiligence and not provide banking services to terrorist \norganizations, and that the FATF and MENAFATF rules \nare and were intended to prevent terrorist organizations \nsuch as HAMAS from conducting banking activities, \nincluding wire transfers, and thereby limit their ability \nto operate and to carry out terrorist attacks.\n653.\u2003 In October 2001, FATF issued eight Special \nRecommendations on steps countries should take to \naddress terrorist financing. These included, inter alia, \nstrengthening customer identification measures on \ninternational and domestic wire transfers and ensuring \nthat entities, in particular non-profit organizations \n(\u201cNPOs\u201d), cannot be misused to finance terrorism.\n\nAppendix L\n455a\n654.\u2003 FATF also has identified the receipt of cash \ndeposits by NPOs and international money transfers \nfrom other non-profit organizations to be one typology \npotentially indicating a \u201cnetwork of organisations for \nchanneling terrorist funds.\u201d\n655.\u2003 Similarly, in October 2001, the Basel Committee \non Banking Supervision issued its report on \u201cCustomer \ndue diligence for banks.\u201d12\nCertain key elements should be included by \nbanks in the design of KYC programmes. Such \nessential elements should start from the banks\u2019 \nrisk management and control procedures \nand should include (1) customer acceptance \npolicy, (2) customer identification, (3) on-going \nmonitoring of high risk accounts and (4) risk \nmanagement. Banks should not only establish \nthe identity of their customers, but should \nalso monitor account activity to determine \nthose transactions that do not conform with \nthe normal or expected transactions for that \ncustomer or type of account.\n656.\u2003 The Basel Committee also provided additional \nguidelines for higher risk accounts:\nThere should be intensified monitoring for \nhigher risk accounts. Every bank should set \n12.\u2002 The Basel Committee (which is related to the Bank for \nInternational Settlement, a consortium of central banks) issues the \nindustry-standard and highly influential \u201cBasel Accords\u201d policy \nrecommendations.\n\nAppendix L\n456a\nkey indicators for such accounts, taking note \nof the background of the customer, such as the \ncountry of origin and source of funds, the type \nof transactions involved, and other risk factors. \nFor higher risk accounts:\n\u2022\t Banks should ensure that they have \nadequate management information \nsystems to provide managers and \ncompliance officers with timely \ninformation needed to identify, \nanalyse and effectively monitor \nhigher risk customer accounts. \nThe types of reports that may be \nneeded include reports of missing \naccount opening documentation, \ntransactions made through a \ncustomer account that are unusual, \nand aggregations of a customer\u2019s \ntotal relationship with the bank.\n\u2022\t Senior management in charge of \nprivate banking business should \nknow the personal circumstances \nof the bank\u2019s high risk customers \nand be alert to sources of third \nparty information. Significant \ntransactions by these customers \nshould be approved by a senior \nmanager. (Emphasis added.)\n\nAppendix L\n457a\n657.\u2003 BLOM\u2019s AML/CFT policies have likewise \nincluded enhanced due diligence for charities and NPOs, \nincluding continuous monitoring.\n658.\u2003 For instance, in recent years, BLOM has \nacknowledged the need \u201cto avoid the misuse of NPOs in \nfinancial crimes including in terrorism financing\u201d and \nhas established \u201cdetailed policies and procedures for \nconducting business with NPOs.\u201d These include ensuring \nthe NPO is not \u201cused as a vehicle for terrorism financing\u201d \nor that the relationship would not \u201cbreach international \nsanctions,\u201d and \u201ccontinuous monitoring.\u201d\n659.\u2003 Likewise, its current policies, still echoing \nFATF\u2019s 2001 recommendations, acknowledge that that \nNPOs and NGOs \u201chave been of a concern since they have \nbeen misused by terrorists and criminals as vehicles for \nraising and laundering funds destined for terrorism. In \norder to avoid the abuse of NPOs and NGOs in F[inancial] \nC[rimes] specifically in terrorism financing, BLOM has set \ndetailed policies and procedures for conducting business \nwith NPOs and NGOs. In this context, NPOs and NGOs \nare considered high risk customers.\u201d\n660.\u2003 Thus, NPOs are subject to enhanced due \ndiligence; but presumably even more so where they are \nopenly affiliated with terrorist groups.\n661.\u2003 Reviewing a suspicious account in that context \nwould involve a transactional review, including a review \nof prior transactions. During such review, for instance, \nBLOM would have noticed that Sanabil was receiving \n\nAppendix L\n458a\nvast sums from an entity (HLF) recently designated as \nan SDGT by the United States for supporting HAMAS \nterrorism; it also would have been particularly sensitive to \ntransactions from groups like the Al-Aqsa Foundation.13\n662.\u2003 Sanabil\u2019s and Subul al-Khair\u2019s regular large \ncash withdrawals (whether performed in single large \nwithdrawals or many smaller ones) also would have gained \nBLOM\u2019s attention.\n663.\u2003 Between 1998 and 2001, BLOM deposited \nover $2 million USD from HLF to Sanabil\u2019s account(s), \nincluding $1 million in 2000, a vast amount for a nominal \ncharity operating near a small city like Sidon. Lebanon\u2019s \nper capita Gross National Income was $4,600 in 2000 \n(in the United States in 2000, it was nearly $36,000); \nbut the equivalent figures were lower still for Sidon and \nmuch lower in the Palestinian refugee camps, making \nthe amounts received by Sanabil remarkable (and very \nnoticeable) for the branch.\n664.\u2003 MENAFATF has also confirmed that \u201c[c]ash \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. remains the raw material of most criminal activity. In \nmany cases, even when the proceeds of a crime are initially \ngenerated in electronic form .\u00a0.\u00a0. criminals choose to \nwithdraw the funds from a bank account in cash, transport \n13.\u2002 Lebanese charities on average receive less than 25% of \ntheir funding from international donors. Local private funding, \ngovernment funding, personal donations, membership fees and \nservice fees typically make up the bulk of their revenues, but this \nwas not the case with respect to the HAMAS fundraising accounts \ndetailed herein.\n\nAppendix L\n459a\nit to another country, and pay it into another account in \norder to break an audit trail.\u201d\n665.\u2003 MENAFATF has also acknowledged that \ntransporting cash is associated with, inter alia, \u201cthe \nfinancing of terrorism.\u201d\n666.\u2003 MENAFATF has further confirmed that \u201c[t]he \nprincipal benefit is often said to be that cash is anonymous \nand leaves no audit trail. The anonymity of cash is often \nquoted as one of the main reasons for its use in the criminal \neconomy and there is no doubt that, up to a certain level, \nthis is the case. Demonstrating the provenance of small \namounts of cash can be problematical for law enforcement \nofficials.\u201d\n667.\u2003 Indeed, BLOM itself did not know the ultimate \npurposes or uses of the large cash withdrawals Sanabil \nand Subul al-Khair made from their BLOM accounts.\n668.\u2003 During the relevant period, BLOM BANK \npurported to have an Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting \nFinancing of Terrorism (\u201cAML/CFT\u201d) Compliance Officer \nin place together with procedures to comply with Know-\nYour-Customer (\u201cKYC\u201d) policies and internal reporting \nprocedures for identifying suspicious transactions. \nIt also purportedly maintained internal controls to \nforestall and/or prevent money laundering (including via \ncompliance officers, its compliance unit, and Internal \nAudit functions). One of the bank\u2019s stated policy goals \nwas to make certain that suspicious transactions were \nreported to the Compliance Officer at Head Office tasked \n\nAppendix L\n460a\nwith determining whether a report was to be made to the \nLebanese authorities.\n669.\u2003 During the relevant period, BLOM BANK\u2019s \npurported KYC policies required the bank to learn the \ntrue identity of their clients and that of the beneficial \nowners of accounts at the bank, when operations were \nbeing carried out through proxies or individuals acting \non behalf of other individuals, institutions, or companies.\n670.\u2003 BLOM BANK\u2019s purported KYC policies were \nalso intended to identify signals revealing the existence of \nmoney laundering operations and establish due diligence \nprinciples to help the bank detect suspicious operations.\n671.\u2003\nBLOM BANK also committed to having \nprocedures in place to monitor customers\u2019 transactions \nand the Compliance Unit at the Head Office was supposed \nto generate daily and quarterly reports as part of this \ntransaction monitoring.\n672.\u2003 Similarly, bank employees were instructed to \nflag any transaction which did not fit within a customer\u2019s \ntransaction profile and those anomalies were to be \nreviewed by the AML Compliance Officer at the branch \nand the branch manager.\n673.\u2003 BLOM BANK thus had actual knowledge that \nterrorist organizations such as HAMAS require wire \ntransfers and other banking services in order to plan, \nprepare for, and carry out terrorist attacks, and the \nBank understood that providing such banking services \nto HAMAS would enhance the terrorist organization\u2019s \n\nAppendix L\n461a\nability to recruit and sustain its operatives and perpetrate \nterrorist attacks.\n674.\u2003 In fact, during the relevant period (and still \ntoday), as noted above, both Hezbollah and HAMAS \noperate openly and \u201clegally\u201d in Lebanon\u2014with Hezbollah \nas the dominant political and military force in the country. \nThus, the bank\u2019s compliance infrastructure would \ncertainly have identified the risk posed by its HAMAS \nfundraising customers and understood the international \nrules prohibiting providing banking services to terrorist \norganizations, perhaps even more acutely than a bank \noperating a far less high-risk jurisdiction.\n675.\u2003 During the relevant period, it was common \nknowledge in Lebanon that FTOs operate through \npurported \u201ccharitable\u201d institutions. For instance, Hezbollah \nhas openly, publicly, and repeatedly acknowledged and \npublicized that the \u201ccharitable\u201d institution, the Martyrs \nFoundation, belongs to and is a part of Hezbollah, \nincluding on its official websites, in official press releases \nissued by Hezbollah, on Hezbollah\u2019s official television \nstation, Al-Manar, on Hezbollah\u2019s official radio station, \nAl-Nour, and in numerous press conferences and news \nmedia interviews conducted by senior Hezbollah officials.\n676.\u2003 The Martyrs Foundation\u2019s affiliation with \nHezbollah was not only widely known in Lebanon. For \nexample, as early as October 1991, The Independent \nnewspaper (published in London) reported that the \nMartyrs Foundation supplies stipends to the families of \nHezbollah terrorists.\n\nAppendix L\n462a\n677.\u2003 A November 7, 1993, article in The New York \nTimes reported:\nOn the grass-roots level, Hamas leaders hope to \nmaintain their movement\u2019s influence, which has been built \nthrough a growing network of social service organizations \naided by financing from Saudi Arabia, other gulf Arab \nstates and Iran. Hamas has used Islamic welfare groups \nto win support, especially in the impoverished Gaza Strip, \nwhere it has filled gaps left by inadequate Government \nservices.\n678.\u2003 Similarly, as noted above, on March 15, 1996, \na feature article in The New York Times detailed the \nfinancing of HAMAS by so-called charitable organizations: \n\u201cMost of Hamas\u2019s estimated $70 million annual budget \ngoes to support a network of hundreds of mosques, schools, \norphanages, clinics and hospitals that permeates virtually \nevery village, town and refugee camp on the West Bank \nand Gaza Strip. But these social services provide both a \ncover and a recruiting ground for young terrorists. One \nof the important uses of charitable donations to Hamas \nis to provide lifetime annuities to the families of suicide \nbombers.\u201d\n679.\u2003 A March 7, 1996, article in the French daily \nnewspaper Nouvel Obs titled \u201cWho can stop the killers \nof Hamas?\u201d reported that HAMAS is not only a terrorist \norganization, but also and mostly a nebula of associations, \nschools, orphanages, and clinics that involve close to one \nmillion dollars per year.\n\nAppendix L\n463a\n680.\u2003 On December 1, 1996, the Associated Press \nran a story titled, \u201cFrom Gaza Alleys to Turkish Slums, \nHelping Hand Key to Success.\u201d The article reported:\nThe Islamic Society is part of a sprawling \nnetwork of charities and social institutions \nwith ties to the Islamic Resistance Movement, \nbetter known as Hamas, whose gunmen and \nsuicide bombers have staged repeated attacks \ninside Israel.\nBut before any Hamas activist picked up a \ngun, its affiliated social service groups were \nbuilding popular support, mixing charity, \nIslamic consciousness and politics.\n681.\u2003 On September 17, 1997, the UK-based Mideast \nMirror published an article titled \u201cHow to break the \ndeadlock: Armed resistance, plus Arab pressure on U.S.\u201d\n682.\u2003 The article quotes the Arabic press regarding \nGulf State sources of funding for HAMAS:\nAccording to al-Hayat\u2019s sources, only some \n$ 10 million dollars is raised annually by \nPalestinian Islamist charities in the Gulf, most \nof which is paid directly to visiting fund-raising \ndelegations or the charities\u2019 bank accounts in \nJordan, or via Palestinian support groups based \nin the U.S. or Britain.\nGulf-based charities also say they make a point \nof ensuring that recipients are recognized by \n\nAppendix L\n464a\nthe Jordanian religious affairs ministry or \nthe PA\u2019s Jerusalem-based religious affairs \ndepartment. They include the Zakat (alms) \nCommittees in Hebron, Jerusalem, Tulkarem, \nKalkilya and Gaza, which fund schools, Koran \nteaching classes and orphanages, provide cash \nor food aid to the families of martyrs, and \nrun self-help schemes for needy families. Gulf \nfunding also sustains the Islamic Charitable \nSociety in Hebron, Jerusalem\u2019s Makassed \nHospital, and the Wafa Society in Gaza which \nlooks after the elderly.\nGulf donors also insist that they have always dealt \nopenly with such organizations, which Israel \naccuses of constituting the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d \nof Hamas. \u201cWe used to work with these \norganizations in broad daylight in the days of \ndirect Israeli occupation, and continued dealing \nwith them under the PA, though regrettably \nthe pressures increased with the advent of the \nPA,\u201d al-Hayat quotes one aid worker as saying.\nAs for higher educational institutions, the main \nrecipient of Gulf aid is Gaza Islamic University, \nwhich has long been described as a \u201cHamas \nstronghold.\u201d\n683.\u2003 Thus, although Hezbollah, HAMAS and other \nFTOs used charitable fronts in Western countries to avoid \ndetection from authorities, their social networks operated \nopenly in the Middle East, including in Lebanon.\n\nAppendix L\n465a\n684.\u2003 As the FBI\u2019s Watson Memo affirmed, the \ncivilian population that received the services provided by \nHAMAS\u2019s social welfare network understood that those \n\u201csocial services are being provided by HAMAS.\u201d That is \nthe whole point.\n685.\u2003 BLOM had actual knowledge that the accounts \nat the bank identified herein were raising funds for the \nbenefit HAMAS and that HAMAS would use the funds \n(at least in part) to further its operations, including its \nviolent campaign of terror against Israel.\nII.III.\u2003 BLOM BANK\u2019S HAMAS CUSTOMERS\nA.\t Sanabil Association for Relief and \nDevelopment\u2014HAMAS\u2019s Da\u2019wa Headquarters \nin Lebanon\n588.686.\u2003 The Sanabil Association for Relief and \nDevelopment (\u201cSanabil\u201d), based in Sidon, Lebanon, was \nHAMAS\u2019s da\u2019wa headquarters in Lebanon until late \n2003., functioning like Hamas\u2019s zakat committees in \nthe Palestinian Territories.

HAMAS recruits \npermanent members from the religious and \nthe poor by extending charity to them from \norganizations such as Sanabil.\nAt the request of a HAMAS political leader, \nSanabil began opening offices in all of the \nPalestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in August \nof 2001 in order to increase the foundation\u2019s role \ninside the camps. After starting by providing \nbasic necessities the charity eventually began \nasking poor families within the camps to fill \nout application forms, particularly those who \nhad worked with the Islamic Movement (Al-\nHaraka al-Islamiyya) and HAMAS. As a result \nof these efforts, Sanabil has increased its scope \nof influence within the camps.15\n691.\u2003\nUnsurprisinglyHAMAS\u2019s purpose in \nestablishing its da\u2019wa offices in Lebanon through Sanabil \n15.\u2002 \u201cU.S. Designates Five Charities Funding Hamas and Six \nSenior Hamas Leaders as Terrorist Entities,\u201d U.S. Department \nof the Treasury Press Release, August 22, 2003.\n\nAppendix L\n468a\nwas in large part to improve its standing in the Palestinian \nrefugee camps and reward its adherents while recruiting \nand paying new operatives, some of whom would go on \nto train in the Bekaa Valley. However, because Sanabil \ntook in large donations from HAMAS fundraisers in the \nU.S., Britain, Germany, and France and withdrew large \nsums from its BLOM Bank account in cash, it is likely \nthat HAMAS diverted a substantial amount of money for \nother purposes and in any event, once these funds were \nwithdrawn from BLOM Bank they became untraceable.\n692.\u2003 Given that the organization was established \nby HAMAS and acted as a HAMAS alter-ego in \nLebanon, Sanabil\u2019s board members were, unsurprisingly, \npredominantly well-known HAMAS leaders in Lebanon. \nat the time.\n591.693.\u2003 For example, HAMAS\u2019s current senior \nleader in Lebanon, Ahmed Muhammad Abd al-Hadi, \nserved on Sanabil\u2019s board of trustees during the relevant \nperiod (over the years he was also HAMAS\u2019s deputy \nrepresentative and spokesman in Lebanon, serving openly \nas a Hamas operative during the relevant period).\n592.694.\u2003 Abdallah Atawat served as Sanabil\u2019s Deputy \nChairman of the Board of Trustees during the relevant \nperiod and as a board member of the Welfare Association \nfor Palestinian and Lebanese Families (subsequently \ndesignated by the U.S. Treasury Department as an \nSDGT).

KindHearts was founded in \nJanuary 2002 and incorporated as a non-profit in Toledo, \nOhio.

For example, \nthe English language homepage for www.101days.org in \nJuly 2001:\n743.\u2003 Born in 1926 in Egypt, Sheikh al-Qaradawi \nwas an adherent of the teachings of Hassan al-Banna, the \nfounder of the Muslim Brotherhood and was imprisoned \nfor lengthy periods in Egyptian jails.\n\nAppendix L\n486a\n744.\u2003 In 1961, he emigrated from Egypt to Qatar \n(where he lives to this day). In 1977, al-Qaradawi established \na faculty for Shari\u2019a Studies at Qatar University, and also \nestablished an institute for the research in the Sunna. \nThese institutions gave him added authority in connection \nwith the legal rulings that he gave.\n745.\u2003 Sheikh al-Qaradawi was (and is) one of the \nmost recognizable figures in the Arab and Muslim world. \nDuring the years before, during and after the Second \nIntifada, he was best known for his weekly television \nprogram on the Al Jazeera satellite channel called \u201cSharia \nand Life\u201d (\u201cal-Shar\u012b\u02bfa wa al-\u1e24ay\u0101h\u201d), on which he analyzed \nnumerous topics through the lens of Islamic thought.\n\nAppendix L\n487a\n746.\u2003 He is (and during the relevant period was) one \nof Muslim world\u2019s most prominent public supporters of \nHAMAS and its campaign of violence against Israel.\n747.\u2003\nThe Al Jazeera hosted program reached \napproximately 60 million viewers during its height before \nits end in 2013.\n748.\u2003 Sheikh al-Qaradawi was also one of the first \nIslamic scholars to launch his own website and was also \na co-founder of the popular Muslim Brotherhood website \nIslamOnline.net, which features a larger number of his \nfatwas. He has written over 120 books and has gained even \ngreater eminence throughout the Muslim world by serving \nas the chairman of numerous Islamic organizations and \noperating on a variety of media platforms. For example, for \nmany years he headed the Dublin-based European Council \nfor Fatwa and Research, an influential European Muslim \ninstitution that issues fatwas for Europe\u2019s practicing \nMuslims.\n749.\u2003 Al-Qaradawi has long stated that \u201c[t]he martyr \noperations [sic] is the greatest of all sorts of Jihad in the \nCause of Allah.\u201d\n750.\u2003 Even before the Second Intifada erupted in \n2000, Sheikh al-Qaradawi was a leading voice in Arab \nand Islamic politics endorsing violence against Israel, \npublicly asserting for example, that: \u201cThere should be no \ndialogue with these people [Israelis] except with swords.\u201d \nSee Leading Muslim Cleric Under Fire for Meeting \nIsraeli Chief Rabbi,\u201d AP Worldstream, January 7, 1998, \n\nAppendix L\n488a\nquoting a January 6, 1998, article by al-Qaradawi in the \nArab newspaper Al-Shaab.\n632.751.Sheikh al-Qaradawi issued a Muslim religious \nedict (fatwa) that gave HAMAS and other terrorist \ngroups religious approval authorizing suicide bombing \nattacks (including by women) against Israel.\n752.\u2003 During 2001, on his Shariah and Life broadcast \non Al Jazeera, Sheikh al-Qaradawi was asked what could \nbe done to show the Palestinian people that there were \npeople standing by them. He replied:\nNo doubt there are steps that need to be taken \nat the official and popular level .\u00a0.\u00a0. There is \nanother thing: Financial Jihad. Our brethren \nare struggling for money. They are sacrificing \nthemselves. They are giving martyrs every \nday. Thank God this means that the Umma is \ngiving martyrs. Women cry for joy at the death \nof the martyrs .\u00a0.\u00a0. We should give aid to our \nbrethren to reinforce their steadfastness, to try \nand overcome the blockade enforced on them.\n753.\u2003 Later in the interview, Sheikh al-Qaradawi \nanswered further questions about the duties of Muslims \nregarding the conflict with Israel, and he said:\nWe should resist and resist with what we \nhave. We do not have nuclear weapons .\u00a0.\u00a0. I \nam surprised at any Muslim who calls these \nacts \u201csuicide acts.\u201d These are martyrdom, \n\nAppendix L\n489a\ncommando and heroic acts. We should hail those \nwho carry out these acts and bless them and \ncall on God to take them to live in Paradise. \nThey are there, God willing, because of their \nintentions, works, efforts and Jihad.\n754.\u2003 In an interview the Egyptian newspaper, \nAl-Ahram Al-Arabi on February 3, 2001, al-Qaradawi \nexplained his ruling:\nHe who commits suicide kills himself for his \nown benefit, while he who commits martyrdom \nsacrifices himself for the sake of his religion and \nhis nation. While someone who commits suicide \nhas lost hope with himself and with the spirit of \nAllah, the Mujahid is full of hope with regard \nto Allah\u2019s spirit and mercy. He fights his enemy \nand the enemy of Allah with this new weapon, \nwhich destiny has put in the hands of the weak, \nso that they would fight against the evil of the \nstrong and arrogant. The Mujahid becomes a \n\u2018human bomb\u2019 that blows up at a specific place \nand time, in the midst of the enemies of Allah \nand the homeland, leaving them helpless in the \nface of the brave Shahid who .\u00a0.\u00a0. sold his soul \nto Allah, and sought the Shahada [Martyrdom] \nfor the sake of Allah.\n755.\u2003 In an April 25, 2001, interview with a Qatari \nnewspaper, Al-Raya, al-Qaradawi further explained \nthat suicide bombings against targets in Israel \u201care the \nsupreme form of Jihad for the sake of Allah, and a type \n\nAppendix L\n490a\nof terrorism that is allowed by the Shari\u2019a.\u201d He cited \na Koranic verse stating that one must be prepared to \n\u201cspread fear among one\u2019s enemies and the enemies of \nAllah,\u201d and added that \u201cthe term \u2018suicide operations\u2019 is an \nincorrect and misleading term, because these are heroic \noperations of martyrdom, and have nothing to do with \nsuicide. The mentality of those who carry them out has \nnothing to do with the mentality of someone who commits \nsuicide.\u201d19\n756.\u2003\nOn June 2, 2001, Agence France Presse \nreported that Sheikh al-Qaradawi criticized Sheikh \nTantawi for disapproving of suicide bombing, quoting him \nas saying on May 12, 2001: \u201cThese martyr operations led \nby the Palestinian fighters against Israel spring from \nresistance and all Muslims who kill to defend their land, \nhonour and religion are martyrs.\u201d\n757.\u2003 In an op-ed in the Guardian on August 28, 2001, \nFaisal Bodi wrote: \u201cThe world\u2019s most quoted independent \nIslamic jurist, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, calls the \n[suicide] bombs \u2018commendable\u2019 and \u2018among the greatest \nform of holy struggle against oppression.\u2019\u201d\n758.\u2003 On September 16, 2001, al-Qaradawi appeared \non Al-Jazeera Television in Qatar to discuss the September \n11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. \n19.\u2002 Also quoted in Michael Slackman, \u201cIslamic Debate \nSurrounds Mideast Suicide Bombers,\u201d The Los Angeles Times, \nMay 27, 2001.

This kind of \nterror is legitimate. The Palestinian factions \ndefending their land, such as Fatah, Hamas, or \nIslamic Jihad, are not terrorists. [It is] a Jihad \nfor the sake of Allah .\u00a0.\u00a0.\nEven if the US is guilty, in that it supports \nthis Israeli terror, I say that this does not \nmean that we may attack civilians in the US, \nbecause the civilians are not guilty. We should \nfight the American military if we can, and if \nwe cannot, we should fight the US economically \nand politically.\n759.\u2003 The Associate Press reported on February \n26, 2002, that \u201cYoussef al-Qaradawi, a highly respected \nEgyptian clergyman, said suicide bombings\u2014themselves \na matter of debate among Muslims\u2014are the best form of \njihad and that \u2018what applies to men also applies to women.\u2019\u201d\n760.\u2003 In March 2002, in a Hamas journal published \nin Britain called Filasteen al-Muslama, al-Qaradawi \nstated that the participation of women in suicide terrorist \nattacks is not only permitted but even desirable, and that \nit is permitted for a woman to deviate from the rules \nthat obligate her in daily life, from the point of view of \n\nAppendix L\n492a\npreserving her modesty, to carry out the suicide attack \n(for example, in his ruling, al-Qaradawi permits women to \ntravel for the purpose of carrying out the suicide attacks \nwithout being escorted by a male relative, and is even \nlenient in regard to covering her head and wearing a veil).\n761.\u2003 In a May 4, 2002, article published in Akhbar \nal-Khaleej (UAE), al-Qaradawi\u2019s lecture (given in the \nUAE) outlined his view that that collecting money for the \nmujahideen (jihad fighters, or \u201cMuslim holy warriors\u201d) \nwas not a donation or a gift, but \u201ca duty necessitated by \nthe sacrifices they made for the Muslim nation.\u201d\n762.\u2003 On June 13, 2003, al-Qaradawi appeared on \nQatar Television to discuss, among other things, the Bush \nAdministration\u2019s efforts to restart negotiations between \nthe Palestinian Authority and Israel. Al-Qaradawi stated:\nThe Intifada expresses an assertive and \nproud people, a heroic people, a people that \nis unperturbed by death. A people that wants \nto live free, in honor, or die martyred. It is \ninconceivable that this people will die, despite \nthe attempts of the Zionist entity state and of \nits strategic ally, the U.S. As much as they try \nto kill the Intifada and crush the resistance, \nthey will not succeed.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nI say to [PA Prime Minister] Mahmoud Abbas, \nto [PA Security Minister] Muhammad Dahlan, \nand to the ministers who support them, that \nthe day Hamas and [Islamic] Jihad, Al-Aqsa \n\nAppendix L\n493a\nMartyrs Brigades, and the Mujahideen cease \nto exist, nothing will remain to negotiate about \nor to cling to. You will stand in your nakedness. \nNo one will support you. What pushed the \nZionists and the Americans to present the road \nmap is the [defeat] they suffered as a result of \nthe martyrdom operations that shook their \nfoundations, undermined their existence, and \nsowed fear in their hearts.\n633.763.\u2003 In a July 7, 2004, interview for BBC\u2019s \n\u201cNewsnight,\u201d al-Qaradawi, referring to the suicide \nattacks, said: \u201cI consider this type of martyrdom operation \nas an evidence of God\u2019s justice.\u201d\n764.\u2003 Other prominent trustees of the Union of Good \nincluded three prominent Lebanese figures: Sheikh Dr. \nFeisal Mawlawi, Sheikh Dr. Marwan Qabbani and Ahmad \nal-Zayn.\n765.\u2003\nSheikh Mawlawi was a co-founder of the \nEuropean Council for Fatwa and Research with Sheikh \nal-Qaradawi and served as a member of the Guidance \nOffice of the World Muslim Brotherhood.\n766.\u2003 In 1997 he participated in a convention marking \nthe tenth anniversary of the founding of Hamas and \nhe also published a fatwa on the www.islam-online.net \nwebsite permitting the perpetration of suicide bombing \nattacks, asserting that: \u201cistishhad is not suicide and \nshould not be seen as unfit and endangering the life of the \nperpetrator .\u00a0.\u00a0. regarding the Palestinians .\u00a0.\u00a0. I believe \n\nAppendix L\n494a\nthat those actions are a duty performed in self-defense \nand [represent] active opposition to violence and injustice.\u201d\n767.\u2003 Ahmad al-Zayn was a judge in the Shar\u2019ia \n(Muslim religious) court in Sidon, Lebanon.\n768.\u2003 The board of trustees of the Union of Good also \nincluded Abd Al-Majid Al-Zindani, one of the spiritual \nleaders of Al-Qaeda and the alleged coordinator of the \nOctober 2000 suicide attack in Aden harbor on the USS \nCole.\n634.769.\u2003 The 101-day fundraising drive was so \nsuccessful that the Union of Good was converted into a \npermanent institution. It quickly became the preeminent \nMuslim Brotherhood fundraising mechanism in the world, \nraising (at least) tens of millions of dollars for HAMAS.\n635.770.\u2003 On February 25, 2002, the Union of Good \nwas designated by Israel in an order of the Minister \nof Defense of the State of Israel, based on its being \n\u201cpart of the Hamas organization or supporting it and \nstrengthening its infrastructure.\u201d\n636.771.\u2003 The Union of Good was designated by the \nU.S. Treasury Department as an SDGT on November 12, \n2008. According to the Treasury Department:\nUnion of Good acts as a broker for HAMAS by \nfacilitating financial transfers between a web \nof charitable organizations\u2014including several \norganizations previously designated under E.O. \n\nAppendix L\n495a\n13224 for providing support to HAMAS\u2014and \nHAMAS-controlled organizations in the West \nBank and Gaza. The primary purpose of this \nactivity is to strengthen HAMAS\u2019 political \nand military position in the West Bank and \nGaza, including by: (i) diverting charitable \ndonations to support HAMAS members and \nthe families of terrorist operatives; and (ii) \ndispensing social welfare and other charitable \nservices on behalf of HAMAS.\nFunds raised by the Union of Good affiliates \nhave been transferred to HAMAS-managed \norganizations in the West Bank and Gaza. In \naddition to providing cover for HAMAS financial \ntransfers, some of the funds transferred by the \nUnion of Good have compensated HAMAS \nterrorists by providing payments to the \nfamilies of suicide bombers. One of them, the \nAl-Salah Society, previously identified as a key \nsupport node for HAMAS, was designated in \nAugust 2007 under E.O. 13224. The Society \nemployed a number of members of the HAMAS \nmilitary wing and supported HAMAS-affiliated \ncombatants during the first Intifada.\n637.\u2003 Significantly, Al-Qaradawi is neither an obscure \nor shadowy figure. On the contrary, he had his own weekly \nlong-running television program on Al-Jazeera and has \nvery publicly issued an Islamic religious edict (fatwa) \nauthorizing suicide bombing attacks against Israel.\n\nAppendix L\n496a\n638.772.\u2003 In factAs noted above, on April 14, 2002, \nal-Qaradawi appeared on Al-Jazeera extolling \u201cjihad and \nmartyrdom\u201d against Israelis and denouncing the U.S. \ndesignation of HAMAS and other terrorist organizations.\n639.773.\u2003 HAMAS often relies on Alal-Qaradawi\u2019s \nlegal rulings in matters of current import and often turns \nto him to obtain legal rulings, which are published from \ntime to time in HAMAS\u2019s official newspapers (such as \nFilastin al-Muslima).\n640.774.\u2003 HAMAS leaders have also served openly \nin the Union of Good\u2019s executive leadership. For example, \nthe Secretary General of the Union of Good, Essam \nSalih Mustafa Yussuf, also acted as the Vice-Chairman \nof Interpal while serving on the HAMAS executive \ncommittee under then-HAMAS leader Khalid Mishal.\n775.\u2003 The Union of GoodAs noted above, when it first \nbegan its fundraising drive in 2001, the Union of Good \ncollected funds through HAMAS\u2019s existing network of \nfundraising organizations such the Holy Land Foundation \nand Interpal.\n776.\u2003\nIn Lebanon, the Union of Good collected \ndonations through the Zakat Fund,20 which maintained \naccount no. 349647341149 at BLOM BANK\u2019s Verdun \nBranch (at least as of February 5, 2001, and likely earlier).\n20.\u2002 Unlike Sanabil and Subul Al-Khair, the Zakat Fund was \nnot itself an alter-ego and creation of HAMAS.

According to \nthe website:\nIn the opening ceremony, the Mufti of the \nRepublic [of Lebanon], Sheikh Dr. Muhammad \nRashid Qabbani called on all those who pay \ntheir money in Lebanon and the Arab and \nIslamic world to devote the God\u2019s share of their \nmoney in zakat to send it to Palestine and [he] \nwarned that the Palestinian bloody scene will \nbe repeated in Arab and Islamic capitals if \nthey do nothing in the face of the tyrant, the \nAmerican Jew.\n\nAppendix L\n501a\n784.\u2003 According to the Zakat Fund website, Sheikh \nQabbani spoke again at the event, this time explaining:\nThe Union of Good for the sake of Palestine, \ngentlemen, is a coalition for the sake of all Arabs \nand Muslims, and the coalition is unity, and if \nwe do not unite around Palestine for the sake of \nall Arab and Muslim countries, then what can \nwe unite about? He added: If we do not spend \nour money today for the sake of Palestine, for \nwhat can we spend our money? Our brothers in \nPalestine are killed by the Jews every day, the \nJews are capturing their sons every day, and \nthe Jews are destroying their homes every day. \nArabs and Muslims do very little for the sake of \ntheir brothers, sons, and families in Palestine, \nin front of the arsenals and treasuries of \nJews and the United States of America that \nthey open to Israel every day. The Arabs and \nMuslims said that if they do nothing in the face \nof the American Jewish tyrant, the Palestinian \nbloody scene will be repeated in their capitals \ntomorrow, every day. He [Sheikh Qabbani] \nstressed that giving money today for the sake \nof Palestine, gentlemen, is jihad with money, \njust as giving oneself for Palestine is jihad with \noneself, and God Almighty loves us jihad with \nmoney and soul as well.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nAnd he said: Gentlemen, peoples do not sell \ntheir homelands, nor give up an inch of their \nland, no matter how strong their enemy is, and \n\nAppendix L\n502a\nthe people of Palestine today, with their men, \nwomen and children, are the vanguard of the \nmujahideen [holy warriors] for the liberation \nof Palestine, and it is the model of jihad for all \nArabs and Muslims, and let the United States of \nAmerica and Israel know that the expressions \nof terrorism and the terrorists they use with \ntheir tongues will not frighten us and will not \nintimidate us, and our will and determination to \nliberate all of Palestine is greater and stronger \nthan all their strength, capabilities and weapons \nof destruction, only they can kill more, and God \nis greater, stronger and more capable.\n785.\u2003 On January 6, 2003, one of HAMAS\u2019s websites \nreported that \u201cthe Palestinian Monetary Authority \nconfiscated a number of checks donated by the UG / \nLebanese branch on the ground that they were intended \nfor the support of terrorism.\u201d\n786.\u2003 According to the Zakat Fund website (in 2003) \nits Union of Good campaign had raised $1,183,845.31, much \nof it in cash, and \u201csent into Palestine in stages.\u201d\n787.\u2003 The Zakat Fund website made its association \nwith HAMAS more explicit when it posted a brochure \nhighlighting its fundraising efforts for the Palestinians. \nThe last page of the brochure featured the iconic image \nof HAMAS spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.\n788.\u2003 The caption reads: With every sunrise in \nPalestine .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . [followed by the phrases]: Sheiks are \n\nAppendix L\n503a\nhumiliated * babies are orphaned * young men are \narrested * heroes are martyred.\n789.\u2003\nAs noted above, when the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment designated all branches of the Al-Aqsa \nFoundation as an SDGT pursuant to Executive Order \n13224 on May 29, 2003, it specifically noted that the \nFoundation\u2019s offices were \u201cincluded in lists of organizations \nthat contributed to the Hamas-affiliated Charity Coalition \n[Union of Good] in 2001 and 2002.\u201d\n790.\u2003 As the Israel Security Agency summarized in \n2009:\n[HAMAS\u2019s] \u201cDa\u2019wa\u201d\u2018 system was established \non the basis of charity monies that are donated \nby Muslims from around the world, who regard \ncharity an Islamic duty. In effect, Hamas uses \nthe \u201cDa\u2019wa\u201d system to advance its goals, which \ninclude: encouraging terrorism; executing the \nideology of \u201cJihad\u201d and the struggle against \nIsrael; and recruiting new members to its \n\nAppendix L\n504a\nranks and to its military wing. Encouraging \nterrorism is done, among other methods, \nthrough the financial support that is provided \nto the families of the terrorists (dead, injured, \nand prisoners). The families receive grants and \nmonthly allowances alongside other benefits.\nThe mobilization of most of the funding sources \nof Hamas\u2019s \u201cDa\u2019wa\u201d system is conducted \nabroad, where dozens of assigned charitable \nfunds constitute part of the movement\u2019s \nfundraising network. These charitable funds \nare incorporated within the \u201cUnion of Good.\u201d \nOver the past few years, enforcement measures \nhad been taken against the \u201cUnion of Good,\u201d \nmainly by the U.S and European countries.\n641.791.\u2003 At some point either during or after the \nend of the Second Intifada, the Union of Good opened \na second account (no. 349647) under the auspices of the \nZakat Fund at Defendant BLOM BANK\u2019s branches \nlocated on the prestigious Verdun Streetbranch in Beirut \nand BLOM BANK kept the account open at least through \nFebruary 2009, three months after the Union of Good was \ndesignated by the United States as an SDGT.\n\nAppendix L\n505a\nCLAIM FOR RELIEF\nCIVIL LIABILITY UNDER 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d) \nFOR AIDING AND ABETTING HAMAS, \nA DEISGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST \nORGANIZATION\n642.792.\u2003\nPlaintiffs repeat and re-allege every \nallegation of the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth \nherein.\n643.793.\u2003\nPlaintiffs were all injured by acts of \ninternational terrorism as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02331 \nthat were committed, planned and authorized by HAMAS, \na designated FTO at the time each act of terrorism \ndescribed occurred.\n644.794.\u2003\nBLOM BANK provided substantial \nassistance to HAMAS by transferring significant sums \nof money to HAMAS and its operatives and maintaining \nbank accounts for its key institutions in Lebanon.\n645.795.\u2003 BLOM BANK was fully aware of HAMAS\u2019s \nconduct, including its campaign of suicide bombings and \nother terrorist acts.\n645.796.\u2003 BLOM BANK understood the value and \nimportance to HAMAS of its own role in facilitating large \ntransfers of funds, including the cross-border transfer of \nU.S. dollars, from donors and co-conspirators around the \nworld to Lebanon and making those funds easily available \nto HAMAS.\n\nAppendix L\n506a\n646.797.\u2003\nPlaintiffs allege that BLOM BANK \nknowingly aided and abetted HAMAS within the meaning \nof 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02333(d) and within the legal framework \nof Halberstam v.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v.

Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v.

The \nmatter is closed, the claim is \u201cextinguishe[d],\u201d and res \njudicata generally \u201cbar[s] a subsequent action on that \nclaim.\u201d  Cooper v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v.

Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm. Moore et \nal., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.48[3][b] (3d ed. \n2024).  A party that is even \u201cpartly to blame for the \ndelay\u201d cannot obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv.

After all, Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533.  That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).

Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv.

Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trs. of the \nUMWA Combined Benefit Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (same); People for the Ethical Treat-\nment of Animals v. United States HHS, 901 F.3d 343, \n354-55 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (same); Griffin v. Swim-Tech \nCorp.,722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir. 1984) (same); Grace \nv. Bank Leumi Tr. Co., 443 F.3d 180, 190 n.8 (2d Cir. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n \n2006) (same).4 See also 11 C. Wright, A. Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d \n293, 310 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). \nBLOM attempts to draw a distinction between \npost-judgment analyses under \u201cRules 59(e) and 60(b),\u201d \nrelying on Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v. Bos. Sci. \nScimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[w]here \na timely motion to amend judgment is filed under Rule \n59(e), the Rule 15 and 59 inquiries turn on the same \nfactors.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted); Allen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

WESLEY, \nBETH ROBINSON,\nCircuit Judges.\nFOR APPELLANTS: \nMICHAEL RADINE (Gary M. Osen,\nAaron Schlanger, on the brief),\nOsen LLC, Hackensack, NY. \nFOR APPELLEE: \nMICHAEL MCGINLEY, Dechert LLP,\nPhiladelphia, PA. \nAppeal from a judgment of the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York\n(Matsumoto, Judge). \n\nApp. 5\nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT\nIS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\nDECREED that the district court\u2019s order entered on\nApril 8, 2022 is VACATED and the case is\nREMANDED for further proceedings. \nPlaintiffs-Appellants are victims and their family\nmembers of attacks carried out by HAMAS, a group the\nUnited States has designated as a foreign terrorist\norganization. In January 2019, Plaintiffs sued\nDefendant-Appellee BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM Bank\u201d)\nfor aiding and abetting HAMAS by providing financial\nservices to certain customers Plaintiffs allege are\naffiliated with HAMAS, in violation of the Anti-\nTerrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333, as amended by the\nJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d),\nid. \u00a7 2333(d)(2). A year later, the district court\ndismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted. Honickman for\nEstate of Goldstein v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 F. Supp.\n3d 253, 271 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (\u201cHonickman I\u201d). \nOn appeal, a panel of this Court concluded that the\ndistrict court applied the wrong legal standard for\naiding-and-abetting \nliability \nunder \nJASTA.\nNonetheless, we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment\nbecause Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint still failed to state a claim\nunder the correct standard. Honickman v. BLOM Bank\nSAL, 6 F.4th 487, 490 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cHonickman II\u201d).\nArmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs\nreturned to the district court and moved under Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to vacate\nthe judgment of dismissal and grant them leave to file\na first amended complaint. The court denied Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nApp. 6\nmotion in an April 2022 order, Honickman v. BLOM\nBank SAL, No. 19-CV-0008, 2022 WL 1062315, at *5\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2022) (\u201cHonickman III\u201d), which\nPlaintiffs now appeal. We assume the parties\u2019\nfamiliarity with the underlying facts, procedural\nhistory, and arguments on appeal, to which we refer\nonly as necessary to explain our decision to vacate and\nremand. \nWe review for abuse of discretion both a district\ncourt\u2019s \u201cdenial of a motion to vacate a judgment under\nRule 60(b)(6)\u201d and its \u201cdenial of a post-judgment motion\nfor leave to replead.\u201d Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88\nF.4th 353, 359 (2d Cir. 2023).1 That means \u201cwe must\naffirm the denial of vacatur, unless the ruling is based\non an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d Id. Where, as\nhere, plaintiffs \u201cseek to file a first amended complaint\n. . . it is an abuse of discretion to deny post judgment\nrelief \u2018without any justifying reason,\u2019 such as \u2018undue\ndelay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the\nmovant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by\namendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to\nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the\namendment, [or] futility of amendment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 362\n(quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). \nWe conclude that the district court exceeded its\ndiscretion by basing its ruling on an erroneous view of\n1 In quotations from case law and the parties\u2019 briefing, this opinion\nomits all internal quotation marks, alterations, footnotes, and\ncitations, unless otherwise noted. \n\nApp. 7\nthe law because it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality\nprinciples and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal pleading principles.2\nA plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to Rule 60(b)(6)\nrelief \n\u201conly \nwhen \nthere \nare \nextraordinary\ncircumstances justifying relief, when the judgment may\nwork an extreme and undue hardship, and when the\nasserted grounds for relief are not recognized in clauses\n(1)\u2013(5) of the Rule.\u201d Metzler Investment Gmbh v.\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir.\n2020). But \u201c[w]hen vacatur is sought in order to obtain\nleave \nto \nfile \nan \namended \ncomplaint, \nspecial\nconsiderations come into play.\u201d Mandala, 88 F.4th at\n361. In such cases, the district court must give \u201cdue\nregard\u201d to \u201cboth the philosophy favoring finality of\njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of\nRule 15(a).\u201d Id. Therefore, when presented with a\nmotion to vacate and amend, the district court is\nrequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a)\nliberality in tandem. \nHere, the district court evaluated Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard. The court concluded\nthat it \u201cwould be contradictory to entertain a motion to\namend the complaint\u201d under Rule 15(a) without \u201ca\nvalid basis to vacate the previously entered judgment\u201d\nunder Rule 60(b). Honickman III, 2022 WL 1062315, at\n*2 n.2. As a result, it incorrectly treated Plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion to vacate and amend as calling for two distinct\n2 Because \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d which is a legal term of art, can\napply to determinations that do not involve \u201c\u2018abuse\u2019 in the ordinary\nsense of the word,\u201d we use the more precise term \u201cexceeded\u201d to\ndescribe the same thing.

The district\ncourt\u2019s framework for analyzing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was\nerroneous as a matter of law. \nWe accordingly vacate the district court\u2019s order and\nremand the case for the court to reconsider Plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion applying the above standards. In doing so, the\ndistrict court should balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and\nRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies, and it should\nexamine all the \u201cspecial considerations [that] come into\nplay\u201d \u201c[w]hen vacatur is sought in order to obtain leave\nto file an amended complaint.\u201d Mandala, 88 F.4th at\n361.

MATSUMOTO, United States District\nJudge: \nPlaintiffs are victims, or the relatives of victims\n(\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), of attacks conducted by Hamas, a\ndesignated Foreign Terrorist Organization (\u201cFTO\u201d),\nbetween December 2001 and August 2003 in Israel and\nthe Palestinian Territories. Plaintiffs commenced this\naction pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as\namended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism\nAct (\u201cJASTA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d), to recover damages\nfrom BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM,\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) for\nallegedly aiding and abetting Hamas\u2019 commission of\nterrorist acts by providing financial services to Hamas\n\nApp. 10\nthrough three of BLOM\u2019s customers who are alleged to\nbe Hamas affiliates: the Sanabil Association for Relief\nand Development (\u201cSanabil\u201d), Subul Al-Khair, and the\nUnion \nof \nGood \n(collectively, \nBLOM\u2019s \n\u201cThree\nCustomers\u201d). \nThis case has been closed since January 15, 2020,\nfollowing this Court\u2019s order granting Defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss and the entry of judgment. (ECF\nNo. 45.) On July 29, 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed\nthe judgment of dismissal for failure to state a claim,\nalbeit on other grounds. Presently before the Court is\nPlaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the Judgment of this Court\nwhich dismissed their Complaint with prejudice after\nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel twice declined the Court\u2019s offer to\ngrant leave to amend. (ECF No. 44, Jan. 14, 2020\nOrder; ECF No. 45, Judgment.) For the reasons\ndiscussed \nfurther \nbelow, \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion \nis\nrespectfully DENIED. \nBACKGROUND1\nPlaintiffs twice expressly declined the opportunity\nto amend their complaint prior to the Court\u2019s decision\ndated January 14, 2020: 1) on May 15, 2019 at the pre-\nmotion conference (Tr. 6:9\u201324, May 15, 2019), and 2) on\nNovember 25, 2019, at oral argument on the motion to\ndismiss. (See ECF No. 50, Pls. Pre-Motion Conference\nReq., p. 1.) On January 14, 2020, this Court issued an\nOrder granting Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice pursuant to\n1 The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts, the\npreceding procedural history, and the scope of issues presented\nbefore this Court and on appeal before the Second Circuit.\n\nApp. 11\nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. (See ECF No. 44, Order; see also ECF No. 45,\nJudgment.) Plaintiffs appealed this Court\u2019s Order and\nthe accompanying Judgment to the Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit on February 13, 2020. (ECF\nNo. 46.) On July 29, 2021, the Second Circuit in\nHonickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 6 F.4th 487 (2d Cir.\n2021), affirmed this Court\u2019s Order and judgment of\ndismissal (ECF No. 44) in Honickman for Est. of\nGoldstein v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 F. Supp. 3d 253\n(E.D.N.Y. 2020), albeit after applying a different\nstandard. Following the Second Circuit\u2019s affirmance of\nthis Court\u2019s Order, Plaintiffs filed a request for a pre-\nmotion conference on August 9, 2021, in anticipation of\ntheir motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and\n60(b)(6) to vacate the judgment and for leave to file an\namended complaint. (ECF No. 50.) Defendant opposed\nthis request. (ECF No. 51.) \nOn October 6, 2021, the Court held a pre-motion\nconference regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed motions to\n1) vacate the judgment of this Court dismissing their\nComplaint with prejudice; and 2) amend the Complaint\nthat was previously dismissed. The Court granted the\nparties leave to file written submissions only as to the\nissue of vacatur. On December 7, 2021, the Court\ngranted the parties a second opportunity to file\naccurate submissions. On December 13, 2021, Plaintiffs\nfiled a Memorandum in Support of their Motion to\nVacate Judgment (ECF No. 70), and Defendants filed\na Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Vacate\nJudgment. (ECF No. 69.) On January 3, 2022,\nPlaintiffs filed a Reply in Support of their Motion (ECF\n\nApp. 12\nNo. 73), and Defendants filed a Reply in Opposition to\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion. (ECF No. 72.) \nLEGAL STANDARD\nIt is well established that \u201c[a] party seeking to file\nan amended complaint post[-]judgment must first have\nthe judgment vacated or set aside pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 59(e) or 60(b).\u201d Metzler Inv. Gmbh v. Chipotle\nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2020)\n(citing Ruotolo v. City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 191\n(2d Cir. 2008)).2\nRule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nallows a district court to relieve a party from a\njudgment under any one of five specified reasons, none\nof which are applicable (see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5)),\nor under the sixth catch-all provision under\nRule 60(b)(6), for \u201cany other reason [that] justif[ies]\nrelief[.]\u201d Simone v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 164 F.\nApp\u2019x 39, 40 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 60(b)(6)). Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cproperly invoked only\nwhen there are extraordinary circumstances justifying\nrelief\u201d or \u201cwhen the judgment may work an extreme\nand undue hardship,\u201d Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58,\n63 (2d Cir. 1986). The Second Circuit has cautioned\n2 Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 15, it \u201cwould be contradictory to entertain a motion to\namend the complaint\u201d without \u201ca valid basis to vacate the\npreviously entered judgment.\u201d Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. of Iran v.\nM/T Stolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991). \u201cTo hold\notherwise would enable the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a)\nto be employed in a way that is contrary to the philosophy favoring\nfinality of judgments and the expeditious termination of litigation.\u201d\nMetzler, 970 F.3d at 142 (citations omitted).\n\nApp. 13\nthat \u201cmotions under Rule 60(b) are disfavored.\u201d\nSimone, 164 F. App\u2019x at 40 (citing Pichardo v. Ashcroft,\n374 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 2004)). The \u201cburden of proof is\non the party seeking relief\u201d from the judgment.\nPichardo, 374 F.3d at 55 (citation omitted). \nDISCUSSION\nFor the following reasons, the Court concludes that\nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated that relief under\nRule 60(b)(6) is warranted. As a preliminary matter,\nthe Second Circuit in Honickman affirmed this Court\u2019s\nJanuary 14, 2020, Order of dismissal, and in doing so\nspecifically held, \n[b]ecause [...] Plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege\nBLOM Bank was aware the Three Customers\nwere related to Hamas, [the Second Circuit does]\nnot need to consider whether they plausibly\nalleged the Three Customers were closely\nintertwined with Hamas\u2019s violent terrorist\nactivities. Nor do[es] [the Second Circuit] need to\naddress whether the complaint satisfies the\nsubstantial assistance element. The complaint\u2019s\nfailure to support a reasonable inference that\nBLOM Bank knew of the Three Customers\u2019 links\nto Hamas sounds the death knell of Plaintiffs\u2019\nJASTA aiding-and-abetting liability action. \nHonickman, 6 F.4th at 503. With regard to Plaintiffs\u2019\naiding-and-ability liability claim, the Court of Appeals\n\u201cacknowledge[d] that the district court\u2019s decision came\nbefore [the Second Circuit\u2019s] opinion in Kaplan [v.\nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir.\n2021)] clarified the import of our earlier JASTA aiding-\n\nApp. 14\nand-abetting precedents which may have generated\nsome \nambiguity \nas \nto \nthe \nproper \nstandard.\u201d\nHonickman, 6 F.4th at 497, n. 11. \nSecond, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary \ncircumstances\nwarranting \nrelief \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6). \nGiven\nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s potentially \u201csweeping reach, courts\nrequire the party seeking to avail itself of the Rule to\ndemonstrate \nthat \n\u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019\nwarrant relief.\u201d Stevens v. Miller, 676 F.3d 62, 67 (2d\nCir. 2012) (citing Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition\nCorp., 486 U.S. 847, 864, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d\n855 (1988); Nemaizer, 793 F.2d at 63). \nDespite the Second Circuit holding in Honickman,\n6 F.4th at 503, that Plaintiffs\u2019 aiding-and-abetting\nclaim must fail, Plaintiffs argue in support of vacatur\nthat this \u201cCourt should give Plaintiffs the opportunity\nto meet what the Circuit called the \u2018correct standard.\u2019\u201d\n(ECF No. 50, Pls. Req. for Pre-Motion Conference, p. 1.)\nPlaintiffs\u2019 unavailing argument that the Second\nCircuit\u2019s clarification of the aiding-and-abetting\nstandard constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d\nignores the long-settled proposition in the Second\nCircuit that \u201cas a general matter, a mere change in\ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary\ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d\nEmpresa Cubana Del Tabaco v. Gen. Cigar Co. Inc.,\n385 F. App\u2019x 29, 32 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Pichardo, 374\nF.3d at 56; see also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203,\n239, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997)\n(\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves\nrarely constitute the extraordinary circumstances\n\nApp. 15\nrequired for relief under Rule 60(b)(6)....\u201d)).3 The\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the judgment of dismissal\nof the complaint. This Court does not consider the\nclarification by the Second Circuit of the standard for\na successful aiding-and-abetting claim to constitute\nextraordinary circumstances meriting vacatur of this\nCourt\u2019s prior Judgment, which the Second Circuit\naffirmed after applying the clarified standard.\nPlaintiffs fail to raise any other allegedly extraordinary\ncircumstances, and do not show that any of their\nproposed new allegations were unavailable to them\nwhen given the opportunity to amend the complaint\nprior to this Court\u2019s decision on Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss. \nThird, although this Court is deeply sympathetic to\nthe Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs have not satisfied this Court\nthat denying the instant motion for vacatur would\nresult in \u201can extreme and undue hardship[.]\u201d Nemaizer,\n3 Moreover, even if changes in decisional law were appropriate\nbases for vacatur, it is not clear to this Court that the deficiencies\nidentified in Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint by this Court and the Court of\nAppeals would be impacted by the Second Circuit\u2019s clarified\nstandard for aiding-and-abetting claims. Even under the clarified\nstandard, this Court\u2019s ruling that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not\nplausibly allege that BLOM was generally aware of any connection\nbetween the Three Customers and Hamas\u201d is not meaningfully\ndifferent from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling as to this same basis for\naffirming this Court\u2019s dismissal. See Honickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d\nat 265; see also Honickman, 6 F.4th at 501 (the Second Circuit held\nthat \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 aiding-and-abetting claim fails because the\nallegations do not support an inference that BLOM Bank was\naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the\nrelevant attacks, thereby undermining the second element of\ngeneral awareness.\u201d). \n\nApp. 16\n793 F.2d at 63. Plaintiffs only summarily argue that\nthey would be \u201c[p]rejudiced and [d]efendant [w]ould\n[n]ot,\u201d and focus instead on the lack of prejudice for\nDefendant in continuing litigation if Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor vactur were granted. (ECF No. 70, Pls. Mem.,\npp. 26-27.) Fundamentally, Plaintiffs seek to amend\ntheir complaint after declining two prior opportunities\nto do so, and after unsuccessfully appealing the\ndismissal of that complaint with prejudice.4 Plaintiffs\nwill not be prejudiced by the ultimate conclusion of this\nlitigation, as Plaintiffs have had ample opportunity to\npursue all legal avenues available to them for relief.\nIndeed, Plaintiffs asserted in their opposition to the\nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that this Court should\napply the standard subsequently clarified by the\nSecond Circuit in Kaplan, 999 F.3d 842, and in the\nHonickman appeal, and the Circuit ruled in the instant\nappeal that even applying the clarified standard, the\ndismissal of the complaint was affirmed. (ECF No. 37,\nPl. Opp. Mem. pp. 10-23.) \nRelatedly, Plaintiffs concede that they twice\ndeclined the opportunity to amend their Complaint\nbefore this Court dismissed it. (ECF No. 50 at 1.) At the\nMay 15, 2019, Pre-Motion Conference, \u201c[t]he Court\noffered Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their\ncomplaint[] to add additional information in response\n4 Defendant correctly notes that Plaintiffs never appealed the\n\u201cwith prejudice\u201d aspect of the dismissal, and accordingly, waived\nit. (See ECF No. 72, p. 3); see also 18A Charles Alan Wright &\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed.\n2021) (\u201cA party who elects to appeal on one issue, omitting another\nissue on which it lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not\nappealed.\u201d). \n\nApp. 17\nto the arguments raised by Defendant. Plaintiffs\ndeclined to do so and represented that they would not\nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d\n(Min. Entry, May 15, 2019.) The Court specifically\nasked Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during the pre-motion\nconference: \u201cAre there any additional facts you could\nadd to the allegations that the defendant is challenging\nhere or are you comfortable standing on your complaint\nas it is?\u201d (Tr. 6:9\u201311, May 15, 2019.)5 Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nexpressly declined the Court\u2019s invitation to amend the\ncomplaint, stating \u201c[n]o, I think we are prepared to\nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d (Id. at 6:15\u201316.) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again\nconfirmed that Plaintiffs would not seek leave to\namend if the Court granted Defendant\u2019s motion,\nstating, \u201csitting here today based on what was\nrepresented as the arguments in the pre-motion letter,\nwe would not seek leave to amend.\u201d (Id. at 6:22\u201324.)\nSubsequently, on November 25, 2019, at oral\nargument on the motion to dismiss, this Court again\noffered, and after having reviewed the fully submitted\n5 Relatedly, during the October 6, 2021, pre-motion conference on\nthe instant motion for vacatur, the Court asked: \u201cIf the standard\nwasn\u2019t clear and you were advocating for a particular standard,\nwhy wouldn\u2019t you allege facts that met the standard that you\nthought was the right standard?\u201d (Oct. 6, 2021, Tr. at 4:23-5:1.)\nCounsel for Plaintiffs responded in relevant part, \u201cWe thought the\nallegations we had were sufficient at the time. The circuit\ndisagreed, I think, on a fairly detailed basis. As opposed to\nrejecting our theory of knowledge generally, it found fault with\nspecific deficiencies that we can address.\u201d (Id. at 5:18-22.) Counsel\nfor Plaintiffs did not explain why they did not allege facts sufficient\nto satisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\n\nApp. 18\nmotion to dismiss, Plaintiffs again expressly declined\nthe opportunity to amend their complaint. (See ECF\nNo. 50, Pls. Pre-Motion Conference Req., p. 1\n(\u201cPlaintiffs declined the opportunity to amend at the\npre-motion conference for BLOM\u2019s motion to dismiss,\nwhich declination they confirmed at oral argument.\u201d).)6\nAs this Court noted in Honickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d at\n270, the Second Circuit has clarified that a district\ncourt may dismiss a complaint without granting leave\nto amend where, as here, the Plaintiffs previously\ndeclined an opportunity to amend their complaint. See\nRosner v. Star Gas Partners, L.P., 344 F. App\u2019x 642,\n645 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order) (where plaintiffs\npreviously declined opportunities to amend prior to\ndismissal, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion\nto dismiss the Complaint with prejudice); see also\nBerman v. Morgan Keegan & Co., 455 F. App\u2019x 92, 97\n(2d Cir. 2012) (summary order) (stating that \u201ca district\ncourt does not abuse its discretion to deny a plaintiff\u2019s\nmotion to alter or amend a judgment\u201d where \u201cthe court\nexpressly invited plaintiffs to amend the Complaint,\nbut plaintiffs declined the court\u2019s invitation\u201d); Berman\nv. Morgan Keegan & Co., 455 F. App\u2019x 92, 97 (2d Cir.\n2012) (\u201ca district court does not abuse its discretion to\ndeny a plaintiffs\u2019 motion to alter or amend a judgment\u201d\nwhere \u201cplaintiffs declined the court\u2019s invitation\u201d to\n6 Notwithstanding Plaintiffs\u2019 multiple declinations of the\nopportunity to amend their complaint and their failure specifically\nto appeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d dismissal of their complaint,\nPlaintiffs do not contend that the additional facts they now propose\nto allege were not available when they declined the opportunity to\namend before the briefing, oral argument, and this Court\u2019s\ndecision.\n\nApp. 19\namend). The Court respectfully declines to grant\nPlaintiffs\u2019 request for vacatur of the judgment following\nPlaintiffs\u2019 documented series of deliberate choices not\nto cure the deficiencies identified in their pleading by\nDefendant and this Court.

They allege BLOM Bank aided and abetted\nHamas\u2019s attacks in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act\n(\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333, as amended by the Justice\nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), by\nproviding financial services to customers affiliated with\nHamas. The district court granted BLOM Bank\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (\u201cRule\n12(b)(6)\u201d), concluding that Plaintiffs-Appellants did not\nplausibly allege BLOM Bank aided and abetted\nHamas\u2019s attacks. Plaintiffs-Appellants argue that the\n\u2020 The Clerk of the Court is directed to amend the official caption as\nset forth above.\n\nApp. 24\ndistrict court misapplied the standard for JASTA\naiding-and-abetting liability, and that their complaint\nsuffices to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. Although\nwe agree that the court did not apply the proper\nstandard, Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 complaint nonetheless\nfails to state a claim. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court. \n_________________ \nMICHAEL J. RADINE (Gary M. Osen,\nAri Ungar, Aaron A.

They\nsued BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM Bank\u201d) for aiding and\nabetting Hamas\u2019s attacks by providing financial\nservices to customers affiliated with Hamas, in\nviolation of the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C.\n1 As alleged, Plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves\nand as representatives of the estates of their family members who\ndied in the attacks. \n\nApp. 25\n\u00a7 2333, as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of\nTerrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2). The United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork (Matsumoto, J.) granted BLOM Bank\u2019s motion to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that Plaintiffs\nfailed to plausibly allege BLOM Bank aided and\nabetted Hamas\u2019s attacks in violation of JASTA.\nPlaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred\nin dismissing their complaint because it applied the\nwrong standard for JASTA aiding-and-abetting\nliability. Although we agree that the court did not\napply the proper standard, we affirm its judgment\nbecause Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to state a claim\nunder the correct standard. \nBACKGROUND \nThe United States government has designated\nHamas2 as a foreign terrorist organization (\u201cFTO\u201d)\nsince 1997.3 Between December 1, 2001 and August 19,\n2003, Hamas carried out a series of attacks, including\nshootings and bombings, in Israel and the Palestinian\n2 \u201c\u2018Hamas\u2019 is an acronym for the Arabic phrase \u2018Harakat al-\nMuqawama al-Islamiya,\u2019 sometimes translated as the \u2018Islamic\nResistance Movement.\u2019 . . . In accordance with common usage, we\nrefer to it here as \u2018Hamas.\u2019\u201d Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 706 F.3d 92,\n97 n.6 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal citation omitted).\n3 The U.S. Secretary of State \u201cis authorized to designate an\norganization as a foreign terrorist organization\u201d if it \u201cengages in\nterrorist activity\u201d or \u201cretains the capability and intent to engage in\nterrorist activity\u201d and \u201cthe terrorist activity . . . threatens the\nsecurity of United States nationals or the national security of the\nUnited States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189(a)(1).\n\nApp. 26\nterritories in which Plaintiffs were injured or killed.\nBLOM Bank is a Lebanese bank that operates\ninternationally. Plaintiffs sued BLOM Bank for\ndamages under the ATA for allegedly aiding and\nabetting Hamas\u2019s attacks by providing financial\nservices to three customers affiliated with Hamas: the\nSanabil Association for Relief and Development\n(\u201cSanabil\u201d), Subul al-Khair, and the Union of Good\n(collectively, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d). \nI.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Complaint \nAs \nalleged, \nHamas \noperates \na \n\u201ccivilian\ninfrastructure\u201d called the \u201cda\u2019wa,\u201d which translates in\nArabic to \u201cthe call to the believers to shelter beneath\nthe faith\u201d and provides \u201csocial welfare activities.\u201d J.A.\n141, 141 n.6. One of the founders of Hamas explained\nin an interview in 1998 that \u201c[s]ocial work is carried\nout in support of [Hamas\u2019s aim to liberate Palestine\nfrom Israeli occupation], and it is considered to be part\nof the [Hamas] movement\u2019s strategy.\u201d Id. at 141. In the\nearly 1990s, Hamas pursued a \u201cthree-pronged strategy\u201d\nto strengthen its influence: (1) improving its military\ncapacity, (2) \u201cintensify[ing] its efforts to systematically\ngain control\u201d of institutions important to the\nPalestinian public, and (3) \u201caccelerat[ing] the\ndevelopment of its world-wide fundraising network.\u201d\nId. at 143. \nA.\nThe Three Customers: Sanabil, Subul al-\nKhair, and Union of Good \nHamas established Sanabil in 1994 \u201cwith the\nunofficial goal of competing with H[i]zbollah\u2019s [(a\ndesignated terrorist organization\u2019s)] social welfare\n\nApp. 27\ninfrastructure.\u201d Id. at 152. Sanabil was Hamas\u2019s\n\u201cda\u2019wa headquarters in Lebanon until late 2003.\u201d Id. at\n154. It distributed funds it received from Hamas\u2019s\nfundraising network to Palestinian refugee camps in\nLebanon \u201cto build [Hamas\u2019s] support within that\ncommunity.\u201d Id. at 154. Its board members were well-\nknown leaders of Hamas in Lebanon. In August 2003,\na Lebanese newspaper reported that pursuant to an\norder by a Hamas political leader, Sanabil had opened\noffices in all of the Palestinian refugee camps in\nLebanon. \u201cSanabil regularly distributed small sums in\ncash from its accounts to hundreds (if not thousands) of\nindividual dependents in the Palestinian refugee camps\nunder the categories of \u2018Orphan Sponsorships,\u2019 \u2018Student\nSponsorships,\u2019 \u2018Needy Sponsorships\u2019 and \u2018Family\nSponsorships.\u2019\u201d Id. at 159. As a Lebanese publication\nreported in 2004, Sanabil \u201csponsored 1,200 Palestinian\nfamilies and spent around $800,000 on orphans and\n$55,000 on needy patients.\u201d Id. \nOn August 22, 2003, the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury designated Sanabil as a Specially Designated\nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d),4 finding that it is \u201cpart of a\nweb of charities raising funds on behalf of [Hamas] and\nusing humanitarian[] purposes as a cover for acts that\n4 The \u201cSDGT designation is distinct from the State Department\u2019s\nFTO designation.\u201d Weiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 768 F.3d\n202, 209 n.7 (2d Cir. 2014). The Treasury Department is\nauthorized to designate groups and individuals who \u201cpose a\nsignificant risk of committing[] acts of terrorism\u201d or \u201care\ndetermined . . . to assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material,\nor technological support for . . . acts of terrorism\u201d as SDGTs under\nExecutive Order 13224.

The Treasury\nDepartment explained in a press release: \n[Hamas] recruits permanent members from the\nreligious and the poor by extending charity to\nthem from organizations such as Sanabil. . . .\nAfter starting by providing basic necessities the\ncharity eventually began asking poor families\nwithin the camps to fill out application forms,\nparticularly those who had worked with the\nIslamic Movement . . . and [Hamas]. \nId. at 155. Sanabil was also \u201cidentified . . . as an\nunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the U.S. government\u2019s\n2004 prosecution of the Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF\u201d),\na charity designated as an SDGT, which transferred\nmoney to Sanabil. Id. at 159. \nSubul al-Khair was founded in 1998 in Beirut,\nLebanon, and \u201cfunctioned much like Sanabil, but was\nmore focused on [Hamas] supporters in the Beirut\narea.\u201d Id. at 161. It \u201cregularly distributed small sums\nin cash from its accounts to individual[s] under the\ncategories of \u2018Orphan Sponsorships\u2019 and \u2018Student\nSponsorships.\u2019\u201d Id. Subul al-Khair was not designated\nas an SDGT; however, it was listed as an unindicted co-\nconspirator in HLF\u2019s criminal trial. \nUnion of Good was founded in 2000 \u201cas the umbrella\norganization for [Hamas\u2019s] global fundraising activity.\u201d\nId. at 162. It \u201coriginally began as a limited 101-day\nfundraising drive for emergency aid at the outset of\n\nApp. 29\nwhat was later called the Second Intifada.\u201d5 Id.\nBecause of its success, Union of Good became a\npermanent institution and \u201craise[d] tens of millions of\ndollars for [Hamas].\u201d Id. The U.S. Department of the\nTreasury designated Union of Good as an SDGT in\nNovember \n2008.6 \nId. \nat \n163. \nThe \nTreasury\nDepartment\u2019s press release noted: \nUnion of Good acts as a broker for [Hamas] by\nfacilitating financial transfers between a web of\ncharitable organizations\u2013\u2013including several\norganizations previously designated . . . for\nproviding support to [Hamas]\u2013\u2013and [Hamas]-\ncontrolled organizations in the West Bank and\nGaza. The primary purpose of this activity is to\nstrengthen [Hamas\u2019s] political and military\nposition in the West Bank and Gaza, including\nby: (i) diverting charitable donations to support\n[Hamas] members and the families of terrorist\noperatives; and (ii) dispensing social welfare and\nother \ncharitable \nservices \non \nbehalf \nof\n[Hamas]. . . . In addition to providing cover for\n[Hamas] financial transfers, some of the funds\n5 The \u201cSecond Intifada\u201d was \u201ca period [in the early 2000s] of\nintensified violence by Palestinian terrorist groups in the\naftermath of failed peace negotiations between Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority.\u201d See Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d\n314, 319 (2d Cir. 2018).\n6 Israel also \u201cdesignated\u201d Union of Good in 2002 \u201cin an order of the\nMinister of Defense of the State of Israel, based on its being \u2018part\nof the Hamas organization or supporting it and strengthening its\ninfrastructure.\u2019\u201d J.A. 162. The complaint does not specify what\ndesignation Israel gave Union of Good.\n\nApp. 30\ntransferred by the Union of Good have\ncompensated [Hamas] terrorists by providing\npayments to the families of suicide bombers.\u201d \nId. at 163. The chairman of Union of Good, Sheikh\nYusuf al-Qaradawi, gave interviews in 2002 and later\nyears commending Hamas\u2019s suicide attacks and\nmartyrdom operations. \nB.\nBLOM Bank\u2019s Financial Services to the\nThree Customers \nEach of the Three Customers held accounts at\nBLOM Bank. Sanabil held its account at BLOM Bank\n\u201c[d]uring the relevant period (1999-2003).\u201d Id. at 156.\nThree organizations in Hamas\u2019s fundraising network\ntransferred money to Sanabil\u2019s account at BLOM Bank.\nSpecifically: \n(1) HLF, a charity based in the U.S.,\n\u201ctransferred over $2 million . . . through BLOM\n[Bank\u2019s] correspondent bank accounts in New\nYork to Sanabil\u2019s bank account(s) at BLOM\n[Bank] in Lebanon.\u201d Id. The last payment from\nHLF to Sanabil was on September 7, 2001. The\nU.S. Department of the Treasury designated\nHLF as an SDGT on December 4, 2001; the\ncomplaint does not allege BLOM Bank processed\nany payments from HLF to Sanabil after HLF\u2019s\ndesignation. \n(2) KindHearts, a charity based in the U.S.\nwhich \u201csucceeded to HLF\u2019s fundraising for\n[Hamas] after HLF was designated,\u201d \u201csent an\nadditional $250,000 to Sanabil\u2019s accounts\nbetween July 2002 and July 2003.\u201d Id. at 158.\n\nApp. 31\nBLOM Bank processed these transfers to\nSanabil\u2019s account. The complaint does not allege\nKindHearts was designated as an SDGT. \n(3) The Al-Aqsa Foundation (\u201cAl-Aqsa\u201d), a\ncharity based in Germany, \u201ctransferred at least\n$50,000 into Sanabil\u2019s accounts at . . . BLOM\n[Bank] between April \u2013 May 2003.\u201d Id. at 158\u201359\n(emphasis omitted). Al-Aqsa was designated as\nan SDGT on May 29, 2003; BLOM Bank\nprocessed one transfer from Al-Aqsa to Sanabil\nthe day after Al-Aqsa\u2019s designation. The\ncomplaint does not allege BLOM Bank processed\nany later transfers from Al-Aqsa to Sanabil. \nIn an invoice attached as an exhibit to the\ncomplaint, the stated purpose of the payment from Al-\nAqsa to Sanabil\u2019s account at BLOM Bank was \u201chelp\nconcerning orphan children.\u201d Id. at 177\u201378. \nSubul al-Khair also maintained an account at\nBLOM Bank and BLOM Bank \u201cdeposited multiple\ntransfers sent by HLF to Subul al-Khair.\u201d Id. at 161.\n\u201cHLF sent Subul al-Khair over $500,000 between 1999\nand 2001,\u201d but the complaint does not specify whether\nBLOM Bank processed that entire amount or some\nportion of it. Id. The complaint does not provide dates\nor further information regarding the financial services\nBLOM Bank provided for Subul al-Khair. \nUnion of Good held an account with BLOM Bank.\nThe complaint does not identify any dates for this\naccount; nor does it note the transactions, if any,\nBLOM Bank processed for Union of Good. \n\nApp. 32\nII.\nApplicable Law \nThe ATA authorizes U.S. nationals \u201cinjured in his\nor her person, property, or business by reason of an act\nof international terrorism\u201d to sue for treble damages as\nwell as attorney\u2019s fees and costs.7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).\n\u201c[I]nternational terrorism\u201d encompasses \u201cactivities\nthat\u2014(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to\nhuman life that . . . would be a criminal violation if\ncommitted within the jurisdiction of the United States\nor of any State,\u201d \u201c(B) appear to be intended\u2014to (i) to\nintimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to\ninfluence the policy of a government by intimidation or\ncoercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government\nby mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping,\u201d\nand \u201c(C) occur primarily outside the territorial\njurisdiction of the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2331(1)(A)\u2013(C).\nThe ATA did not expressly permit relief against\nparties who aided the primary perpetrator of the act of\ninternational terrorism. JASTA, Pub. L. No. 114-222,\n130 Stat. 852 (2016), amended the ATA to create a\ncause of action against \u201cany person who aids and abets,\nby knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who\nconspires with the person who committed . . . an act of\ninternational terrorism.\u201d8 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).\nJASTA applies to \u201cany civil action . . . pending on, or\ncommenced on or after, the date of [its] enactment . . .\n7 Before the enactment of JASTA in 2016, the ATA did not specify\nwhich parties could be sued. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).\n8 The term \u201cperson\u201d includes corporations. See 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2333(d)(1) (incorporating the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in 1 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1).\n\nApp. 33\nand . . . arising out of an injury to a person, property, or\nbusiness on or after September 11, 2001.\u201d 130 Stat. at\n855. Congress was clear that its purpose in enacting\nJASTA was to: \n[P]rovide civil litigants with the broadest\npossible basis, consistent with the Constitution\nof the United States, to seek relief against\npersons, entities and foreign countries, wherever\nacting and wherever they may be found, that\nhave provided material support, directly or\nindirectly, to foreign organizations or persons\nthat engage in terrorist activities against the\nUnited States. \nId. at 853 (emphases added). Congress also specifically\nendorsed the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit in\nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983) in\nconducting the aiding-and-abetting analysis. Id. at 852.\n\u201cHalberstam . . . provides the proper legal framework\nfor how [aiding and abetting] liability [under the ATA]\nshould function.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). \nUnder Halberstam, there are three elements for\naiding-and-abetting liability: \u201c(1) the party whom the\ndefendant aids must perform a wrongful act that\ncauses an injury\u201d (the \u201caiding party who causes injury\u201d\nelement); \u201c(2) the defendant must be generally aware of\nhis role as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity\nat the time that he provides the assistance\u201d (the\n\u201cgeneral awareness\u201d element); \u201c(3) the defendant must\nknowingly and substantially assist the principal\nviolation\u201d (the \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d element). 705\nF.2d at 477 (emphases added). \n\nApp. 34\nIII.\nThe District Court\u2019s Decision \nThe district court granted BLOM Bank\u2019s motion to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (\u201cRule 12(b)(6)\u201d),\nconcluding that Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not plausibly\nallege that BLOM Bank aided and abetted Hamas\u2019s\nattacks. See Honickman for Est. of Goldstein v. BLOM\nBank SAL, 432 F. Supp. 3d 253, 271 (E.D.N.Y. 2020).\nIn the court\u2019s view, Plaintiffs failed to allege the latter\ntwo elements of JASTA aiding-and-abetting liability:\n\u201c(1) that [BLOM Bank] was generally aware of its role\nas part of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the\ntime that it provided the assistance, and (2) that\n[BLOM Bank] knowingly and substantially assisted the\nprincipal violation.\u201d Id. at 263 (alterations in original,\ninternal quotation marks, and citation omitted). \nAs to general awareness, the court first found\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not plausibly allege that\nBLOM [Bank] was generally aware of any connection\nbetween the Three Customers and Hamas.\u201d Id. at 265.\nIt then concluded that \u201ceven if Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations\nplausibly alleged that BLOM [Bank] knew the Three\nCustomers were related to Hamas, \u2018[e]vidence that\n[BLOM Bank] knowingly provided banking services to\n[Hamas], without more, is insufficient to satisfy\nJASTA\u2019s scienter requirement.\u2019 . . . Plaintiffs have not\nplausibly alleged that BLOM [Bank] knew that by\nproviding financial services to the Three Customers, it\nwas playing a role in Hamas\u2019s violent activities.\u201d Id. at\n265\u201366 (second alteration in original) (citation\nomitted). Regarding substantial assistance, the court\nanalyzed the six factors identified in Halberstam,\n\nApp. 35\ndiscussed below, and ruled that \u201c[t]he complaint fails\nto establish that BLOM[] [Bank\u2019s] provision of financial\nservices to the Three Customers amounted to providing\n\u2018substantial assistance\u2019 to Hamas.\u201d Id. at 268. \nPlaintiffs argue on appeal that: (1) the district court\napplied the wrong legal standard in evaluating the\nsufficiency of their complaint; and (2) their complaint\nplausibly alleges that BLOM Bank was generally\naware of its role in Hamas\u2019s illegal activities and that\nBLOM Bank knowingly provided substantial assistance\nto Hamas. \nDISCUSSION \n\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting all of the\ncomplaint\u2019s [non-conclusory] factual allegations as true\nand drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs\u2019\nfavor.\u201d Giunta v. Dingman, 893 F.3d 73, 78\u201379 (2d Cir.\n2018). It is well established that: \n[t]o survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss,\na complaint must contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face. A claim has\nfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads\nfactual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable\nfor the misconduct alleged. The plausibility\nstandard \nis \nnot \nakin \nto \na \nprobability\nrequirement, but it asks for more than a sheer\npossibility \nthat \na \ndefendant \nhas \nacted\nunlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that\nare merely consistent with a defendant\u2019s\n\nApp. 36\nliability, it stops short of the line between\npossibility and plausibility of entitlement to\nrelief. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). \nI.\nThe Standard for JASTA Aiding-and-\nAbetting Liability \nA.\nThe \u201cAiding Party Who Causes Injury\u201d\nElement \nThe first element, that \u201cthe party whom the\ndefendant aids must perform a wrongful act that\ncauses an injury,\u201d Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477, is\nstraightforward. It is satisfied when the party whom\nthe defendant directly or indirectly aided performed the\ninjury-causing act. BLOM Bank argues that Plaintiffs\u2019\ncomplaint falls short because \u201cthe only parties whom\nBLOM [Bank] allegedly \u2018aided\u2019 are the [Three]\nCustomers,\u201d and \u201cJASTA limits aiding-and-abetting\nliability to those circumstances in which a defendant\nactually \u2018aided and abetted . . . the person who\ncommitted\u2019 \nthe \nrelevant \n\u2018act \nof \ninternational\nterrorism.\u2019\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 63 (emphasis omitted)\n(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2)). We recently rejected\nthe same contention in Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian\nBank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021), holding that\n\u201c[t]he language and purpose of JASTA are meant to\nallow an aiding-and-abetting claim where the\ndefendant\u2019s acts aided and abetted the principal\u201d who\ncommitted the wrongful act \u201ceven where [the\ndefendant\u2019s] relevant substantial assistance was given\nto an intermediary\u201d of the principal. Id. at 856. \n\nApp. 37\nB.\nThe \u201cGeneral Awareness\u201d Element \nThe second (\u201cgeneral awareness\u201d) and third\n(\u201csubstantial assistance\u201d) elements form the crux of\nmost JASTA aiding-and-abetting cases. The \u201cgeneral\nawareness\u201d element requires the defendant to be\n\u201cgenerally aware\u201d of its role in \u201can overall illegal or\ntortious activity at the time that [it] provides the\nassistance.\u201d See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477 (emphasis\nadded). The defendant need not be generally aware of\nits role in the specific act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s\ninjury; instead, it must be generally aware of its role in\nan overall illegal activity from which the act that\ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was foreseeable. See id. at\n477, 488. \nHalberstam establishes this foreseeability principle.\nThere, the D.C. Circuit held that Linda Hamilton was\ncivilly liable for aiding and abetting the murder of\nMichael Halberstam during a burglary of his home by\nBernard Welch, Hamilton\u2019s partner, even though she\nwas unaware of Welch\u2019s plan to burglarize or kill\nHalberstam. See id. at 474, 488. Over the five years\nHamilton and Welch lived together, Welch acquired\nsignificant wealth by selling stolen goods that he\nobtained through burglaries. Id. at 475. Although\nHamilton was never present during Welch\u2019s burglaries\nand claimed she was unaware that they were\noccurring, she performed the \u201csecretarial work\u201d for\nWelch\u2019s illegal enterprise, such as typing transmittal\nletters for sales of the stolen goods and keeping\ninventories of the stolen goods that were sold. Id. \n\nApp. 38\nThe court concluded that the \u201csudden influx of great\nwealth\u201d Hamilton and Welch experienced, \u201cthe filtering\nof all transactions through Hamilton except payouts for\n[the] goods\u201d sold, and \u201cHamilton\u2019s collusive and\nunsubstantiated treatment of income and deductions\non her tax forms . . . combine[d] to make the district\ncourt\u2019s inference that [Hamilton] knew [Welch] was\nengaged in illegal activities acceptable, to say the\nleast.\u201d Id. at 486. Indeed, given the facts, \u201cit [would]\ndef[y] credulity that Hamilton did not know that\nsomething illegal was afoot.\u201d Id. \nHamilton\u2019s \u201cgeneral awareness of her role in\n[Welch\u2019s] continuing criminal enterprise,\u201d id. at 488,\nsufficed to establish her liability for aiding and\nabetting Halberstam\u2019s murder because the murder was\na foreseeable consequence of Welch\u2019s illegal activity. As\nthe court explained: \n[U]nder an aiding-abetting theory, [the murder]\nwas a natural and foreseeable consequence of the\nactivity Hamilton helped Welch to undertake. It\nwas \nnot \nnecessary \nthat \nHamilton \nknew\nspecifically \nthat \nWelch \nwas \ncommitting\nburglaries. Rather, when she assisted him, it\nwas enough that she knew he was involved in\nsome type of personal property crime at night\u2014\nwhether as a fence, burglar, or armed robber\nmade no difference\u2014because violence and killing\nis a foreseeable risk in any of these enterprises. \n\nApp. 39\nId. (emphases added).9 Foreseeability is thus central to\nthe Halberstam framework, and as a result, to JASTA\naiding-and-abetting liability.10 \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt, \nhowever, \nrejected \nthe\nforeseeability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough\nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM [Bank]\nwas generally aware of [its] role in terrorist activities,\nfrom which terrorist attacks were a natural and\nforeseeable consequence.\u201d Honickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d\nat 264 (first and third alterations in original)\n(emphasis, internal quotation marks, and citation\nomitted). The court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both\nHalberstam and Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d\n314 (2d Cir. 2018), one of the first cases in which we\n9 The Halberstam court extracted the foreseeability principle from\nAmerican Family Mutual Insurance Co. v. Grim, 201 Kan. 340\n(1968), in which a group of teenagers broke into a church at night\nlooking for soft drinks in the kitchen. See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at\n482. Two of them failed to extinguish the torches they used to light\ntheir way to the attic, causing the church to catch on fire. See id.\nThe defendant, one of the teenagers, did not know about the\ntorches, did not enter the attic, and was not near the church when\nit caught on fire. See id. Still, he was found liable for damages\ncaused by the fire because as part of the attempt to reach the\nchurch attic, \u201cthe need for adequate lighting could reasonably be\nanticipated,\u201d making the use of torches and subsequent fire\nforeseeable. See id. at 483 (citation omitted). \n10 Halberstam did not specifically attach foreseeability to the\ngeneral awareness or substantial assistance elements; it used\nforeseeability broadly for establishing the extent of liability under\nan aiding-and-abetting theory. See 705 F.2d at 482\u201383. As a result,\nit is more important that courts do not skip foreseeability\naltogether rather than apply it at a precise stage of the JASTA\naiding-and-abetting analysis. \n\nApp. 40\ninterpreted \naiding-and-abetting \nliability \nunder\nJASTA.11 \nLinde was brought before JASTA was enacted. The\nplaintiffs alleged that a defendant bank was liable as\na principal under the ATA for committing an act of\nterrorism by \u201cknowingly providing\u201d material support to\nan FTO in the form of \u201cfinancial services.\u201d Linde, 882\nF.3d at 318. At trial, the district court instructed the\njury that the \u201cprovision of material support to [an FTO\nin violation of a distinct statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B] . . .\nnecessarily proved the bank\u2019s commission of an act of\ninternational terrorism\u201d under the ATA. Id. at 325. We\nheld that this instruction was erroneous because\nproviding material support to an FTO does not qualify\nunder the definition of \u201can act of international\nterrorism.\u201d Id. at 326. However, the plaintiffs argued\non appeal that the availability of aiding-and-abetting\nliability under JASTA, enacted between the time of\ntrial and the appeal,12 made the error in the jury\ninstruction harmless. Id. at 328. Linde rejected their\nargument, determining that: \naiding and abetting an act of international\nterrorism requires more than the provision of\nmaterial support to a designated terrorist\n11 We acknowledge that the district court\u2019s decision came before\nour opinion in Kaplan clarified the import of our earlier JASTA\naiding-and-abetting precedents which may have generated some\nambiguity as to the proper standard.\n12 We agreed that the plaintiffs were entitled to invoke JASTA on\nappeal because the act applies retroactively. See Linde, 882 F.3d\nat 328.\n\nApp. 41\norganization. Aiding and abetting requires the\nsecondary actor to be \u2018aware\u2019 that, by assisting\nthe principal, it is itself assuming a \u2018role\u2019 in\nterrorist activities. Halberstam[], 705 F.2d at\n477. Such awareness may not require proof of\nthe specific intent demanded for criminal aiding\nand abetting culpability . . . . Nor does\nawareness require proof that Arab Bank [(the\ndefendant)] knew of the specific attacks at issue\nwhen it provided financial services for Hamas.\nWhat the jury did have to find was that, in\nproviding such services, the bank was \u2018generally\naware\u2019 that it was thereby playing a \u2018role\u2019 in\nHamas\u2019s violent or life-endangering activities.\nHalberstam[], 705 F.2d at 477. This is different\nfrom the mens rea required to establish material\nsupport in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, which\nrequires only knowledge of the organization\u2019s\nconnection to terrorism, not intent to further its\nterrorist activities or awareness that one is\nplaying a role in those activities. See Holder v.\nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 16\u201317\n. . . (2010). \nLinde, 882 F.3d at 329\u201330 (some emphases omitted and\nothers added) (footnotes and internal citation omitted).\nHere, the district court misread this passage from\nLinde to conclude that applying the Halberstam\nforeseeability standard to the \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d\nelement would contravene Linde by \u201creplac[ing] the\nscienter for aiding-and-abetting liability with the lower\nscienter required for [criminal] material support.\u201d\nHonickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d at 264. The court erred in\n\nApp. 42\nequating the foreseeability standard and the scienter\nrequired for criminal material support; the two are\ndistinct. In doing so, the court also implicitly perceived\nLinde as requiring more than the Halberstam standard\nfor general awareness, which we rejected in Kaplan.\n\u201c[N]othing in Linde repudiates the Halberstam\nstandard that a defendant may be liable for aiding and\nabetting an act of terrorism if it was generally aware of\nits role in an \u2018overall illegal activity\u2019 from which an \u2018act\nof international terrorism\u2019 was a foreseeable risk.\u201d\nKaplan, 999 F.3d at 860. Nor could it, of course, given\nCongress\u2019s unambiguous assignment of Halberstam as\nthe appropriate legal framework for JASTA aiding-and-\nabetting liability. Linde\u2019s holding that aiding-and-\nabetting \u201crequires more than the provision of material\nsupport to a terrorist organization,\u201d 882 F.3d at 329,\nmeans only that allegations that a defendant\n\u201cknowingly provid[ed] material support to an FTO,\nwithout more, does not as a matter of law satisfy the\ngeneral awareness element.\u201d Kaplan, 999 F.3d at 860\n(emphasis added). That language \u201cdoes not establish\nthat [a defendant\u2019s provision of] material support to an\nFTO is never sufficient for [JASTA] aiding-and-abetting\nliability.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Instead, \u201c[w]hether a\ndefendant\u2019s material support to an FTO suffices to\nestablish general awareness is a fact-intensive inquiry\u201d\ndepending on allegations that a defendant \u201cwas\ngenerally aware . . . that it was playing a role in\nunlawful activities from which [terrorist] attacks were\nforeseeable.\u201d Id. at 860\u201361 (emphasis added). \nOn the other hand, we reject Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to\nequate the Halberstam foreseeability standard with the\n\nApp. 43\n\u201cfungibility\u201d theory in Holder v. Humanitarian Law\nProject, 561 U.S. 1 (2010). Linde recognized that\ngeneral awareness \u201cis different from the mens rea\nrequired to establish material support in violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, which requires only knowledge of the\norganization\u2019s connection to terrorism . . . . See\nHolder[,] 561 U.S. [at] 16\u201317.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at\n329\u201330. In Holder, a criminal material support case\nunder \u00a7 2339B, the plaintiffs13 knowingly provided\nmaterial support to FTOs but claimed they were\n\u201cseek[ing] to facilitate only the lawful, nonviolent\npurposes of those groups.\u201d 561 U.S. at 7\u20138. The\nSupreme Court determined that for the purpose of\n\u00a7 2339B, it did not matter that the \u201c[m]aterial support\n[was] meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct\u201d\nbecause \u201c[m]oney is fungible\u201d and \u201cthere is reason to\nbelieve that foreign terrorist organizations do not\nmaintain legitimate financial firewalls between those\nfunds raised for civil, nonviolent activities, and those\nultimately \nused \nto \nsupport \nviolent, \nterrorist\noperations.\u201d Id. at 30\u201331 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). \nPlaintiffs urge us to adopt Holder\u2019s \u201cfungibility\u201d\nrationale in assessing the sufficiency of their\ncomplaint. They contend that Linde merely recognized\nthat the mens rea for aiding and abetting is \u201cdifferent\u201d\nfrom criminal material support, not that it is \u201chigher.\u201d\nAppellants\u2019 Br. at 44. However, Linde determined that\n13 The plaintiffs were U.S. organizations and citizens who\nchallenged the constitutionality of the criminal material support\nstatute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B) and sought an injunction to prohibit its\nenforcement. See Holder, 561 U.S. at 10\u201311.\n\nApp. 44\nthe facts in Holder\u2013\u2013adequate for criminal material\nsupport\u2013\u2013fall short for the general awareness element\nof JASTA aiding and abetting. 882 F.3d at 329\u201330.\nIndeed, Linde could not have been clearer: aiding and\nabetting \u201crequires more than the provision of material\nsupport to a designated terrorist organization,\u201d 882\nF.3d at 329. Plaintiffs\u2019 fungibility argument would\ndisplace the aiding-and-abetting standard with the\nstandard for criminal material support by making\n\u201cknowingly providing material support to an FTO,\nwithout more\u201d sufficient \u201cas a matter of law\u201d for the\ngeneral awareness element. See Kaplan, 999 F.3d at\n860. Not only would this erase Linde\u2019s distinction\nbetween general awareness and criminal material\nsupport, but it would also evade Halberstam\u2019s\nforeseeability standard.14\nAccordingly, the relevant inquiry for the general\nawareness element is: did Plaintiffs \u201cplausibly allege[]\nthe [Three] Customers were so closely intertwined with\n[Hamas\u2019s] violent terrorist activities that one can\n14 Plaintiffs rely on Boim v. Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev.,\n549 F.3d 685 (7th Cir. 2008), a pre-JASTA case in which the\nSeventh Circuit held that the causation element of primary\nliability under the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), is satisfied when the\ndefendant knowingly donated money to a terrorist organization\nbecause \u201c[a]nyone who knowingly contributes to the nonviolent\nwing of an organization that he knows to engage in terrorism is\nknowingly contributing to the organization\u2019s terrorist activities.\u201d\n549 F.3d at 698. Boim is inapposite. It was decided before\nCongress assigned Halberstam as the appropriate framework for\nJASTA aiding-and-abetting liability claims and therefore lacks the\nrequisite analysis. Moreover, any persuasive value it might have\nis insufficient to overcome the binding effects of Linde and Kaplan\non us.\n\nApp. 45\nreasonably infer that [BLOM Bank] was generally\naware while it was providing banking services to those\nentities that it was playing a role in unlawful activities\nfrom which [Hamas\u2019s] attacks were foreseeable[?]\u201d15\nKaplan, 999 F.3d at 860\u201361. \nC.\nThe \u201cSubstantial Assistance\u201d Element \nThe last element for aiding-and-abetting liability\nrequires \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \n\u201cknowingly \nand\nsubstantially assist[ed] the principal violation.\u201d\nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477. As the analysis in\nHalberstam reveals, the \u201cprincipal violation\u201d must be\nforeseeable from the illegal activity that the defendant\nassisted; knowing and substantial assistance to the\nactual injury-causing act\u2013\u2013here, Hamas\u2019s attacks\u2013\u2013is\nunnecessary. See id. at 488. \nThe district court appeared to impose a higher\nstandard on the \u201cknowing\u201d prong of \u201cknowingly and\nsubstantially\u201d assisted than required, concluding that\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails plausibly to allege that any\nassistance \nBLOM \n[Bank] \nprovided\u2013\u2013even \nif\nsubstantial\u2013\u2013would have been knowing.\u201d Honickman,\n432 F. Supp. 3d at 268. The \u201cknowledge component\u201d is\nsatisfied \u201c[i]f the defendant knowingly\u2013\u2013and not\ninnocently \nor \ninadvertently\u2013\u2013gave \nassistance.\u201d16\n15 Contrary to BLOM Bank\u2019s argument, the Three Customers do\nnot themselves need to be \u201cengaged in . . . violent or terrorist acts.\u201d\nSee Appellee\u2019s Br. at 32\u201334. \n16 BLOM Bank argues in its post-argument letter brief that under\nKaplan, \u201cwhere a complaint alleges that the assistance was\nindirect, it must allege (among other things) that the defendant\nhad \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of the intermediary\u2019s connection to the\n\nApp. 46\nKaplan, 999 F.3d at 864. For instance, Halberstam held\nthat \u201cthe district court . . . justifiably inferred that\nHamilton assisted Welch with knowledge that he had\nengaged in illegal acquisition of goods.\u201d 705 F.2d at\n488. It did not require Hamilton to \u201cknow\u201d anything\nmore about Welch\u2019s unlawful activities than what she\nknew for the general awareness element. \nHow much aid qualifies as substantial assistance?\nHalberstam identified six factors: \n(1) the nature of the act encouraged, (2) the\namount of assistance given by defendant,\n(3) defendant\u2019s presence or absence at the time \nof the tort, (4) defendant\u2019s relation to the\nprincipal, (5) defendant\u2019s state of mind, and\n(6) the period of defendant\u2019s assistance. \nLinde, 882 F.3d at 329 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d at\n484\u201385). No factor is dispositive; the weight accorded\nto each is determined on a case-by-case basis. See\nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 483; see also Kaplan, 999 F.3d\nat 856. \nThe district court misunderstood the first factor,\n\u201cthe nature of the act encouraged,\u201d to be a question of\nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u201cthat BLOM\n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent\nactivities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019\nFTO.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Letter Br. at 14. Kaplan did not so hold; instead,\nit asserted \u201cthe actual knowledge component of the Halberstam\nstandard requires that the defendant \u2018know[ ]\u2019 that it is providing\n\u2018assistance,\u2019 . . . whether directly to the FTO or indirectly through\nan intermediary.\u201d 999 F.3d at 863\u201364 (alteration in original)\n(citation omitted).\n\nApp. 47\ninjuries.\u201d Honickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d at 268. However,\nthe \u201cnature of the act involved dictates what aid might\nmatter.\u201d17 See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 484 (emphasis\nomitted). As a result, the factor requires assessing\nwhether the alleged aid (facilitating the transfer of\nmillions of dollars to the Three Customers) would be\nimportant to the nature of the injury-causing act\n(Hamas\u2019s terrorist attacks). \nFor the second factor, the \u201camount of assistance,\u201d\nthe district court held \u201cPlaintiffs make no non-\nconclusory assertions that any of the funds processed\nby the Three Customers actually went to Hamas, or\nthat BLOM [Bank], at the time it provided banking\nservices to the Three Customers, was aware or\nintended that Hamas would receive the corresponding\nfunds.\u201d Honickman, 432 F. Supp. 3d at 268. However,\nPlaintiffs did not need to allege the funds \u201cactually\nwent to Hamas.\u201d Factual allegations that permit a\nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized the\nmoney it transferred to its customers would be received\nby the FTO would suffice. See Kaplan, 999 F.3d at 866.\nIn other words, if a plaintiff plausibly alleges the\ngeneral awareness element, she does not need to also\nallege the FTO actually received the funds. Instead, the\ninquiry should focus on the amount and type of aid the\ndefendant provided. See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488.\nLastly, the fourth factor, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s relation\nto the principal,\u201d is useful for determining the\n17 For example, verbal encouragement of \u201cphysical acts of violence\u201d\nmay be important to a principal\u2019s commission of battery. See\nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 484.\n\nApp. 48\ndefendant\u2019s capacity to assist. See id. at 484. The\ndistrict court erroneously construed this Court\u2019s finding\nin Siegel v. HSBC N. Am. Holdings, Inc., 933 F.3d 217\n(2d Cir. 2019), that \u201cthe plaintiffs d[id] not plead any\nnon-conclusory allegations that [the defendant-bank]\nhad any relationship with [the FTO]\u201d to mean that\nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between\nBLOM Bank and Hamas. Id. at 225; see Honickman,\n432 F. Supp. 3d at 269. In Siegel, the defendant-bank\u2019s\n\u201crelation to the principal\u201d was several steps removed:\nit allegedly had a commercial relationship with another\nbank that was linked to various terrorist organizations\nincluding the FTO that caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\nSee 933 F.3d at 220\u201321. Although the relationship\nbetween the defendant and the FTO should not be so\nattenuated as in Siegel, a direct relationship between\nthe defendant and the FTO is not required to satisfy\nthis factor. \nII.\nThe Sufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint\nFor Plaintiffs\u2019 JASTA aiding-and-abetting claim to\nbe viable, the complaint must plausibly allege all three\nelements of the Halberstam standard for aiding-and-\nabetting liability. \nThe first element, that the party whom the\ndefendant aided performed the injury-causing act,\nmerits little attention. Plaintiffs plausibly allege that\nthe party whom BLOM Bank aided (indirectly),\nHamas, committed attacks causing Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\nFor the second element, general awareness, the\ncomplaint must plausibly allege: (1) as a threshold\nrequirement, that BLOM Bank was aware of the Three\nCustomers\u2019 connections with Hamas before the\n\nApp. 49\nrelevant attacks; and (2) the Three Customers were so\nclosely intertwined with Hamas\u2019s violent terrorist\nactivities that one can reasonably infer BLOM Bank\nwas generally aware of its role in unlawful activities\nfrom which the attacks were foreseeable while it was\nproviding financial services to the Three Customers.\nSee Kaplan, 999 F.3d at 860. For the final element of\nsubstantial assistance, the complaint must contain\nsufficient factual allegations relating to the six factors\nidentified above. \nWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 aiding-and-abetting\nclaim fails because the allegations do not support an\ninference that BLOM Bank was aware of the Three\nCustomers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the relevant\nattacks, thereby undermining the second element of\ngeneral awareness. In assessing this element, the\ndistrict court found that the complaint\u2019s references to\nmedia articles and publications on the Three\nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient\nbecause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that\nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have known\nof any of the cited sources.\u201d Honickman, 432 F. Supp.\n3d at 265. However, as we explained in Kaplan,\nPlaintiffs did not need to allege that BLOM Bank knew\nor should have known of the public sources at the\npleading stage. See 999 F.3d at 865. Such a\nrequirement at this juncture would be too exacting.\nNevertheless, the public sources cited in the\ncomplaint do not plausibly support an inference that\nBLOM Bank had the requisite general awareness at\nthe time that it provided banking services to the Three\nCustomers. See Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477 (\u201c[T]he\n\nApp. 50\ndefendant must be generally aware of [its] role . . . at\nthe time that [it] provides the assistance.\u201d) (emphasis\nadded). One of the news articles on Sanabil referenced\nin the complaint was dated August 27, 2004, more than\na year after the last relevant attack, and reported only\nthat Sanabil sponsored Palestinian families and spent\nmoney on orphans. The Lebanese press\u2019s coverage of\nSanabil\u2019s center in Sidon closing due to \u201cits links to\n[Hamas]\u201d is undated. J.A. 159. The complaint lacks any\nallegations that at the time of the interviews in which\nal-Qaradawi\u2013\u2013who chaired Union of Good\u2013\u2013praised\nmartyrdom \nand \ncriticized \nthe \nUnited \nStates\u2019\ndesignation of Hamas, it was public knowledge that al-\nQaradawi chaired Union of Good.18 Indeed, the\nTreasury Department\u2019s press release, announcing the\ndesignation of Sanabil and similar organizations as\nSDGTs only after the final attack at issue, describes\nthese organizations as using \u201chumanitarian[] . . .\npurposes as a cover for acts that support [Hamas],\u201d\nwhich the Treasury Department unveiled only after\ndeveloping \u201ccredible evidence\u201d in an investigation. J.A.\n147 (emphasis added). That organizations like the\nThree Customers maintained a \u201ccover\u201d in public\nundermines the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 theory that\n18 Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe publicly available evidence [in the\ncomplaint] was largely available before or during the relevant\nperiod or discussed facts that were previously knowable.\u201d\nAppellants\u2019 Br. at 39, n.11. However, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence\nis not the same as public sources such as media articles. The latter,\ndepending on their substance, plausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s\nknowledge which can be confirmed during discovery, whereas the\nformer requires the implausible inference that the defendant was\naware of those facts even before the news media. \n\nApp. 51\nBLOM Bank understood these organizations\u2019 true\nnature and activities from the public record at the time.\nThe limited public sources Plaintiffs cite pale in\ncomparison to the detailed, numerous sources that\nsufficed in Kaplan. See 999 F.3d at 864. The Kaplan\ncomplaint alleged Hizbollah made public statements\nidentifying the defendant-bank\u2019s customers as \u201cintegral\nparts of Hizbollah\u201d prior to the relevant attacks which\nwere \u201cspecific as to the status of the speaker,\u201d \u201cthe\ncircumstances in which the statements were made,\u201d\nand \u201cthe other specific media in which they were\nmade,\u201d including Hizbollah\u2019s own websites. Id. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 remaining allegations also fail to suggest\nBLOM Bank was aware of the connections between the\nThree Customers and Hamas.19 The complaint alleges\ncertain leaders of Hamas were board members of the\nThree Customers but does not aver that this was public\nknowledge during the relevant period. Sanabil and\nSubul al-Khair were identified as unindicted co-\nconspirators in HLF\u2019s criminal trial and/or prosecution,\nbut HLF was not indicted until 2004, after the relevant\nperiod. Sanabil and Union of Good were not designated\n19 Plaintiffs referenced in their briefs and at oral argument a 2001\nFBI report identifying Sanabil as a \u201cknown front[]\u201d for Hamas. See\nAppellants\u2019 Br. at 32; Appellants\u2019 Letter Br. at 11. Their complaint\ncontained no reference to this FBI report. Similarly, Plaintiffs\ncharacterized BLOM Bank\u2019s transactions for the Three Customers\nas \u201cuntraceable\u201d for the first time in their post-argument letter\nbrief. See, e.g., Appellants\u2019 Letter Br. at 8. \u201c[A] Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion tests the adequacy of the complaint . . . not the briefs.\u201d\nHack v. President & Fellows of Yale Coll., 237 F.3d 81, 91 (2d Cir.\n2000), abrogated on other grounds by Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,\n534 U.S. 506 (2002), (internal citation omitted). \n\nApp. 52\nas SDGTs until after the last relevant attack, and\nBLOM Bank did not transfer any funds from non-\ncustomer charities after they were designated as\nSDGTs except for one transfer from Al-Aqsa to Sanabil\nthe day after Al-Aqsa\u2019s designation. We agree with the\ndistrict court that this single post-designation transfer,\nstanding alone, is insufficient to suggest BLOM Bank\nwas aware of Sanabil\u2019s links to Hamas.20\nBecause we conclude Plaintiffs failed to plausibly\nallege BLOM Bank was aware the Three Customers\nwere related to Hamas, we do not need to consider\nwhether they plausibly alleged the Three Customers\nwere closely intertwined with Hamas\u2019s violent terrorist\nactivities.21 Nor do we need to address whether the\n20 The allegation that Israel designated Al-Aqsa as a terrorist\norganization in 1998, without specifying whether and where this\nwas made public, is also unavailing. Moreover, even if the complaint\nplausibly alleged it was public knowledge that Al-Aqsa, HLF, and\nKindHearts were linked with Hamas, those entities were not BLOM\nBank\u2019s customers. Without any further allegations, a defendant-\nbank\u2019s transfers of funds from non-customers associated with an\nFTO to the defendant\u2019s customers does not compel an inference that\nthe defendant knew of its customers\u2019 connections to that FTO.\n21 However, we note that there is a meaningful difference between\nthe alleged functions of the Three Customers and those of the\ncustomers in Kaplan. In Kaplan, the plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that the\ndefendant-bank\u2019s customers provided subsidies to the families of\nHizbollah \nsuicide \nbombers\u2013\u2013i.e., \nveterans\u2019 \nfunds \nfor\nterrorists\u2013\u2013and the defendant-bank \u201cpermitted the laundering of\nmoney . . . in violation of regulatory restrictions meant to hinder\nthe ability of FTOs to carry out terrorist attacks.\u201d 999 F.3d at 858,\n865. By contrast, Plaintiffs\u2019 theory rests on the da\u2019wa, Hamas\u2019s\nsocial welfare program, and the Three Customers were alleged\nonly to have supported orphans in Palestinian refugee camps. \n\nApp. 53\ncomplaint satisfies the substantial assistance element.\nThe complaint\u2019s failure to support a reasonable\ninference that BLOM Bank knew of the Three\nCustomers\u2019 links to Hamas sounds the death knell of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 JASTA aiding-and-abetting liability action.\nCONCLUSION \nWe AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\nApp. 54\n                         \nAPPENDIX D\n                         \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n19-cv-00008(KAM)(SMG)\n[Filed January 14, 2020]\n__________________________________________\nMICHAL HONICKMAN for the ESTATE \n)\nOF HOWARD GOLDSTEIN, et al., \n)\nPlaintiffs, \n)\n)\nv. \n)\n)\nBLOM BANK SAL, \n)\nDefendant. \n)\n_________________________________________ )\nMEMORANDUM & ORDER \nPlaintiffs are victims, or the relatives of victims, of\nattacks conducted by Hamas, a designated Foreign\nTerrorist Organization (\u201cFTO\u201d),1 between December\n2001 and August 2003 in Israel and the Palestinian\nTerritories (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d). Plaintiffs commenced this\n1 A Foreign Terrorist Organization is an organization designated\nby the U.S. Secretary of State pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189(a)\nbecause it \u201cengages in terrorist activity\u201d or \u201cretains the capability\nand intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism.\u201d 31 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 597.309; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189(a). Hamas was designated an FTO on\nOctober 8, 1997. Designation of Foreign Terrorist Organizations,\n62 Fed. Reg. 52,650 (Oct. 8, 1997). \n\nApp. 55\naction pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as\namended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism\nAct (\u201cJASTA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d), to recover damages\nfrom BLOM Bank SAL (\u201cBLOM,\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d) for\nallegedly aiding and abetting Hamas\u2019 commission of\nterrorist acts by providing financial services to Hamas\nthrough three of BLOM\u2019s customers who are alleged to\nbe Hamas affiliates: the Sanabil Association for Relief\nand Development (\u201cSanabil\u201d), Subul Al-Khair, and the\nUnion \nof \nGood \n(collectively, \nBLOM\u2019s \n\u201cThree\nCustomers\u201d). These organizations are alleged to have\nengaged in non-violent conduct in furtherance of\nHamas\u2019 goals. \nDefendant moves to dismiss the complaint pursuant\nto Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\narguing that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged the\nelements of JASTA aiding-and-abetting liability as set\nforth in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir.\n1983), and adopted by the Second Circuit in Linde v.\nArab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).\nSpecifically, Defendant argues that the complaint does\nnot plausibly allege that BLOM (1) aided the persons or\nentity who carried out the attacks which caused their\ninjuries, (2) was generally aware that, by providing\nfinancial services to the Three Customers, it was\nplaying a role in Hamas\u2019 violent or life-endangering\nactivities (the \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d element), or\n(3) knowingly provided substantial assistance to\nHamas (the \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d element). \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not plausibly allege the\ngeneral awareness or the substantial assistance\n\nApp. 56\nelements necessary to plead JASTA aiding-and-\nabetting liability. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for\nfailure to state a claim is GRANTED. \nBackground2 \nPlaintiffs are individuals, or the relatives of\nindividuals, who suffered injuries in one of twelve\nviolent attacks carried out by Hamas in Israel and the\nPalestinian Territories between December 1, 2001 and\nAugust 19, 2003. (See ECF No. 1, Complaint (\u201cCompl.\u201d),\n\u00b6 1.) Plaintiffs sue Defendant, a major bank\nheadquartered in Beirut, Lebanon (id. \u00b6 504-05), for\nallegedly aiding-and-abetting Hamas\u2019 commission of\nterrorist attacks, like those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019\ninjuries. \nMuch of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is dedicated to\ndescribing Hamas\u2019 use of a civil infrastructure, which\nPlaintiffs call its \u201cda\u2019wa,\u201d to compete with other\norganizations for support in the areas in which it\noperates. (See Compl. \u00b6 511, n.6.) It appears that the\ncomplaint\u2019s focus on Hamas\u2019 da\u2019wa is predicated on\nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability, that BLOM is liable\nbecause it provided financial services to its Three\nCustomers, all of which are alleged to be \u201cda\u2019wa\ninstitutions in Lebanon tasked by Hamas to extend\n[its] reach into [local] Palestinian refugee camps\u201d\nthrough the provision of charitable services and\n2 The facts in this section are derived from Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\nand are accepted as true for purposes of this Memorandum and\nOrder.\n\nApp. 57\nfinancial support to the local populations. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 526,\n610-11, 626.) \nI.\nThe Three Customers \nBecause BLOM\u2019s alleged liability turns principally\non its knowing conduct, and because its alleged\nprovision of support to Hamas is indirect, the court\nreviews in detail Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the\nrelationship between each of the three BLOM account\nholders with Hamas, Hamas\u2019 activities, and BLOM\u2019s\nalleged knowledge or awareness of the relevant facts.\nA. Sanabil \n\u201cHamas established [the] Sanabil Association for\nRelief and Development\u201d in 1994. (Id. \u00b6 574.) Sanabil\nserved as \u201cHamas\u2019 da\u2019wa headquarters in Lebanon\nuntil late 2003.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 588.) \u201cBetween 1998 and 2001,\n[Sanabil] received millions of dollars in support from\nHamas\u2019 fundraising network\u201d and \u201cchanneled those\nfunds to the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to\nbuild Hamas\u2019 support within that community.\u201d (Id.)\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allege that Sanabil is, in sum and\nsubstance, an alter ego of Hamas and, thus, BLOM is\nliable. As noted above, because knowledge is an\nintegral component of a claim for civil aiding-and-\nabetting liability, the court considers which, if any, of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations support the position that BLOM\nknew of Sanabil\u2019s alleged relationship with Hamas or\nSanabil\u2019s alleged involvement in Hamas\u2019 violent acts at\nthe time BLOM provided financial services to Sanabil.\n\nApp. 58\n1. Sanabil\u2019s Connection to Hamas \nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM knew or was\naware of a relationship between Sanabil and Hamas.\nInstead, Plaintiffs cite to several public statements and\ndevelopments, or facts alleged to be within the public\nknowledge, from which Plaintiffs assert it could be\nplausibly inferred that BLOM was aware of a nexus\nbetween Sanabil and Hamas. These include: \n\u2022\nThe August 22, 2003 designation of Sanabil\nas a Specially Designated Global Terrorist\n(\u201cSDGT\u201d)3 by the U.S. Treasury Department\nand accompanying press release, which\nstated that Sanabil \u201creceives large quantities\nof funds raised by major Hamas-affiliated\ncharities . . . and, in turn, provides funding to\nHamas\u201d (id. \u00b6 590); \n\u2022\nAn August 23, 2003 report published by a\nLebanese newspaper, Al-Saffir, stating that\nin August 2001, following an order given by\nan unspecified Hamas leader, Sanabil opened\noffices in Palestinian refugee camps in\nLebanon to \u201cincrease its activity\u201d (id. \u00b6 589); \n3 The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl\u2019s \u201cSDGT designation is distinct from the State\nDepartment\u2019s FTO designation.\u201d Weiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank\nPLC, 768 F.3d 202, 209 (2d Cir. 2014). The Specially Designated\nGlobal Terrorist designation covers, inter alia, foreign persons who\n\u201cpose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that\nthreaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security,\nforeign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d 31 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 594.310, 594.201(a). \n\nApp. 59\n\u2022\nUndated \u201creports\u201d that in 2003, following a\nruling from the Lebanese judiciary, the\nSanabil organization in the town of Sidon\nclosed, which closure was attributed to\nSanabil\u2019s links to Hamas (id. \u00b6 609), with the\nonly example of such a report being an\nAugust 27, 2004 article published by a\nLebanese newspaper, The Daily Star (id.\n\u00b6 610). \nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM knew of the\naforementioned facts. Moreover, none of the public\nstatements cited in the complaint was published until\nafter the last attack. \nPlaintiffs also allege that BLOM\u2019s knowledge of a\nnexus between Sanabil and Hamas could be inferred\nfrom the fact that Sanabil received payments from\norganizations later revealed to be affiliated with\nHamas. The following provides a brief overview of the\npayments Sanabil received from organizations with\nalleged affiliations with Hamas: \n\u2022\nHoly Land Foundation (\u201cHLF\u201d). HLF was a\nU.S.-based charitable organization founded\nin October 1993. (Id. \u00b6 555, 560.) BLOM\nprocessed roughly $1 million in payments in\n2000 and $350,000 in 2001 from HLF to\nSanabil \nthrough \nBLOM\u2019s \nNew \nYork\ncorrespondent accounts. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 596-99.) The\ndate of the last payment was September 7,\n2001. (Id. \u00b6 599.) The U.S. Treasury\nDepartment designated HLF as an SDGT on\nDecember 4, 2001. (Id. \u00b6 567.) BLOM is not\nalleged to have processed any transactions\n\nApp. 60\nfrom HLF to Sanabil following HLF\u2019s\ndesignation as an SDGT. \n\u2022\nKindHearts. Kindhearts was a U.S.-based\ncharitable organization founded in January\n2002. (Id. \u00b6 615.) Sanabil received $250,000\nfrom KindHearts between July 2002 and\nJuly 2003 (id. \u00b6 603). The U.S. Treasury\nDepartment \nfirst \ntook \naction \nagainst\nKindhearts on February 19, 2006, when it\nfroze the organization\u2019s accounts (id. \u00b6 619),\nwell after the last of the attacks at issue in\nthis action on August 19, 2003 (id. \u00b6 76).4 \n\u2022\nAl-Aqsa Foundation (\u201cAl-Aqsa\u201d). Al-Aqsa was\na Germany-based charitable organization\nfounded in July 1991. (Id. \u00b6 549.) Sanabil\nreceived at least $50,000 from Al-Aqsa\nbetween April and May 2003. (Id. \u00b6 604.) The\nU.S. Treasury Department designated Al-\nAqsa an SDGT on May 29, 2003 due to its\nconnection with Hamas. (Id. \u00b6 553-54.)\nBLOM processed one transfer from Al-Aqsa\nto Sanabil the day after its designation, but\nPlaintiffs do not allege any later transfers\nfrom Al-Aqsa to Sanabil\u2019s account at BLOM.\n(Id. \u00b6 605.)5 \n4 Defendant notes that \u201cthe United States is not alleged to have\never designated KindHearts \u2014 a U.S. organization \u2014 as an\nSDGT.\u201d (ECF No. 36-1, Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def.\u2019s Mot. to\nDismiss (\u201cDef. Br.\u201d) at 10.) \n5 Plaintiffs allege that Israel outlawed Al-Aqsa in May 1997 and\ndeclared it a terrorist organization in January 1998 (id. \u00b6 550), and\n\nApp. 61\nWith one exception, BLOM did not process any\npayments from the aforementioned organizations to\nSanabil after the U.S. Treasury Department took\naction against them, including by designating two of\nthem as SDGTs. \n2. Sanabil\u2019s \nConnection \nto \nHamas\u2019\nViolent Acts \nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM knew of a nexus\nbetween Sanabil and Hamas\u2019 violent acts, or that\nSanabil itself played a role in Hamas\u2019 violent activities.\nRather, the allegations in the complaint suggest that\nSanabil engaged in charitable acts rather than any acts\nrelated to terrorism: \n\u2022\nAn August 27, 2004 article published by The\nDaily Star stated that Sanabil \u201chad\nsponsored 1,200 Palestinian families and\nspent around $800,000 on orphans and\n$55,000 on needy patients\u201d (id. \u00b6 610); \n\u2022\n\u201cRecords seized from HLF show that Sanabil\nregularly distributed small sums in cash\nfrom its accounts to hundreds (if not\nthat Germany closed Al-Aqsa\u2019s offices in July 2002 due to its\nsupport of violence as a means to achieve ends (but not specifically\ndue to its links to Hamas) (id. \u00b6 551-52). Plaintiffs do not allege\nthat BLOM maintains an office in Germany or Israel or knew or\nwould otherwise have any reason to know of these developments.\n(Accord Def. Br. at 7 (stating that BLOM \u201cis actively present in 12\ncountries, serving the niche market of Lebanese and Arab\nexpatriates and business people in Europe, but has no operations\nin the United States or in Israel, where all of the alleged [a]ttacks\noccurred\u201d).) \n\nApp. 62\nthousands) of individual dependents in the\nPalestinian \nrefugee \ncamps \nunder \nthe\ncategories of \u2018Orphan Sponsorships,\u2019 \u2018Student\nSponsorships,\u2019 \u2018Needy Sponsorships\u2019 and\n\u2018Family Sponsorships\u2019\u201d (id. \u00b6 611); and \n\u2022\nThe only invoice attached to Plaintiffs\u2019\ncomplaint which indicates a \u201cpurpose\u201d for a\npayment \nSanabil \nreceived \nfrom \nthe\naforementioned organizations states that it\nwas for \u201chelp concerning orphan children\u201d\n(id.

But\nSanabil is not alleged to have engaged in any violent\nacts, either on its own or in conjunction with Hamas. \nB. Subul Al-Khair \nPlaintiffs allege fewer details regarding Subul Al-\nKhair. Subul Al-Khair \u201cis a small Hamas institution\nfounded in Beirut, Lebanon in 1998.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 621.)\nDefendant maintained an account for Subul Al-Khair\nat its Rawsheh branch in Beirut and \u201cdeposited [over\n$500,000] in transfers sent by HLF to Subul Al-Khair\u201d\nbetween 1999 and 2001. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 623, 625.) Plaintiffs do\nnot specify the date of the last HLF payment to Subul\nAl-Khair in 2001, but there is no allegation that it\noccurred after the December 4, 2001 designation of\nHLF as an SDGT by the U.S. Treasury Department (id.\n\u00b6 567). \n\nApp. 63\n1. Subul Al-Khair\u2019s Connection to Hamas\nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM knew of Subul\nAl-Khair\u2019s nexus to Hamas, nor do Plaintiffs cite any\npublic \nstatements \nregarding \nSubul \nAl-Khair\u2019s\nrelationship with Hamas. Plaintiffs\u2019 only allegation\nsuggesting that BLOM was aware of a nexus between\nSubul Al-Khair and Hamas is that \u201cSubul al-Khair was\nidentified as an unindicted co-conspirator in HLF\u2019s\ncriminal trial\u201d (id. \u00b6 622), but this trial did not begin\nuntil sometime in 2004 (id. \u00b6 567), well after the\ntransactions BLOM processed on behalf of Subul Al-\nKhair. \n2. Subul \nAl-Khair\u2019s \nConnection \nto\nHamas\u2019 Violent Acts \nPlaintiffs\u2019 similarly do not allege that BLOM was\naware of a connection between Subul Al-Khair and\nHamas\u2019 violent activities, or that any such nexus\nexisted. The complaint states that \u201cSubul al-Khair\nfunctioned much like Sanabil, but was more focused on\nHamas supporters in the Beirut area.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 624.)\nSubul Al-Khair \u201cregularly distributed small sums in\ncash from its accounts to individual[s] under the\ncategories of \u2018Orphan Sponsorships\u2019 and \u2018Student\nSponsorships.\u2019\u201d (Id. \u00b6 626.) And, like Sanabil, Subul Al-\nKhair \u201cpaid small amounts individually in a manner of\nan old-style political machine, buying loyalty in\nperiodic stipends of $30-40 per quarter.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 627.)\nSubul Al-Khair, however, is not alleged to have\nengaged in violent acts on its own or in conjunction\nwith Hamas. \n\nApp. 64\nC. Union of Good \nThe Union of Good was established in 2000 \u201cas the\numbrella organization for Hamas\u2019 global fundraising\nactivity.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 629.) The Union of Good maintained an\naccount with BLOM in Beirut. (Id. \u00b6 640.) Plaintiffs do\nnot specify which, if any, transactions BLOM processed\non behalf of the Union of Good. Nor do Plaintiffs\nprovide dates for when BLOM maintained the stated\naccount on behalf of the Union of Good. \n1. Union of Good\u2019s Connection to Hamas\nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM knew of a nexus\nbetween the Union of Good and Hamas, but again rely\non public statements to support this inference,\nincluding: \n\u2022\nThat Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi \u2013 the\nindividual \nwho \nchaired \nthe \n101-day\nfundraising drive for emergency aid at the\noutset of the Second Intifada, which\nultimately developed into the Union of Good\n\u2013 made statements approving of terrorism,\nonly one of which (made on April 14, 2002)\nalso referenced Hamas, but not in a manner\nlinking it to the Union of Good (id. \u00b6\u00b6 631-32,\n637); \n\u2022\nThat \u201cHamas often relies on al-Qaradawi\u2019s\nlegal rulings in matters of current import\nand often turns to him to obtain legal\nrulings\u201d (id. \u00b6 638); \n\nApp. 65\n\u2022\nThat \u201cHamas leaders have . . . served openly\nin the Union of Good\u2019s executive leadership\u201d\n(id. \u00b6 639); and \n\u2022\nThe November 12, 2008 designation of the\nUnion of Good as an SDGT by the U.S.\nTreasury Department for its connections to\nHamas (id. \u00b6 635). \nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM was aware of these\nfacts.6\n2. Union of Good\u2019s Connection to Hamas\u2019\nViolent Acts \nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM knew of a nexus\nbetween the Union of Good and Hamas\u2019 violent acts,\nnor do they allege that Union of Good engaged in any\nviolent activities alone or in conjunction with Hamas.\nII.\nThe Instant Action \nOn January 1, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a complaint\nagainst BLOM for allegedly aiding and abetting\nHamas\u2019 attacks under the civil liability provisions of\nthe ATA, as amended by JASTA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d).\nAs explained above, Plaintiffs do not argue that BLOM\nis liable because it directly provided Hamas with\nfunding or weaponry. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that\nBLOM\u2019s Three Customers are, in sum and substance,\n6 Plaintiffs cite Israel\u2019s February 25, 2002 designation of the Union\nof Good due to its reported affiliation with Hamas. (Id. \u00b6 634.) Yet,\nPlaintiffs do not allege that BLOM maintains any branch in Israel\nor would have any other reason to know of the Israeli designation\nof the Union of Good.\n\nApp. 66\nalter egos of Hamas and, therefore, that BLOM\u2019s\nprovision of financial services to its Three Customers\namounted to aiding and abetting Hamas\u2019 terrorist acts\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d). \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM sought leave to move to\ndismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted. (ECF No. 20, Letter\nMotion for Pre-Motion Conference.) At a pre-motion\nconference addressing BLOM\u2019s proposed motion, the\nCourt offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their\ncomplaint to add additional allegations in response to\nBLOM\u2019s arguments. (ECF Dkt. Entry May 15, 2019.)\nPlaintiffs declined the Court\u2019s offer and represented to\nthe Court that they would not be seeking to amend\ntheir Complaint. (Id.) After the parties submitted their\nmemoranda, on November 25, 2019, the Court heard\noral argument on Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. (ECF\nDkt. Entry, Nov. 25, 2019. For the reasons set forth\nbelow, BLOM\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted. \nStandard of Review \nTo survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a\ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter to\n\u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). The\nplaintiff must show \u201cmore than a sheer possibility that\na defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Rather, the plaintiff must\nplead facts that allow the court to \u201cto draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the\nmisconduct alleged.\u201d Id. The factual allegations pled\n\nApp. 67\nmust \u201cbe enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level.\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nIn reviewing a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the\nCourt considers whether the plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded\nfactual allegations, assumed to be true, and drawing all\nreasonable inferences in the non-movant\u2019s favor,\n\u201cplausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d Iqbal,\n556 U.S. at 679. But the Court is \u201c\u2018not bound to accept\nas true a legal conclusion couched as a factual\nallegation.\u2019\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (quoting\nPapasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)). Thus, a\npleading that offers \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of\naction\u201d is not sufficient. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \u201cNor\ndoes a complaint suffice if it tenders \u2018naked\nassertion[s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual development.\u2019\u201d\nId. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 (alteration in\noriginal)). \nDiscussion \nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against BLOM arise under the\nATA. \u201cThe ATA establishes a cause of action for U.S.\nnationals who are the victims of international\nterrorism.\u201d Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, 405 F.\nSupp. 3d 525, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). \u201cFor purposes of\nand according to the ATA, \u2018international terrorism\u2019\nincludes \u2018activities that (A) involve violent acts or acts\ndangerous to human life that . . . would be a criminal\nviolation if committed within the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States or of any State\u2019 and that \u2018(B) appear to be\nintended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian\npopulation; (ii) to influence the policy of a government\nby intimidation; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a\n\nApp. 68\ngovernment by mass destruction, assassination, or\nkidnapping.\u2019\u201d Siegel v. HSBC N. Am. Holdings, Inc.,\n933 F.3d 217, 222 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2331(1)(A)\u2013(B)). \n\u201cIn its original form, the ATA afforded relief only\nagainst the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks, not\nagainst secondary, supporting actors.\u201d Id. (citing Linde\nv. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d 314, 319 (2d Cir. 2018)).\nIn 2016, however, Congress amended the ATA through\nJASTA to provide for secondary liability against \u201cany\nperson who aids and abets, by knowingly providing\nsubstantial assistance [to], or who conspires with the\nperson who committed[,] such an act of international\nterrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2333(d)(2). This aiding-and-\nabetting provision forms the basis of BLOM\u2019s alleged\nliability. \nCongress instructed courts to assess aiding-and-\nabetting liability under JASTA pursuant to Halberstam\nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Linde, 882 F.3d\nat 329. Halberstam prescribes that civil aiding and\nabetting is comprised of three elements: (1) \u201cthe party\nwhom the defendant aids must perform a wrongful act\nthat causes an injury,\u201d (2) \u201cthe defendant must be\ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal\nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the\nassistance,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe defendant must knowingly and\nsubstantially assist the principal violation.\u201d Id. (citing\nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 487). \nI.\nThe Halberstam Framework \nBLOM argues that Plaintiffs have not satisfied\nHalberstam because they do not plausibly allege\n\nApp. 69\n(1) that BLOM aided the persons or entity who carried\nout the attacks, (2) that BLOM was \u201cgenerally aware\u201d\nthat by providing financial services to the Three\nCustomers, it was thereby playing a role in Hamas\u2019\nviolent or life-endangering activities, or (3) that BLOM\nknowingly provided substantial assistance to Hamas.7\nThe Court agrees that Plaintiffs have failed plausibly\nto allege the general awareness and substantial\nassistance prongs. \nA. \u201cAiding Party Who Causes Injury\u201d\nElement \nThe first element Plaintiffs must plausibly allege is\nthat \u201cthe party . . . whom [BLOM] aid[ed] . . .\nperform[ed] a wrongful act that cause[d] an injury.\u201d Id.\nBLOM argues that JASTA applies only to the provision\nof direct support to terrorist organizations. See, e.g.,\nCrosby v. Twitter, Inc., 921 F.3d 617, 626-27 (6th Cir.\n2019). In BLOM\u2019s view, because the Three Customers\nare distinct from Hamas, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy this\nelement of Halberstam without establishing that\nBLOM either provided funding directly to Hamas or to\nthe individuals who carried out the attacks. \nThe Second Circuit recently considered whether\naiding-and-abetting liability under JASTA is limited to\nthe direct provision of support to a terrorist\norganization. Siegel, 933 F.3d at 223. The panel stated\n7 Defendant alternatively moves to dismiss certain individual\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims. (Def. Br. at 25-27.) Because the Court grants\nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in its entirety,\nit need not address whether these plaintiffs\u2019 claims should also be\ndismissed on other grounds.\n\nApp. 70\nin a footnote that \u201c[JASTA] does not, by its terms, limit\naiding-and-abetting liability to those who provide\ndirect support to terrorist organizations, and Congress\nwrote that its purpose in enacting the statute was \u2018to\nprovide civil litigants with the broadest possible basis\u2019\nto seek relief against those who \u2018have provided material\nsupport, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations\nor persons that engage in terrorist activities against\nthe United States.\u2019\u201d Id. at 223 n.5 (emphasis in\noriginal). This dicta suggests a healthy skepticism on\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s part as to whether JASTA liability\nis as limited as BLOM asserts. \nThe Court need not answer this question, however,\nbecause Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails on other grounds. As\nin Siegel, Plaintiffs have \u201cfailed to allege adequately\ntwo of the three Halberstam elements of civil aiding-\nand-abetting: (1) that [BLOM] was \u2018generally aware\u2019 of\nits role as part of an \u2018overall illegal or tortious activity\nat the time that [it] provide[d] the assistance,\u2019 and\n(2) that [BLOM] \u2018knowingly and substantially\nassist[ed] the principal violation.\u201d Id. at 224 (quoting\nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477). The Court thus leaves to\na later date the resolution of the question regarding the\nnecessity of direct support. \nB. \u201cGeneral Awareness\u201d Element \nThe second element Plaintiffs must plausibly allege\nis that \u201c[BLOM] was \u2018aware that, by assisting the\nprincipal, it [was] itself assuming a role in terrorist\nactivities.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Linde, 882 F.3d at 329). Plaintiffs\nmust allege that BLOM must have known it was\nassuming a role in Hamas\u2019 terrorist activities \u201cat the\n\nApp. 71\ntime that [it] provide[d] the assistance.\u201d Linde, 883\nF.3d at 329 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487). \nThe Second Circuit has clarified that the mere\nprovision of routine banking services to an FTO does\nnot render a bank liable for civil aiding and abetting.\nLinde, 882 F.3d at 329. \u201cEvidence that [a bank]\nknowingly provided banking services to [an FTO],\nwithout more, is insufficient to satisfy JASTA\u2019s scienter\nrequirement.\u201d Weiss v. National Westminster Bank\nPLC, 381 F. Supp. 3d 223, 239 (E.D.N.Y. 2019). This is\nbecause \u201caiding and abetting an act of international\nterrorism requires more than the provision of material\nsupport to a designated terrorist organization.\u201d Linde,\n882 F.3d at 329 (emphasis in original). \nRather, the bank must be \u201c\u2018aware\u2019 that, by assisting\nthe principal, it is itself assuming a \u2018role\u2019 in terrorist\nactivities.\u201d Id. (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 477).\n\u201cSuch awareness may not require proof of . . . specific\nintent\u201d or knowledge \u201cof the specific attacks at issue.\u201d\nId. But \u201cit does require that \u2018the bank was generally\naware that[, by providing financial services to a client,]\nit was thereby playing a \u2018role\u2019 in [the] violent or life-\nendangering activities.\u2019\u201d Siegel, 933 F.3d at 224\n(quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 329 (alterations in\noriginal)). This is a higher mens rea than that sufficient\nto establish material support in violation of the ATA,\n\u201cwhich requires only knowledge of the organization\u2019s\nconnection to terrorism, not intent to further its\nterrorist activities or awareness that one is playing a\nrole in those activities.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at 329-30. \nIn light of this precedent, it is not enough for\nPlaintiffs to \u201cplausibl[y] allege that BLOM was\n\nApp. 72\n\u2018generally aware of [its] role\u2019 in \u2018terrorist activities,\u2019\nfrom which terrorist attacks were a natural and\nforeseeable consequence.\u201d (ECF No. 37, Pls.\u2019 Opp. to\nMot. to Dismiss (\u201cPls. Opp.\u201d), at 11.) Adopting this\nreading would, in effect, replace the scienter for aiding-\nand-abetting liability with the lower scienter required\nfor material support, in direct contravention of Linde\u2019s\nholding that the bank must be aware that it is\nassuming a role in the organization\u2019s \u201cviolent or life-\nendangering activities.\u201d See Siegel, 933 F.3d at 224\n(citing Linde, 882 F.3d at 329). Attempts to conflate\nthese scienter requirements have been rejected by\ncourts within this circuit. See, e.g., Weiss, 381 F. Supp.\n3d at 238-39 (\u201cPlaintiffs again rely on evidence that\ntends to support a finding that Defendant had the\nrequisite scienter required for providing material\nsupport to a terrorist organization under \u00a7 2339B to\nsupport their claim that Defendant had the requisite\nscienter for aiding and abetting liability under JASTA.\nSee, Opp. at 24-25 (discussing Defendant\u2019s \u2018massive,\nillicit funds transfers\u2019 for Interpal and the Union of\nGood). However, as discussed in detail above, Plaintiffs\nallege no facts establishing a jury question as to\nwhether Defendant generally was aware that it played\na role in any of Hamas\u2019s, or even Interpal\u2019s, or the\nUnion of Good\u2019s violent or life-endangering activities.\nEvidence that Defendant knowingly provided banking\nservices to a terrorist organization, without more, is\ninsufficient to satisfy JASTA\u2019s scienter requirement.\u201d);\nStrauss v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., 379 F. Supp. 3d 148,\n164 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (same); Siegel, 2018 WL 3611967,\nat *4 (finding claim insufficient where defendant bank\n\nApp. 73\nallegedly aided and abetted another bank, which was\nknown to support terrorism).8 \nWith this guidance in mind, the Court considers\nwhether Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that, by\nproviding financial services to the Three Customers,\nBLOM generally assumed a role in Hamas\u2019 violent or\nlife-endangering activities. The answer is no. As in\nSiegel, Plaintiffs have \u201cfailed to [plausibly] allege\n[1] that [BLOM] was aware that by providing banking\nservices to [the Three Customers], it was supporting\n[Hamas], [2] much less assuming a role in [Hamas\u2019]\nviolent activities.\u201d See Siegel, 933 F.3d at 224. \nFirst, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not plausibly allege\nthat BLOM was generally aware of any connection\nbetween the Three Customers and Hamas. In their\ncomplaint, Plaintiffs do not allege any acts or\nstatements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees which\nsuggest any awareness on its part of a connection\nbetween any of the Three Customers and Hamas.\nInstead, Plaintiffs cite to press articles, government\n8 Plaintiffs quote a passage from Halberstam stating that the\ndistrict court\u2019s conclusions that Hamilton \u201cknew about and acted\nto support Welch\u2019s illicit enterprise,\u201d if not the murder, establish\nthat she \u201chad a general awareness of her role in a continuing\ncriminal enterprise.\u201d (Pls. Br. at 10 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d\nat 488 (emphasis added)).) Plaintiffs argue that this standard\nsimply requires Plaintiffs to show that BLOM knew that it was\nplaying a role, in a sense, in Hamas\u2019 terrorist enterprise, by\nproviding funds to organizations which supported Hamas. Again,\nthe standard Plaintiffs seek to impose is simply that of knowingly\nproviding material support to a terrorist organization, which\ndiffers from the scienter required to support aiding-and-abetting\nliability for supporting terrorist acts. \n\nApp. 74\nactions, and allegedly \u201cpublic knowledge\u201d discussing a\nconnection between the Three Customers and Hamas\nas evidence from which a jury could infer that BLOM\nmight have known of such a nexus. Yet, Plaintiffs fail\nplausibly to allege that BLOM or any of its employees\nactually knew or should have known of any of the cited\nsources, or that BLOM would otherwise have a reason\nto review or consider those sources in the course of its\noperations. This is particularly notable given that all of\nthe sources cited regarding the Three Customers and\ntheir connection to Hamas are either undated or were\ndated after the last of the attacks. The sole exception \u2013\na single payment processed from Al-Aqsa, a non-\ncustomer, to Sanabil one day after Al-Aqsa\u2019s\ndesignation by the U.S. Treasury Department \u2013 is not\nsufficient to render Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation plausible,\nparticularly given that Sanabil itself was not\ndesignated until several months later. Furthermore,\nduring the period in question, none of the Three\nCustomers was itself designated during the time\nBLOM processed transactions on its behalf, see, e.g.,\nO\u2019Sullivan v. Deutsche Bank AG et al., No. 17-cv-8709,\n2019 WL 1409446 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2019) (finding\nthat designation of entities years after defendants\ntransacted with them \u201cundermin[ed] any inference that\n[d]efendants had reason to know about [their]\nconnections with FTOs\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations\ntherefore fail to raise above the speculative level the\nspecter that BLOM was aware of a connection between\n\nApp. 75\nthe Three Customers and Hamas at the time it\nprovided financial services to the Three Customers.9\nSecond, even if Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations plausibly\nalleged that BLOM knew the Three Customers were\nrelated to Hamas, \u201c[e]vidence that [BLOM] knowingly\nprovided banking services to [Hamas], without more, is\ninsufficient to satisfy JASTA\u2019s scienter requirement.\u201d\nStrauss, 379 F. Supp. 3d at 164; accord Linde, 882 F.3d\nat 329; Weiss, 381 F. Supp. at 239. Rather, Plaintiffs\nmust plausibly allege that BLOM intended to further\nHamas\u2019 violent or life-endangering activities or was\ngenerally aware that it was playing a role in those\nactivities. Linde, 882 F.3d at 329-30; O\u2019Sullivan, 2019\nWL 1409446, at *10 (noting that to satisfy the second\nHalberstam element in this context, plaintiffs must\nallege that \u201cin providing financial services, [the bank]\nw[as] \u2018generally aware\u2019 [it] w[as] paying a \u2018role\u2019 in an\nFTO\u2019s violent or life-endangering activities\u201d). \nPlaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that BLOM\nknew that by providing financial services to the Three\nCustomers, it was playing a role in Hamas\u2019 violent\nactivities. The complaint does not allege that the Three\nCustomers engaged in any \u201cviolent activities.\u201d To the\n9 Plaintiffs also rely substantially on alleged transfers from HLF,\nKindHearts, and Al-Aqsa to the Three Customers to support the\ngeneral awareness element. But none of these organizations are\nalleged to be customers of BLOM, nor was there any evidence, as\nin Strauss and Weiss, that any of these transfers \u201cwere used to\nperpetrate any of the [violent acts]\u201d allegedly carried out by\nHamas. Without further factual enhancement, Plaintiffs\u2019 citations\nto these transactions does nothing more than speculate as to\nwhether BLOM might have known of this nexus. \n\nApp. 76\ncontrary, the complaint sets forth a number of\napparently charitable purposes towards which the\nThree Customers put their funds, including giving\nmoney to orphans, students, and the needy. See, e.g.,\nWeiss, 381 F. Supp. 3d at 232 (finding it relevant that\nplaintiffs conceded that recipients of funds actually\nengaged in charitable activities); Strauss, 379 F. Supp.\n3d at 157 (same). This is evidenced by an invoice\nannexed to the complaint, which notes that the\ntransaction was to be used for \u201chelp concerning orphan\nchildren.\u201d (Compl. Ex. D.) Even accepting as true that\nthe Three Customers did so to procure political support\nfor Hamas in the refugee camps, this does not cure the\nabsence of any plausible allegation that BLOM was\naware it was assuming a role in Hamas\u2019 violent or life-\nendangering activities. See, e.g., O\u2019Sullivan, 2019 WL\n1409446, at *10; Siegel v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., No.\n17-cv-6593, 2018 WL 3611967 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2018)\n(\u201cAccepting those statements as true, however, the\n[complaint] does not demonstrate that defendants\nknew that the financial services they provided to ARB\nwould in turn be given to AQI and al-Qaeda to carry\nout terrorist attacks . . . .\u201d). \nPlaintiffs attempt to analogize their case to those in\nwhich courts have allowed aiding-and-abetting claims\nagainst banks to proceed. They cite Miller v. Arab\nBank, PLC, 372 F. Supp. 3d 33 (E.D.N.Y. 2019), in\nwhich the court allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with\nan aiding-and-abetting claim against Arab Bank where\nthe plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank intentionally\n\u201cadministered a terrorist insurance scheme\u201d for\nHamas, quoted public notices directing individuals to\nproceed to Arab Bank to receive payouts pursuant to\n\nApp. 77\nthe alleged scheme, and cited causes of death identified\non lists that the bank received as part of the alleged\nscheme. Plaintiffs also cite Lelchook v. Islamic Republic\nof Iran, 393 F. Supp. 3d 261 (E.D.N.Y. 2019), in which\nthe court entered default judgment against an\nunrepresented defendant where the court found that\nthe allegations in the unanswered complaint plausibly\nsupported the allegation that the defendant bank\nknowingly and substantially supported Hizbollah\u2019s\noperations. \nA more appropriate comparison is Judge Daniels\u2019\nrecent decision in Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank,\nSAL. In Kaplan, plaintiffs sued Lebanese Canadian\nBank (\u201cLCB\u201d) for aiding and abetting Hizbollah by\nmaintaining accounts for two Hizbollah leaders and\nthree \u201csubordinate entities.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 529.\nThe subordinate entities allegedly functioned as\nHizbollah\u2019s principal financial institutions or provided\ndirect support to Hizbollah terrorists wounded in\naction.10 Id. The plaintiffs alleged that Hizbollah\n\u201cconducted wire transfers through the LCB [a]ccounts\n\u2018in order to transfer and receive funds necessary for\nplanning, preparing and carrying out Hizbollah\u2019s\nterrorist activity,\u2019 including the rocket attacks that\n10 \u201c[T]hese \u2018subordinate entities\u2019 include the Shahid (Martyrs)\nFoundation (\u2018Shahid\u2019), which allegedly provides \u2018financial and\nother material support to Hizbollah terrorists wounded in action,\nand to the families of Hizbollah terrorists killed in action\u2019; Bayt al-\nMal, which allegedly functions as Hizbollah\u2019s \u2018main financial body\u2019;\nand the Yousser Company for Finance and Investment . . . , which,\ntogether with Bayt al-Mal, allegedly functions as Hizbollah\u2019s\n\u2018unofficial treasury.\u2019\u201d Kaplan, 405 F. Supp. 3d, at 529. \n\nApp. 78\ninjured Plaintiffs.\u201d Id. To satisfy the awareness\nelement, the plaintiffs alleged that: \n[LCB] knew or should have known that\nproviding such banking services would result in\nPlaintiffs\u2019 injuries. [T]hey allege[d] that [LCB]\nknew that Shahid, Bayt-al-Mal, and Yousser\nwere \u2018integral constituent parts of Hizbollah,\u2019\nthat the LCB Accounts and funds therein were\nowned and controlled by Hizbollah, and that the\nwire transfers were conducted by and at the\ndirection of Hizbollah. Plaintiffs allege that\n[LCB] had such knowledge because Hizbollah\u2019s\naffiliation with Shahid, Bayt-al-Mal, and\nYousser was \u2018notorious public knowledge,\u2019 as\nevidenced by various news articles, reports, and\nHizbollah\u2019s own media sources. According to\nPlaintiffs, if [LCB] did not have such actual\nknowledge, then [LCB] should have known\nbecause it had a duty to perform due diligence\non its customers, monitor and report suspicious\nor illegal banking activities, and not provide\nbanking services to [FTOs]. \nId. The plaintiffs further alleged that \u201c[LCB] provided\nthe wire transfer and other banking services to\nHizbollah \u2018as a matter of official LCB policy and\npractice\u2019 in order, among other things, \u2018to assist and\nadvance Hizbollah\u2019s terrorist activities.\u2019\u201d Id. \nJudge Daniels found the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations\ninsufficient to state a claim of aiding-and-abetting\nliability under the Halberstam framework. The\nplaintiffs \u201cd[id] not offer any non-conclusory allegations\nthat Defendant was aware that, by providing financial\n\nApp. 79\nservices to the subordinate entities, it was playing a\nrole in violent or life-threatening acts intended to\nintimate or coerce civilians or affect a government.\u201d Id.\nat 535. None of the entities were designated by the\nUnited States prior to the rocket attacks at issue as\nhaving an affiliation with Hizbollah. Id. Moreover,\nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019\nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas openly, publicly and\nrepeatedly acknowledged and publicized by Hizbollah\n[through its own sources]\u201d and \u201cin various English-\nlanguage publications,\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cnowhere\nallege[d] . . . that [LCB] read or was aware of such\nsources.\u201d Id. The same analysis applies even more\nstrongly here, given the relatively greater strength of\nthe allegations in Kaplan.11 \nC. \u201cSubstantial Assistance\u201d Element \nThe third element Plaintiffs must plausibly allege\nis that BLOM \u201c\u2018knowingly and substantially assist[ed]\nthe principal violation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 535-36 (quoting\nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477 (alterations in original)).\nTo determine whether Plaintiffs adequately pleaded\nthis element, the Court looks to \u201c(1) the nature of the\n11 The only fact in this action which presents an arguably stronger\nargument than in Kaplan is that BLOM processed a transaction\nfrom Al-Aqsa, a nonclient, to Sanabil, a client, after its designation.\nBut this transaction was not processed for a client, occurred just\none day after Al-Aqsa\u2019s designation, was received from a Swedish\nbank through New York, and specified assistance to orphans as its\npurpose. It is nothing more than speculation that this transaction\nwould trigger some awareness on BLOM\u2019s part that there was a\nnexus between Sanabil and Hamas, let alone Hamas\u2019 violent\nactivities. \n\nApp. 80\nact encouraged, (2) the amount of assistance given by\ndefendant, (3) defendant\u2019s presence or absence at the\ntime of the tort, (4) defendant\u2019s relation to the\nprincipal, (5) defendant\u2019s state of mind, and (6) the\nperiod of defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d Linde, 882 F.3d at\n329 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 483\u201384). The\ncomplaint fails to establish that BLOM\u2019s provision of\nfinancial services to the Three Customers amounted to\nproviding \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to Hamas. \nAs a threshold matter, Halberstam\u2019s substantial\nassistance element requires that BLOM\u2019s assistance be\nknowing. For the same reasons set forth above,\nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails plausibly to allege that any\nassistance BLOM provided \u2013 even if substantial \u2013\nwould have been knowing, as the allegations support\nnothing more than the speculative possibility that\nBLOM might have known about a nexus between the\nThree Customers and Hamas (though, as specified\nabove, no allegations whatsoever link the Three\nCustomers to Hamas\u2019 violent activities). The Court will\naddress scienter in the context of the substantial\nassistance element in more detail in discussing the six\nconsiderations outlined in Linde and Halberstam.\nNature of the Act Encouraged. Plaintiffs\u2019 harm\narises from violent acts conducted by Hamas, but\nPlaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that BLOM\nencouraged the attacks which injured Plaintiffs or\nknowingly provided any funds to Hamas for its violent\nactivities. See, e.g., Siegel, 933 F.3d at 225 (\u201cThe\nplaintiffs here have not plausibly alleged that HSBC\nencouraged the heinous November 9 Attacks or\nprovided any funds to AQI.\u201d); Kaplan, 405 F. Supp. 3d\n\nApp. 81\nat 536 (\u201cPlaintiffs do not advance any factual, non-\nconclusory allegations that Defendant knowingly and\nintentionally supported Hizbollah in perpetrating the\nrocket attacks.\u201d). Assuming arguendo that BLOM knew\nanything of the Three Customers\u2019 efforts to support\nHamas, it would be that they engaged in the purchase\nof political support, but none of the factual allegations\nin Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint suggest that BLOM knowingly\nencouraged Hamas\u2019 violent activities, such as those\nwhich caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. \nAmount and Kind of Assistance Given by\nDefendant. Plaintiffs allege that BLOM\u2019s provision of\nfinancial services to the Three Customers resulted in\n\u201cmillions of dollars\u201d flowing to Hamas which were\n\u201cintegral\u201d to Hamas\u2019 terrorist operations. But Plaintiffs\nmake no non-conclusory assertions that any of the\nfunds processed by the Three Customers actually went\nto Hamas, or that BLOM, at the time it provided\nbanking services to the Three Customers, was aware or\nintended that Hamas would receive the corresponding\nfunds. See, e.g., Siegel, 933 F.3d at 225 (\u201c[P]laintiffs did\nallege that HSBC provided hundreds of millions of\ndollars to ARB, but they did not advance any non-\nconclusory allegation that AQI received any of those\nfunds or that HSBC knew or intended that AQI would\nreceive the funds.\u201d); Kaplan, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 536\n(\u201c[A]lthough Plaintiffs assert that Defendant processed\nmillions of dollars\u2019 worth of wire transfers through the\nLCB Accounts, Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that\nHizbollah received any of those funds or that\nDefendant knew or intended that Hizbollah would\nreceive the funds.\u201d). Again, even assuming the Three\nCustomers did work to drum up political support for\n\nApp. 82\nHamas, there are no non-conclusory allegations that\nBLOM\u2019s assistance to the Three Customers went\ntowards Hamas\u2019 violent activities. \nDefendant\u2019s Presence or Absence at the Time of the\nActs. BLOM was not physically present during the\nattacks. Even if the term \u201cpresence\u201d could be broadly\ninterpreted, Siegel, 933 F.3d at 225 (\u201c[A]s the plaintiffs\nthemselves allege, HSBC was not \u2018present\u2019 at the time\nof the November 9 Attacks. Indeed, HSBC had ceased\ntransacting any business with ARB ten months prior.\u201d\n(emphasis added)), BLOM was not \u201cpresent\u201d during the\ntime of the attacks, other than providing banking\nservices to Sanabil and Subul Al-Khair during the\nrelevant period. (Plaintiffs make no allegations as to\nwhen the Union of Good maintained an account at\nBLOM.) \nDefendant\u2019s Relation to the Principal. Plaintiffs\nmake no non-conclusory allegations that BLOM had\nany relationship with Hamas. See, e.g., id. (\u201cOn the\nfourth factor \u2014 defendant\u2019s relation to the principal \u2014\nthe plaintiffs do not plead any non-conclusory\nallegations that HSBC had any relationship with\nAQI.\u201d). \nDefendant\u2019s State of Mind. Plaintiffs make no non-\nconclusory allegations that BLOM knowingly assumed\na role in Hamas\u2019 terrorist activities or otherwise\nknowingly or intentionally supported Hamas. See, e.g.,\nid. (\u201c[O]n the fifth factor \u2014 defendant\u2019s state of mind \u2014\nthe plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that HSBC\nknowingly assumed a role in AQI\u2019s terrorist activities\nor otherwise knowingly or intentionally supported\nAQI.\u201d). \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \ncitation \nto \nallegedly \npublic\n\nApp. 83\nknowledge, without any plausible allegations tying the\ncited public knowledge to BLOM, is not sufficient to\nshow that BLOM had a culpable state of mind. \nPeriod of Defendant\u2019s Assistance. Plaintiffs do not\nallege the full duration of BLOM\u2019s relationship(s) with\nthe Three Customers. Plaintiffs allege that BLOM\nprovided Sanabil and Subul Al-Khair with financial\nservices for the duration of the relevant period but\nmake no plausible allegation that any of the funds\nprovided to the Three Customers during this period\nwent to support Hamas\u2019 violent activities. See, e.g., id.\n(\u201c[P]laintiffs do not allege \u2014 even conclusorily \u2014 that\nmost, or even many, of HSBC\u2019s services to ARB\nassisted terrorism.\u201d). \nPlaintiffs again rely on cases addressing liability for\nthe provision of material support to terrorist groups in\narguing that their allegations are sufficient to\nwithstand a motion to dismiss. They cite, for example,\nBoim v. Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev., 549 F.3d\n685, 698 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding that the provision of\nsupport \nto \na \nterrorist \norganization, \neven \nif\n\u201cearmark[ed] . . . for the organization\u2019s non-terrorist\nactivities[,] does not get [a defendant] off the liability\nhook\u201d because such activities \u201creinforce [an FTO\u2019s]\nterrorist activities\u201d), and Gill v. Arab Bank, PLC, 893\nF. Supp. 2d 474, 507 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cA contribution,\nif not used directly, arguably would be used indirectly\nby substituting it for money in Hamas\u2019 treasury; money\ntransferred by Hamas\u2019 political wing in place of the\ndonation could be used to buy bullets.\u201d). As addressed\nabove, however, Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on this line of cases\nis misplaced. Liability for providing material support to\n\nApp. 84\nan FTO turns on a different, less onerous scienter\nrequirement than aiding and abetting a terrorist act.\nKaplan again provides a more appropriate point of\nreference. There, as here, the plaintiffs \u201cd[id] not\nadvance any factual, non-conclusory allegations that\n[LCB] knowingly and intentionally supported Hizbollah\nin perpetrating [its violent activities, i.e., rocket\nattacks].\u201d Kaplan, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 536. \u201c[A]lthough\nPlaintiffs assert[ed] that [LCB] processed millions of\ndollars\u2019 worth of wire transfers through the LCB\nAccounts, [they] d[id] not plausibly allege that\nHizbollah received any of those funds or that [LCB]\nknew or intended that Hizbollah would receive the\nfunds.\u201d Id. \u201cNor d[id] Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that\n[LCB] knew, prior to the attacks, about any affiliations\nbetween Hizbollah and the [subordinate entities] under\nwhose names the LCB Accounts were held.\u201d12 Id. So too\nhere. \nII.\nLeave to Amend \nPursuant to Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, courts should \u201cfreely give leave [to\namend a complaint] when justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.\n12 Judge Daniels also rejected an argument, not made here, that\nLCB processed the payments pursuant to its longstanding policy\nof supporting Hizbollah. Kaplan, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 536. The\nplaintiffs\u2019 only evidence of this fact was the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nFebruary 2011 designation of LCB as a \u201cprimary money\nlaundering concern\u201d and limited allegations from a December 2011\ncomplaint filed against LCB, which Judge Daniels found\ninsufficient to support plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that LCB supported\nHizbollah\u2019s agenda or that LCB provided funds to the subordinate\nentities to support this agenda. Id.\n\nApp. 85\nCiv. P. 15(a)(2). Whether to grant leave is a matter\n\u201cwithin the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d\nMcCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 200\n(2d Cir. 2007). In line with this authority, the Court\ntypically grants plaintiffs an opportunity to amend\ntheir complaints following dismissal, to address any\ndeficiencies raised by the Court\u2019s order. Plaintiffs here\ndo not request leave to amend, and specifically declined\nthe Court\u2019s offer to do so at the pre-motion conference.\nThe Court addresses amendment of the complaint\nbecause BLOM asks that dismissal be with prejudice.\n(Def. Br. at 27.) \nThe Second Circuit has clarified that a district court\nmay dismiss a complaint without providing for an\namendment where, as here, the plaintiffs previously\ndeclined an opportunity to amend their complaint: \nThe district court gave plaintiffs-appellants the\nopportunity to amend the Complaint after a pre-\nmotion \ntelephone \nconference \nwhere \nthe\ndefendants described their arguments in favor of\ndismissal. Plaintiffs-appellants declined to do so.\nThereafter, plaintiffs-appellants did not move to\namend the Complaint after the defendants filed\ntheir briefs in support of dismissal. Although\nplaintiffs-appellants informally requested leave\nto amend in their motion papers, they did not\nsubmit proposed amendments or otherwise\nindicate how they would correct any deficiencies\nin the Complaint. Under these circumstances, it\nwas within the district court\u2019s discretion to\ndismiss the Complaint with prejudice. \n\nApp. 86\nRosner v. Star Gas Partners, L.P., 344 F. App\u2019x 642,\n645 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order); see also Berman v.\nMorgan Keegan & Co., 455 F. App\u2019x 92, 97 (2d Cir.\n2012) (summary order) (stating that \u201ca district court\ndoes not abuse its discretion to deny a plaintiff\u2019s motion\nto alter or amend a judgment\u201d where \u201cthe court\nexpressly invited plaintiffs to amend the Complaint,\nbut plaintiffs declined the court\u2019s invitation\u201d). \nCourts in the Second Circuit routinely dismiss\ncomplaints without leave under similar circumstances.\nSee, e.g., Herman v. Town of Cortlandt, Inc., No. 18-CV-\n2440 (CS), 2019 WL 2327565, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 30,\n2019) (granting motion to dismiss without leave to\namend because \u201cPlaintiffs did not amend, despite\nhaving been given leave to do so after receiving the\nbenefit of a pre-motion letter from Defendants, as well\nas the Court\u2019s observations during a pre-motion\nconference\u201d); Berman v. Morgan Keegan & Co., No. 10-\ncv-5866(PKC), 2011 WL 2419886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 3, 2011), aff\u2019d, 455 F. App\u2019x 92; Williams v. Time\nWarner Inc., No. 09-cv-2962(RJS), 2010 WL 846970, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2010), aff\u2019d, 440 F. App\u2019x 7 (2d Cir.\n2011). \nIn light of Plaintiffs\u2019 rejection of the opportunity to\namend their pleading at the pre-motion conference, and\nthe fact that they have not identified any additional\nfacts they could allege which would address the\ndeficiencies in their complaint, the Court finds that it\nneed not grant Plaintiffs leave to amend. The\ncomplaint will therefore be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nApp. 87\nConclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that\nPlaintiffs have failed to plausibly state a claim that\nDefendant aided and abetting Hamas\u2019s terrorist acts,\nsuch as those which caused their injuries, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d). Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails\nplausibly to allege (1) that Defendant was generally\naware that, by providing financial services to the Three\nCustomers, it was thereby playing a \u201crole\u201d in Hamas\u2019\nterrorist activities, and (2) that Defendant knowingly\nprovided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to Hamas by\nproviding financial services to the Three Customers. In\nlight of this holding, the Court need not reach\nDefendant\u2019s \nalternative \nargument \nthat \ncertain\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims require dismissal for jurisdictional or\nother reasons. \nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\nwith prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted is therefore\nGRANTED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed\nto enter judgment in favor of Defendant and to close\nthis case. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:\nJanuary 14, 2020 \nBrooklyn, New York \n/s/                                          \nHon.

MATSUMOTO\u2019s chambers.) \nTHE COURT: Hello. Good afternoon, this is Judge\nMatsumoto. The case is Honickman, et al versus Blom\nBank, 19-Civil-008. \nWho is on for the plaintiff, please? \nMR. OSEN: Good afternoon, Your Honor. \nGary Osen, Osen LLC, for the plaintiff. With me on\nmy end is my partner Ari Ungar, and also joining is\nSteve Steingard from Kohn, Swift & Graf. \nTHE COURT: All right. \nWell, who is going to be speaking for the plaintiffs\ntoday? \nMR. OSEN: I will be, Your Honor, Gary Osen. \nTHE COURT: Okay, thank you. Please just make\nsure you identify yourself before you speak during this\ncall because we have a court reporter and she and I\nboth need to be able to identify who is speaking. \nWho is representing the defendants, please? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Good afternoon, Your Honor.\nThis is Linda Goldstein from Dechert. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: With me on the line are my\npartner Michael McGinley, and my colleagues, Selby\nBrown and Justin Romeo, and I will be doing the\nspeaking. \n\nApp. 91\nTHE COURT: Okay, very good. \n[p.4] \nThe other two names that you mentioned after Mr.\nMcGinley appear not to have entered a notice of\nappearance on this docket. So if you would ask them to\ndo so, if they will be involved in the litigation or may\nappear in the future, I would appreciate it. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Your Honor, will do.\nTHE COURT: All right, thank you. \nAll right, I scheduled the pre-motion conference\nbecause of the defense request to file a motion to\ndismiss the complaint. And even though the complaint\nis very lengthy, the defendants have pointed out a\nvariety of ways that it believes the complaint falls\nshort. \nI do have a question. The statute of limitations, as\nfar as we could tell, is ten years after the date the\ncause of action accrued. And as I read the complaint it\nappeared to me that many of these occurrences\noccurred in 2000 through 2001, \u20192 or \u20193. \nI am wondering if there is an issue regarding the\nstatute of limitations? \nWould Mr. Osen want to deal with that? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: I will let plaintiffs address that.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Goldstein? \nMR. OSEN: Your Honor --\n\nApp. 92\nTHE COURT: Wait. \nMs. Goldstein, did you say that you were going to \n[p.5] \nlet Mr. Osen address or did you want to? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, yes. \nTHE COURT: All right, go ahead, Mr. Osen. \nMR. OSEN: Thank you, Your Honor. \nYour assessment is correct. There is a ten-year\nstatute of limitations. The claims are outside the ten-\nyear timeframe. However, there is a savings clause\nthat was part of the enactment of the statutory\nextension in 2013. And so when Congress passed the\nextension, which was originally four years, and made\nit ten, they created a savings clause that extended it six\nyears from the date of enactment of that provision in\n2013. And that\u2019s why the plaintiffs contend the action\nis timely. \nTHE COURT: All right, so it is six years beyond the\nten years. So we have -- \nMR. OSEN: No, Your Honor. I\u2019m sorry, six years\nfrom the date of enactment of January 1, 2000 -- or, I\u2019m\nsorry, January 2nd, 2013. \nTHE COURT: All right. Okay, well, then let\u2019s talk\nabout scheduling the motion. \nMs. Goldstein, are you moving under 12(b)(6)? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. \n\nApp. 93\nTHE COURT: Okay. I am just wondering if it might\nbe prudent to allow the plaintiffs to amend their\ncomplaint, not to add more claims, not to add more\nparties, but rather to \n[p.6] \nfactually support some of the claims that you have\nidentified as being deficient regarding the standards\nthat were adopted by the Second Circuit from the D.C.\nCircuit. \nMr. Osen, do you want that opportunity? Because as\nyou probably well know, in the Second Circuit if I were\nto grant the 12(b)(6) motion generally, the Second\nCircuit would like the district courts to allow an\namendment unless it would be futile. \nAre there any additional facts you could add to the\nallegations that the defendant is challenging here or\nare you comfortable standing on your complaint as it\nis? \nI am not asking for more, obviously, because it is\nvery lengthy, but I just wanted to raise that. \nMR. OSEN: Sure. \nNo, I think we are prepared to brief it based on the\narguments presented in the pre-motion letter. \nTHE COURT: So you do not want an opportunity to\namend. So if I were to grant the defendant\u2019s motion,\nyou would not want to amend, is that correct? \nBecause I do not want to go through another round\nof motions. \n\nApp. 94\nMR. OSEN: Understood, Your Honor. And sitting\nhere today based on what was represented as the\narguments in the pre-motion letter, we would not seek\nleave to amend. \nTHE COURT: All right. Why don\u2019t we then just set\n[p.7] \nup a briefing schedule. \nI will adopt the proposed briefing schedule, if the\nparties would like me to do that, with the defendant\nmoving and serving June 3rd, 2019; and then the\nplaintiff serving its opposition papers July 8th; and\nreplies by defense, the defendant to be served on July\n29th. \nAnd at that point on July 29th is when the parties\nwould cooperate to upload their motions in modular\norder. \nDoes anybody want relief from this proposed\nschedule that was set forth in Ms. Goldstein\u2019s pre-\nmotion conference request letter? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: No, that schedule is fine with us,\nYour Honor. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMr. Osen, it\u2019s fine with you, too? \nMR. OSEN: Indeed; thank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \n\nApp. 95\nJust please remember that I do not want you to\nupload anything on the docket until the motion is fully\nbriefed on the 29th of July, and that you provide two\ncourtesy copies to me. All right? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Understood, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Mr. Osen, do you see any possibility\nthat you would voluntarily dismiss some of these\nclaims? \nMR. OSEN: No, Your Honor. \n[p.8] \nTHE COURT: All right. Because the other claim\nMs. Goldstein raises is regarding the requirement\nunder the ATA that the plaintiffs be nationals of the\nUnited States. And some of your plaintiffs, as you\nallege, are not. \nMR. OSEN: Right, I mean we would -- that\u2019s a fair\npoint, Your Honor. \nThe question -- we\u2019d have to look at that more\ngranularly because it really depends on whether the\ndecedent -- I\u2019m sorry, whether the non-U.S. national is\nsuing based on a death or an injury. At least, that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s the construction that Judge Cogan has given in\nthis district. \nSo to the extent that\u2019s raised, we\u2019d have to look at it\nindividually, but it\u2019s possible that certain of those\nclaims we might be willing to withdraw. \nTHE COURT: So are you going to wait until you\nreceive the defendant\u2019s papers, their submissions, or\n\nApp. 96\nare you going to talk about it and do some more\nresearch and figure out whether you want to spare\nthem the ink and the time to brief as to those\nplaintiffs? \nMR. OSEN: I think the latter, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMR. OSEN: To the extent, I have to confess, I\nhaven\u2019t focused on that issue in particular, but to the\nextent that that has been raised, we would -- I think\nour position would be we would look at that now on a\nplaintiff-by-plaintiff \n[p.9] \nbasis. Obviously, any claim that\u2019s dismissed, as we\ndiscussed earlier, there is no future recourse. So we\nwould look at that carefully now, but in the event that\nwe concur on any particular plaintiff, we would do that\nbefore the motion is briefed. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Could I ask that Your Honor set\na deadline for that? \nTHE COURT: Right, I will, because I mean,\nobviously, you cannot wait until it is briefed because\nshe is going to start drafting. And she has identified at\nparagraph four of her letter a number of plaintiffs who\nare nationals of Israel and France, and also identifies\nby paragraph those allegations where the complaint\ndoes not really allege that the injuries allegedly\nsuffered were proximately caused by the terrorism,\nalleged terrorism or the acts of the defendants. \n\nApp. 97\nSo you should look at all of this because if this is\nsomething that you would agree to or in your\noppositions you just say: Oh, well, we are not going to\ndispute that, it is not going to sit well with me that you\nforced the defendant to brief the issue. It really is up to\nyou, as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, to know your clients and to\ndo the correct thing with regard to whether they belong\nin the case or not. \nSo -- \nMR. OSEN: Your Honor, Gary Osen. \nTHE COURT: Yes, go ahead. \n[p.10] \nMR. OSEN: Sorry, Your Honor. \nNo, we fully agree with that and I think today is\nWednesday, I think if we can get back to the defendant\na week from Monday, I think that would be sufficient\ntime for us to respond. \nI will say, just by reference to the fact that the\npurported language that you just mentioned about a\nplaintiff who is a citizen of France, that\u2019s the kind of\nclaim we would not be dismissing because the victim is\nan American national and there is a deceased\nindividual. So it would be a more granular question.\nAnd I would just add, Your Honor, that the decision, I\nassume, that the defendant would be relying upon\ncame out after the actual complaint was filed. \nSo we will take a look at it. With Your Honor\u2019s\npermission, we would let the defendants know in about\n\nApp. 98\nten days\u2019 time, whatever that calendar date is, and\nthen they can decide. \nTHE COURT: No, I think I am going to ask you to\nmake a more rapid inquiry and response. Because we\nset June, or you proposed June 3rd as the date that the\npapers would be served and it is already May 15th. So\nI would ask you to let them know by May 22nd. All\nright? \nMR. OSEN: That\u2019s fine, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: So you are going to advise the\ndefendants by May 22nd which plaintiffs, if any, you\nwill \n[p.11] \nvoluntarily dismiss. Right? \nMR. OSEN: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor? \nTHE COURT: You are going to let the defense\nlawyer know that the ATA claims brought by certain of\nyour clients would be dismissed, correct? \nMR. OSEN: Correct. \nTHE COURT: All right. \nAll right, is there anything else I should address?\nNo? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Linda Goldstein, Your Honor.\nThat was all we had. \nTHE COURT: All right, anything else from you, Mr.\nOsen? \n\nApp. 99\nMR. OSEN: No, that\u2019s it, Your Honor. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: All right, thank you everybody. I will\nawait your fully briefed motion on July 29th. And\nplease deliver two courtesy copies of your motion\npapers to my chambers. All right? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. \nMR. OSEN: Understood. \nTHE COURT: Thank you very much. Have a good\nday. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, you too are, Your\nHonor. \nMR. OSEN: Take care. \nTHE COURT: All right, bye-bye. \n(Conference call concluded.) \n\nApp. 100\n                         \nAPPENDIX F\n                         \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n19 CV 0008(KAM)\n[Dated November 25, 2019]\n_________________________________\nMICHAEL HONICKMAN, et al,\n)\nPlaintiffs, \n)\n)\nversus \n)\n)\nBLOM BANK, \n)\nDefendant. \n)\n________________________________ )\nU.S. Courthouse \nBrooklyn, NY\nNovember 25, 2019 \n2:00 PM \nTRANSCRIPT OF CIVIL CAUSE FOR ORAL\nARGUMENT \nBEFORE THE HONORABLE KIYO MATSUMOTO\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nAPPEARANCES \nAttorneys for Plaintiff: \nOSEN, LLP \n2 University Place, Suite 402 \n\nApp. 101\nHackensack, New Jersey 07601 \nBY:\nMICHAEL RADINE, ESQ. \nGARY OSEN, ESQ. \nAttorneys for Defendant:\nDECHERT, LLP \nCira Center \n2929 Arch Street \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 \nBY:\nLINDA GOLDSTEIN, ESQ. \nJUSTIN ROMEO, ESQ. \nMICHAEL McGINLEY, ESQ. \nOfficial Court Reporter: \nLISA SCHMID, CCR, RMR \nEmail: LisaSchmidCCR.RMR@gmail.com \nProceedings recorded by mechanical stenography.\nTranscript produced by computer-aided transcription.\n[p.2] \nTHE CLERK: This is Civil Cause for Oral Argument\non defendant, BLOM Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. \nWill plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys please state your\nappearances, please? \nMR.

Thank you. Please have a\nseat. \nI think we\u2019ll hear from the defendants first, since\nthis is their motion. Would you like to be heard? \n[p.3] \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Your Honor. \nMay it please the Court, the plaintiffs in this case\nwere killed or injured by bombings and shootings in\nJerusalem, Tel Aviv, and in the West Bank between\nDecember 1, 2001, and August 19, 2003. Those attacks\nwere violent, life-threatening, and utterly despicable.\nThey were committed by HAMAS operatives. \n\nApp. 103\nBLOM Bank, the Lebanese bank that is the only\ndefendant in this case, is not alleged to have had any\nroles in those attacks, any connection to the HAMAS\noperatives or indeed, any direct connection to HAMAS\nitself. \nThe issue on this motion is whether plaintiffs\u2019\nallegations that BLOM Bank provided routine banking\nservices to three alleged customers that allegedly\nprovided financial support to HAMAS is enough to hold\nBLOM Bank liable for aiding and abetting a terrorist\nact under the Justice Against Sponsors to Terrorism\nAct, or JASTA. Under clear Second Circuit precedent,\nthe answer is plainly no. \nJASTA is a relatively new statute. It was enacted by\nCongress in 2016. The statute states, and I quote,\nliability may be asserted as to any person who aids and\nabets by knowingly providing substantial assistance or\nwho conspired with a person who committed such an\nact of international terrorism. \nThe term \u201cknowingly\u201d is a crucial mens rea \n[p.4] \nrequirement under the statute, as the Second Circuit\nhas underscored in two recent cases interpreting\nJASTA. \nIn Linde versus Arab Bank, the Second Circuit held\nthat plaintiffs have to allege facts plausibly showing\nthat BLOM Bank had, quote, a general awareness of its\nrole in violent or life-threatening activity. \n\nApp. 104\nThe Second Circuit held that aiding and abetting an\nact of international terrorism requires more than the\nprovision of material support to a designated terrorist\norganization. Aiding and abetting requires the\nsecondary actor to be quote, aware, closed quote, that\nby assisting the principal is itself assuming a, quote,\nrole, closed quote, in terrorist activities. \nSecond Circuit then considered whether it would be\nenough to make this required showing by alleging that\na bank had knowingly provided material support to a\nterrorist organization in the form of financial services,\nand the answer was a strong no. To go back to the\nwords of Linde again, quote, what the jury did have to\nfind was that in providing such services, the bank was\ngenerally aware that it was thereby playing a role in\nHAMAS\u2019 violent or life-threatening activities, closed\nquote. \nIn the Linde case, the Second Circuit identified\ncertain evidence from the trial record that could have\nsupported that finding. In that case, Arab Bank, the\n[p.5] \ndefendant, had a role in administering a terrorist\ninsurance scheme which made payments to the\nsurvivors of suicide bombers, where the documentation\nthat was submitted to Arab Bank made it clear those\nwere payments for martyrdom, and expressly stated\nthe violent manner in which the insureds had died.\nJust a few months ago in the Siegel case, the Second\nCircuit provided a second guidepost for the assessment\nof mens rea allegations against financial services\n\nApp. 105\ninstitutions that are accused of aiding and abetting\nterrorist acts. \nThere, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal\nof claims against HSBC Bank, which was alleged to\nhave done business with a Saudi bank called Al Rajhi\nBank. The complaint in that case alleged that Al Rajhi\nBank was involved in financing terrorist activity by\nal-Qaeda in Iraq, and that HSBC knew that Al Rajhi\nBank supported al-Qaeda in Iraq. \nThe complaint further alleged that HSBC was\ninvolved in stripping the identifying information from\ncertain financial transactions with Al Rajhi Bank to\nconceal those activities from U. S. regulators and law\nenforcement. \nAnd \nin \nfact, \nHSBC \nhad \nentered \ninto \na\nnon-prosecution agreement with the United States\ngovernment, in which it paid nearly two billion dollars\nin forfeitures and civil penalties for alleged money\nlaundering. \nWith respect to HSBC\u2019s mens rea, the Second\nCircuit \n[p.6] \nheld that the complaint did not plausibly allege that\nHSBC had assumed a role in the attacks at issue in\nthat case. To quote from that opinion, at most, the\nallegations, even when viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, assert that HSBC was aware\nthat Al Rajhi Bank was believed by some to have links\nto al-Qaeda in Iraq and other terrorist organizations,\nclosed quote. \n\nApp. 106\nThe Second Circuit held that that alleged\nknowledge was not enough to show that HSBC\nknowingly played a role in terrorist activities, in part\nbecause the complaint itself alleged that Al Rajhi was\na large bank and plaintiffs did not contend that most or\neven many of its transactions were connected to\nterrorism. \nThe Siegel decision also affirmed the dismissal of\nthe aiding and abetting claim against HSBC on the\nground that it had not adequately pleaded substantial\nassistance. There, the court held that there was no\nencouragement of terrorism, and that even though\nHSBC was accused of sending hundreds of millions of\ndollars to Al Rajhi Bank and had paid a massive\npenalty for alleged money laundering, there was -- and\nI\u2019m quoting again -- no non-conclusory allegation that\nal-Qaeda in Iraq received any of these funds or that\nHSBC knew or intended that al-Qaeda in Iraq would\nreceive those funds, closed quote. \nAgainst that legal background, I\u2019d like to turn to the\nallegations in this case. The only fact alleged against\n[p.7] \nBLOM are that it maintained accounts for three\nalleged customers: Sanabil, Subul Al-Khair and Union\nof Good. \nCrucially, there are no allegations in the complaint\nthat any of these three alleged customers themselves\nperpetrated terrorist acts. There\u2019s no allegation that\nany of these customers was itself involved in violence\nor life-threatening activity. \n\nApp. 107\nTHE COURT: But don\u2019t they allege that these three\ncustomers did provide funding for HAMAS-related\nactivities? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: They allege that -- well, the U. S.\ngovernment later found that both Sanabil and Union of\nGood were Specialized Designated Global Terrorists,\nwhich means that they provided support, financial\nsupport to HAMAS, but not for any terrorist activities\nspecifically, and certainly not the terrorist activities\nthat are at issue in this complaint, and that is the\ncrucial distinction that Linde draws: Providing\nmaterial support to a terrorist organization is not the\nsame as providing support to an act of terrorism. And\nthe aiding and abetting statute requires knowing and\nsubstantial participation in the act perpetrated by the\nprincipal actor, and that\u2019s what\u2019s missing here. \nAnd the complaint, in fact, contains numerous\nallegations that would be I guess completely\ninconsistent with the notion of any of these customers\nperpetrating terrorist acts themselves. \n[p.8] \nSanabil and Subul Al-Khair are explicitly described\nas charitable organizations and to the extent there is\nany description of their activities at all in the\ncomplaint, it\u2019s charitable acts. The allegation is that\nSanabil was created to compete with Hezbollah\u2019s social\nwelfare structure, that Sanabil provided basic\nnecessities in Palestinian refugee camps, that Sanabil\nspent money on orphans and needy patients, that it\nspent money in the old manner of an old style political\nmachine, and Subul Al-Khair -- I\u2019m sure I\u2019m mangling\n\nApp. 108\nthe pronunciation -- is alleged to have functioned much\nlike Sanabil. \nThe complaint also alleges that the Sanabil and\nSubul Al-Khair accounts at BLOM received funds from\nother charitable organizations, specifically, the Holy\nLand Foundation and Al-Aqsa. But critically, again,\nthese organizations are not alleged to have been\nengaged in violent or life-threatening activities either.\nTo the contrary, the two transfers from Al-Aqsa that\nare \nalleged \nin \nthe \ncomplaint \nwere \nboth\nexpressly-designated help concerning orphan children.\nAnd with the exception of the later of those\ntransfers which was made one day after the U. S.\nTreasury Department designation of Al-Aqsa, none of\nthose transfers is alleged to have been made after Holy\nLand or Al-Aqsa was designated as providing material\nsupport to HAMAS. \n[p.9] \nAs to the third alleged customer, Union of Good, the\ncomplaint doesn\u2019t have a single allegation about any\nfinancial transactions in that purported account. \nAt the very most, what the complaint alleges is that\nBLOM provided financial services to three entities, two\nof which were later determined by the U. S.\ngovernment to have provided financial support to\nHAMAS. This case is on all-fours with Siegel, where\nthat was exactly the allegation made against HSBC\nwith respect to Al Rajhi Bank, which was also later\ndesignated an SDGT by the Treasury Department. \n\nApp. 109\nThe complaint does not make any non-conclusory\nallegations that BLOM knew that Sanabil, Subul\nAl-Khair or Union of Good was affiliated with HAMAS\nat the time of any of the attacks. But even if it did, that\nwould not be enough to allege that BLOM had a\ngeneral \nawareness \nof \na \nrole \nin \nviolent \nor\nlife-threatening activities. \nAs I said, the Second Circuit plainly drew a line in\nLinde between providing support for terrorist\norganizations and supporting terrorist acts. And in\nSiegel, that principle was applied to uphold the\ndismissal of the complaint against HSBC. Excuse me.\nTurning for a moment to substantial assistance, the\ncomplaint does not allege that critical element of an\naiding and abetting claim either. As noted, there are no\nallegations \nwhatsoever \nabout \nany \nfinancial\ntransactions into or out of \n[p.10] \nUnion of Good account. \nAnd while the complaint does allege that certain\nfunds were transferred into the Sanabil and Subul\nAl-Khair accounts, it makes no allegation that any of\nthose funds were sent to HAMAS or that any of those\nfunds had a role in any terrorist activity at all, much\nless the specific attacks at issue in this case. \nIf I might, Your Honor, in our briefs, we discussed\nseveral recent district court cases that apply Linde to\ndismiss aiding and abetting claims similar to those\nalleged here. There\u2019s a more recent case that was\n\nApp. 110\nissued by Judge Daniels after briefing, and if I might\nhand it to -- \nTHE COURT: We\u2019re aware of it. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: You\u2019re aware of Kaplan, Your\nHonor? Okay. And I\u2019ve given a copy to Mr. Radine as\nwell. So he\u2019s aware of it as well. \nTHE COURT: Thank you. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: And we believe that Judge\nKaplan\u2019s decision -- \nTHE COURT: Judge Daniels. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Judge Daniels\u2019 decision in\nKaplan is particularly apt here. I mean, there, the\nclaim like here, was against a Lebanese bank. That\nLebanese bank was accused of holding accounts for five\ncustomers \nwho \nwere \nallegedly \naffiliated \nwith\nHezbollah. The claim was based on -- the \n[p.11] \nclaim of aiding and abetting was based on assertions\nthat these five account holders were either Hezbollah\nleaders or entities that had been created and controlled\nby Hezbollah. \nThe complaint in that case further alleged that in\nthe two years before the rocket attacks that had caused\nthose plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, Hezbollah made and received\nwire transfers totaling millions of dollars through those\nfive customer accounts, and more specifically, that\nHezbollah perpetrated the attacks using funds received\n\nApp. 111\nfrom those wire transfers and that those funds were\nsufficient to carry out the attacks. \nThe Kaplan plaintiffs asserted that Lebanese\nCanadian Bank knew or should have known that the\ncustomers were affiliated with Hezbollah, and Judge\nDaniels expressly noted that Lebanese Canadian Bank\nhad later been designated a primary money laundering\nconcern, and that it had forfeited $102 million to the U.\nS. government after being charged with involvement in\na money laundering scheme with links to Hezbollah.\nNonetheless, Judge Daniels still held that those\nallegations were not enough to show general awareness\nof a role in violent or life-threatening activities.\nSimilarly, Judge Daniels held that the complaint\ndid not plead substantial assistance because it did not\nallege that Hezbollah actually received any of the funds\nthat had \n[p.12] \ngone into the five customers\u2019 accounts or that the\ndefendant knew or intended that Hezbollah would\nreceive the funds. Those allegations, we contend, Your\nHonor, are far stronger than anything alleged in this\ncase against Bank BLOM. \nIn, sum there is nothing in the complaint that\nadequately alleges knowing participation or substantial\nassistance to a terrorist attack. \nBecause the plaintiffs expressly declined the\nopportunity to amend their complaint after receiving\n\nApp. 112\nour premotion conference letter, we respectfully\nrequest that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice.\nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you. \nDoes the plaintiff want to be heard? \nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor. Sorry. \nGood afternoon, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Good afternoon. \nMR. RADINE: BLOM essentially makes three \u201ceven\nif\u201d arguments: Its clients weren\u2019t HAMAS. Even if they\nwere, BLOM didn\u2019t know that they were HAMAS, and\neven if they did, they believe its clients only had\ncharitable purposes, meaning under its reading of\nLinde, it could not have been generally aware of its role\nin violence or terrorist activities. \nTHE COURT: But you\u2019re not alleging that these\nthree account holders were HAMAS, right? \nMR. RADINE: They are. We allege that they are as\n[p.13] \nunder Weiss, components of HAMAS. They are\nalteregos of HAMAS, as we allege in the complaint.\nThey are -- they consist of HAMAS\u2019 Da\u2019wa, D-A-W-A,\nheadquarters in Lebanon. \nAs under the control test there, they share the same\nleadership. We\u2019re referring specifically to Sanabil here.\nThey were created by HAMAS to increase HAMAS\u2019 role\nin the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. \n\nApp. 113\nTHE \nCOURT: \nThey\u2019re \nnonviolent, \nnot\nterrorist-related activities, just to provide orphans care,\nscholarships, charitable contributions, you know,\nbetween 40 to $50 per family, and to solidify or to grow\nsupport for HAMAS, but not to engage in terrorism.\nMR. RADINE: That\u2019s their stated purpose, and if\nthey had no other role and if HAMAS operated like a\nnormal organization, then that might mean that\nproviding material assistance to those organizations\nwould not, as under Halberstam, make you generally\naware of your role in conduct from which violence was\nforeseeable, which is the standard under Halberstam.\nTHE COURT: Did you sue these entities, these\naccount holders? \nMR. RADINE: Sorry? \nTHE COURT: Did you sue these three account\nholders? \nMR. RADINE: No, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Why wouldn\u2019t you do that if they are\n[p.14] \nHAMAS? Why wouldn\u2019t you sue them if they are\nresponsible for the terrorist acts that led to the horrible\ninjuries suffered by your clients? \nMR. RADINE: As Judge Posner pointed out in\nBoim, the very existence of the ATA civil provision is to\nallow plaintiffs to find some recovery for their injuries\naside from the terror groups themselves, which are\n\nApp. 114\nusually hard to find or don\u2019t have the resources to cover\nany sort of judgment. \nSanabil was shut down by the Lebanese government\nin 2003 for its role -- working with HAMAS. The other\norganizations have taken essentially the same path,\nmaking suing them impossible. \nBut under defendant\u2019s view, suing a bank would be\nimpossible because these organizations have ostensibly\nor purportedly charitable purposes, but the question\nunder Halberstam is whether -- which is the governing\nlaw as laid out in Linde -- is whether you have a\ngeneral awareness of your role in the overall tortious or\nillegal conduct that is not itself violent, but from which\nviolence is foreseeable. \nSo in that case, of course, Mrs. Hamilton, the\ngirlfriend of the burglar, doesn\u2019t know about the\nmurder that her boyfriend would go on to commit. She\ndoesn\u2019t even know about the burglary. She simply has\na general awareness of her role -- and the Court\u2019s line\nwas personal property crimes at night from which\nobjectively, violence is a foreseeable \n[p.15] \nresult. \nThat\u2019s the case here, too. And in fact -- \nTHE COURT: Well, what are you saying that\nBLOM Bank was aware of with regard to these three\naccount holders? \nMR. RADINE: They were aware that they were\nHAMAS alteregos, and that providing financial\n\nApp. 115\nassistance for them would allow HAMAS to perpetuate\nmore terror attacks as a result. \nTHE COURT: What are the facts that you allege\nthat say that they -- BLOM Bank -- knew that these\nwere HAMAS alteregos? \nMR. RADINE: Well, HAMAS -- \nTHE COURT: Did they -- it seems that all of the --\nall of your allegations that are in the complaint talk\nabout the charitable transfers of money that the three\naccount holders made, not that BLOM Bank was aware\nthat these account holders were HAMAS, and that they\nwere knowledgeable about the violent activities, the\nviolent side of the HAMAS operation. \nMR. RADINE: So there are two components. One is\nthe knowledge that they are part of HAMAS. HAMAS,\neven itself, not talking about its components under\nother names, performs a number of social activities.\nThe separate question is one about where they\u2019d\nunderstand that a foreseeable result of promoting those\nsocial activities is -- would foreseeably lead to violence.\n[p.16] \nTHE COURT: But how is giving money to an\norphan or a scholarship to a student in order to camp\ngoing to foreseeably lead to violence? \nMR. RADINE: Well, that transaction itself may not\nbut giving money to HAMAS, which is what that\noperation -- handing the money to Sanabil and\ninstitutions like that does. This is not just our view. It\u2019s\nthe finding of the federal government as deferred to in\n\nApp. 116\n-- by the Supreme Court in Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project. If I could just briefly read from that? \nThe Supreme Court found in the executive\u2019s view,\nsub-quote, given the purposes, organizational structure\nand \nclandestine \nnature \nof \nforeign \nterrorist\norganizations, it is highly likely that any material\nsupport to these organizations will ultimately enure to\nthe benefit of their criminal terrorist functions,\nregardless of whether such support was ostensibly\nintended \nto \nsupport \nnon-violent, \nnon-terrorist\nactivities. And that\u2019s at 561 U. S. 1 at 33. \nIt\u2019s also the finding of the U. S. designation of\nSanabil, which I\u2019ll come to in a moment, but in brief,\nthat designation finds that HAMAS uses its charitable\ninstitutions for cover, that it commingles assets --\nanother sign of alterego status, by the way -- and that\nit shifts money from the charities -- the line is, monies\nfrom the charities are, quote, often diverted or\nsyphoned to support terrorism. \n[p.17] \nI don\u2019t think any of this would have been lost on\nBLOM, operating in Lebanon -- Lebanon, where\nHezbollah has -- another foreign terrorist organization\nruns a substantial non-society -- nor would it have been\nlost on BLOM in terms of HAMAS\u2019 role in the\nPalestinian refugee camps, especially in southern\nLebanon. \nSo for instance, BLOM\u2019s -- the Sanabil account was\nwith BLOM\u2019s branch in the city of Sidon, a small city in\nLebanon, where enormous sums of money were coming\n\nApp. 117\ninto Sanabil, especially in a country whose per capita\nGDP at the time was around five thousand dollars. \nAnd Sanabil\u2019s stated purpose was to operate in the\nrefugee camps where HAMAS was active. None of this\nwould have gone unnoticed by BLOM Bank. Just as\nmuch as when the millions of dollars coming in from\nHLF, Holy Land Foundation, as far as we know, so far\nfrom the evidence in that trial, stopped when it was\ndesignated as a HAMAS fundraiser. \nAll of this is information that BLOM has to\nunderstand that it is dealing with a HAMAS\norganization, Sanabil, whose fundraisers abroad are\ndesignated because that sort of support leads to\nterrorism. \nTHE COURT: All right. But you don\u2019t have any\ndirect evidence, do you, that Sanabil actually directly\nfunded terrorist activities with funds on account or that\nhad transferred through the BLOM Bank, do you?\n[p.18] \nMR. RADINE: We don\u2019t have any sort of purchasing\nof weapons or allegations of that nature, but those\nallegations haven\u2019t been necessary. It\u2019s not Linde,\nwhich is in a line of cases explaining there is no need to\ntrace a transaction from the bank all the way to the\npurchase of weapons, as explained in Holder. \nTHE COURT: Right, but you have to show some\nknowledge on the part of the bank, don\u2019t you, that they\nknew that the funds that they were -- that they were\nassisting with, the transactions that they were\nassisting with, were going towards terrorist activities.\n\nApp. 118\nAnd, you know, the fact that there is money going\ninto the refugee camps, I don\u2019t know how large these\ncamps are or how many people they are actually\nserving during this time, but in August 2001, HAMAS\nprovided funds to provide basic necessities to poor\nfamilies within the camps. How many people were in\nthese camps? \nI mean, I\u2019m not -- it seems like a lot of money, but I\ndon\u2019t even know what the population is and whether\nthat would send red flags up to a bank that, oh, gee,\nthese monies going into these camps are for terrorists\nas opposed to charitable activities. I just don\u2019t see any\nknowledge on the part of the bank here. \nMR. RADINE: The knowledge is not to where the\nspecific transactions go, because the bank understands\nthat \n[p.19] \nmoney is fungible and because the bank understands\nthat HAMAS is a foreign terrorist organization, and\nthat \nthese \ncomponents \nare \npart \nof \nHAMAS\ninfrastructure. That\u2019s all the knowledge that is\nnecessary. \nThe ATA won\u2019t operate if we would have to show a\ntransaction marked for bombs or for guns. They\u2019ll\nalways say for charitable purposes, and if that money\nis paid to a charitable purpose, it frees up -- this is the\nholding in Goldberg. \nTHE COURT: I think in some of the cases that were\ncited, they actually did earmark certain payments to\nsuicide bombers\u2019 families as opposed to here, where\n\nApp. 119\nthey were giving scholarships and taking care of\norphans and that kind of thing. \nMR. RADINE: In Linde, there are allegations or\nrather evidence at trial. That\u2019s a post-trial decision that\nArab Bank helped operate an insurance fund to pay\nfamilies of suicide bombers. That\u2019s certainly better\nevidence at that stage of the bank\u2019s knowledge, but it\ndoesn\u2019t mean that because a bank doesn\u2019t have that list\nin front of it, it can\u2019t understand the role of charity\nfoundations in HAMAS. \nI\u2019d point out that the charities involved here include\ncharities that pay to suicide bomber families. That\u2019s\npart of the findings of the Watson memo on Holy Land\nFoundation. That same -- it\u2019s actually a great example\nof how \n[p.20] \ncharity payments can very directly encourage\nterrorism, and BLOM doesn\u2019t need at the pleading\nstage, at least, that sort of allegation to understand its\nrole in supporting HAMAS and providing that amount\nof liquidity to HAMAS. \nThe result otherwise is to simply immunize any sort\nof banking for a foreign terrorist organization if they\nare bright enough to simply move money straight to\ntheir charitable wing under charitable purposes as\nopposed to requesting money for violent purposes. \nIt\u2019s the reason why the United States found, as\nnoted in Holder, that that money will ultimately enure\nto the benefit of terrorist functions, regardless of how\n\nApp. 120\nit was ostensibly intended -- something, again, that\nBLOM would have understood. \nTHE COURT: I think the defense points out in its\npapers that you waited until the very last possible\nmoment to name the BLOM Bank, where you sued\nnumerous other parties involved in the injuries\nsustained by your clients, you know, since -- almost\nsince the day of the injury. And sort of -- I think the\ndefendant is making an argument that it is sort of a\nlast ditch effort, you decided, well, let\u2019s just name the\nbank before the statute expires, because you may not\nhave had the ability to collect from other more direct\nplayers in this whole thing. \nMR. RADINE: Yeah. It was a disappointing\nargument \n[p.21] \nto read, given that our plaintiffs had the legal right to\nbring the case. The statute hasn\u2019t run on their claims.\nIt struck me as a disparaging remark about their sort\nof -- whether it\u2019s abberatious bringing of stale claims or\nnot. The claims against BLOM Bank are no less direct\nthan Arab Bank, unlike HSBC, for instance, in Siegel.\nHSBC held an account for a bank that held an\naccount for a charity that was not the alterego of\nHAMAS or al-Qaeda in Iraq, but simply had given\nsome money to both of them. There is no evidence, for\ninstance, that any money from HSBC ever made it to\nthose charities or to the terrorist organizations, either.\n\nApp. 121\nHere, like Arab Bank, BLOM holds accounts for the\ncharitable institutions that are part of HAMAS. That\u2019s\ntrue in Linde as well. \nTHE COURT: Where do you allege that in your\ncomplaint that BLOM Bank knew that these account\nholders are alteregos or are a part of, or the same as\nHAMAS? \nMR. RADINE: I think certainly for pleading\npurposes, it\u2019s a plausible inference from the -- \nTHE COURT: Just give me a couple of paragraphs\n-- I\u2019ve got the complaint here -- \nMR. RADINE: Sure. \nTHE COURT: -- where you make that clear. \nMR. RADINE: So in paragraphs 588 to 594, for\n[p.22] \ninstance, we set out some of Sanabil\u2019s history and that\nits board was composed of HAMAS officials in Lebanon,\nand I point out that HAMAS in Lebanon operates\nopenly. These aren\u2019t secret -- secret terrorists hiding in\nthe shadows. This is information -- especially in Sidon\n-- that would have been evident to BLOM that these\nwere HAMAS institutions. The same is true for the\nHLF transactions. \nTHE COURT: Well, you don\u2019t allege that here, do\nyou? \nMR. RADINE: That BLOM knew as a result that it\nwas HAMAS? \n\nApp. 122\nTHE COURT: Yes. \nMR. RADINE: Your Honor, I think we\u2019ve presented\nit as a plausible inference from the allegations. \nTHE COURT: All right. \nMR. RADINE: I just want to add to -- if I may, Your\nHonor, to the purported staleness of the claims.\nDefendant also wrote that the time the claims were\nbrought, the statute of limitations was ten years long.\nThat\u2019s not the case. The time the claims starting out\nwere brought -- the times that the attacks occurred. \nAt the time that the attacks occurred, the statute of\nlimitations was four years long. BLOM\u2019s role in\nfinancing HAMAS did not become clear until the HLF\ntrial in 2008, after those claims would have run. \n[p.23] \nIn 2013, the statute of limitations was extended to\nten years with a saving provision capturing post-9/11\nclaims that included our plaintiffs. So it\u2019s not until\n2013 that they can bring a claim based on the\ninformation from the HLF trial. And even then, it\u2019s not\nuntil 2016 that JASTA is passed, providing a more\nstraightforward \npath \nto \nliability. \nSo \nthe\ncharacterization itself is not only unnecessary, it\u2019s\nsimply inaccurate. \nTHE COURT: What about the proximate cause of\nthe injuries suffered by the Steinherz family? They\nclaim -- the defense claims that those are not -- the\nallegations don\u2019t establish that the Steinherz family\n\nApp. 123\ninjuries were proximately caused by the Ben Yehuda\nStreet -- \nMR. RADINE: Ben Yehuda Street bombing? \nTHE COURT: Yes. \nMR. RADINE: They characterize -- it\u2019s a little\nmystifying to us. To lay out what happened, the Ben\nYehuda Street bombing took place in a pedestrian mall.\nThe Steinherzs were in the area of the attack. They\nheard the attack. They feared for their lives. They also\nheard two bombings, knowing that multiple bombings\nsometimes occur in order to kill first responders. \nThey got up to leave -- defendant treats their\ndecision that they were then safe as meaning the\nattack was over as a matter of truth and they would\nnever fear for their \n[p.24] \nlives \nuntil \nsome \nintervening \nevent \nhappened.\nNaturally, they\u2019re seeking to escape an attack that they\ncan\u2019t know if it\u2019s over or not. When they see a\ncrazed-looking man after two bombers, they have the\nreasonable fear that this is a third bomber, and react\naccordingly. \nIt\u2019s certainly within Halberstam a foreseeable result\nof the fundraising for HAMAS as much as the injuries\nin the other attacks were. \nTHE COURT: Do you want to address the\nnon-citizenship status of Matanya Nathanson? \n\nApp. 124\nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor. The -- Matanya has\na claim as the survivor of his daughter who was\nmurdered in that attack. His own physical injuries for\nthat attack don\u2019t constitute their only claim, but our\nargument is that well, simply, we\u2019re not sure what is\nbeing asked of the Court to do with it. \nThe evidence of his solation injuries, as in the\ninjuries from losing his daughter, how that is related to\nhis physical or emotional injuries from the attack itself\nis something to be determined by a jury, with -- a\nproperly instructed jury at that stage? \nBut aside from excluding certain evidence or\nwhatever the Court might do at a later stage with that,\nthere\u2019s no part of the claim to dismiss here on those\ngrounds. \nTHE COURT: All right. So right now, we\u2019re just\n[p.25] \nlooking at the sufficiency of your pleadings? \nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: And your -- I do recall that you did\nnot want an opportunity to try to replead, which is\nusually what we try to encourage the plaintiffs to do\nbefore motion practice. And I think the Second Circuit\nmay not encourage district courts to allow another\nround of pleading if there\u2019s been a declination of an\nopportunity to replead before motion practice. \nSo everything I need to consider in terms of\nsufficiency of your pleading is going to be found in the\ncomplaint that\u2019s filed in this case, correct? \n\nApp. 125\nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor. The -- \nTHE COURT: There are no facts that you would\nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of the\ndefendants regarding knowledge, especially? \nMR. RADINE: I think we could always add\nallegations, but the -- we believe the complaint goes far\nenough in saying that BLOM holding accounts for\nSpecially Designated Global Terrorists designated for\nthis conduct for financing HAMAS, was generally\naware of its role in that elicit conduct, and was -- the\nviolence that resulted from it was foreseeable, as was\nthe case in Linde. \nAnd Linde, of course, is a decision on a, you know,\non jury instructions. It didn\u2019t hold that there was a\n[p.26] \npleading bar here. In fact, when Linde holds that\nprovision of material support to an FTO is not enough\nfrom a general awareness point of view, it cites to\nHolder, a case in which presumably well-meaning NGO\nprovided \nde-escalation, \nanti-violence, \nsort \nof\ninternational law training to a terrorist group in hopes\nthat it would turn to less violent ends. That is a\nviolation of 2339B. It is a provision of material support\nto a terrorist group, but it may not objectively make\nviolence a foreseeable result of it. \nThat\u2019s different than here. As would have been\nunderstood to BLOM or to any reasonable person and\nas was found by the United States government,\nproviding millions of dollars to HSBC\u2019s -- sorry -- I\u2019ll get\nback to HSBC in a moment -- millions of dollars to\n\nApp. 126\nHAMAS, whether it\u2019s its Da\u2019wa wing or otherwise,\nforeseeably leads to violence. \nMy only HSBC comment is to just offer a little\ncorrection. Al Rajhi was never designated. The\nAl-Haramain, the charity it held accounts for was, but\nthat was not designated as an alterego for HAMAS or\nal-Qaeda, whereas Sanabil, I think it was clear from\nthe designation -- I\u2019m happy to read further from that\nif it would benefit the Court -- was designated because\nit was being used as cover for HAMAS, because it was\nused to facilitate funding and to funnel money and\nbecause its assets were commingled or diverted or\nsyphoned to support terrorism. \n[p.27] \nParticularly under the scienter standard preferred\nin the Second Circuit, the motion to dismiss a case,\nunder In Re: DDAVP, which is set out in Weiss also and\nin our complaint, even tenuous inferences, scienter\nshould be enough at the pleading stage, and we think\nwe have more than tenuous inferences here. \nTHE COURT: Is the Kaplan case on appeal? \nMR. RADINE: I don\u2019t know that the appeal has\nbeen filed. The Notice of Appeal has been filed. \nIf I could speak briefly to Kaplan? Kaplan requires\na level of proof that is out of step with JASTA, out of\nstep with Linde, and would be impossible to meet. Just\nreading from page six of that decision, \u201cPlaintiffs do not\nadvance any factual non-conclusory allegations that\ndefendants knowingly and intentionally supported\nHezbollah in perpetrating the rocket attacks.\u201d \n\nApp. 127\nThat\u2019s not a standard that courts have required\nplaintiffs to meet. It wouldn\u2019t operate in Halberstam.\nMs. Hamilton did not knowingly, intentionally assist\nher boyfriend in murdering Dr. Halberstam. \nThe Kaplan case also requires -- I\u2019ll just read it\nagain from page six, \u201cPlaintiffs do not plausibly allege\nthat Hezbollah received any of those funds or that\ndefendant knew or intended that Hezbollah receive the\nfunds, nor do they sufficiently allege that defendant\nknew prior to the attacks \n[p.28] \nthat any affiliations between Hezbollah and the five\ncustomers, whether there were those affiliations.\u201d \nThis is not our allegation here. Our allegation here\nis that any money for Sanabil is a money for HAMAS.\nIt\u2019s also the finding of the U. S. government. It\u2019s our\nallegation that that was something that was known to\nBLOM. I think it was certainly known to LCB as well,\nbut that was that decision in that case. \nRespectfully, a case that requires knowledge of\npurchasing of rockets is, as a minimum, is going to\nrender the ATA a dead letter, and certainly make\nHalberstam irrelevant to the analysis. \nI point out also, Your Honor, that the fact that\nSanabil is part of HAMAS is also a finding in the 2012\ndecision in the Boim line of cases, which obviously does\nnot bind this Court, but is indicative of information\nthat\u2019s certainly sufficient at the pleading stage. \n\nApp. 128\nIn Boim v. Quranic Literacy Institute, 2012 Westlaw\n13171764, the court said, \u201cThe evidence further shows\nthat all of these organizations\u201d -- and that list included\nSanabil -- \u201care either known fronts for HAMAS, known\nsupporters of HAMAS, or entities whose funding is\nknown to benefit the HAMAS agenda.\u201d \nI think the evidence shows that Sanabil\u2019s firmly in\nthe front for HAMAS for category of those particular\n[p.29] \norganizations. \nI\u2019m happy to discuss substantial assistance, if that\u2019s\nhelpful. \nTHE COURT: No. Anything else? I mean, your\nresponse to the defense motions, if you have anything\nelse to add? Otherwise, I\u2019ll hear from Ms. Goldstein.\nMR. RADINE: No, I think that will do it for\nplaintiffs. Thank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Ms. Goldstein, do you want to be\nheard any further? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. \nI would like to start where I started before, which is\nwith words of the statute. We\u2019re here to interpret and\napply a specific statute, JASTA, which was enacted in\n2016, and which is not addressed in Halberstam or\nBoim or Goldberg, because it didn\u2019t even exist at that\ntime. \nSo the key points are the words in the statute which\nrequires knowing and substantial assistance to a\n\nApp. 129\nterrorist act. And we have the further gloss from Linde\nthat the statute requires with respect to a financial\ninstitution such as BLOM, a general awareness of the\nbank\u2019s role in terrorist acts and violent and\nlife-threatening activities. \nThe Holder decision by the U. S. Supreme Court\nwas not interpreting JASTA. Again, JASTA hadn\u2019t\nbeen enacted at the time the Supreme Court issued the\nHolder decision. The \n[p.30] \nSupreme Court was looking at one of the material\nsupport statutes. And one of the keys here is that the\nLinde decision expressly says that the mens rea\nstandard for the material support statute is different\nthan the mens rea requirement for JASTA. \nLooking at pages 329 to 330 of the Second Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in Linde, first, the court says what I read\nearlier, what the jury did have to find was that in\nproviding such services, the bank was generally aware\nthat it was playing a role in HAMAS\u2019 violent or\nlife-endangering activities. \nSecond Circuit then goes on to say expressly, \u201cThis\nis different from the mens rea required to establish\nmaterial support in violation of 18 USC, Section 2339B,\nwhich requires only knowledge of the organization\u2019s\nconnection to terrorism, not intent to further its\nterrorist activities or awareness that one is playing a\nrole in those activities. See Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project.\u201d So the Second Circuit has told us don\u2019t\nlook at the Holder case. That\u2019s not the standard here.\n\nApp. 130\nSimilarly, the Boim case was distinguished by the\nSecond Circuit as well, where the Second Circuit\npointed out that in the Boim case, the Second Circuit\ndid not hold that material support of terrorism is\nalways an international act of terrorism, addressing a\ndefinitional issue that\u2019s not at issue here. \nMr. Radine pointed to the Halberstam case, which\n[p.31] \nrequires only knowledge of participation in tortious\nactivity. But again, the Second Circuit expressly says\nnot just tortious activity. We\u2019re looking at violent or\nlife-threatening activity. That\u2019s what\u2019s required under\nJASTA. \nIt\u2019s not an impossible standard that the Second\nCircuit laid out. The Second Circuit expressly said that\nthe evidence in the Arab Bank case, the Linde case\ncould be enough, and pointing to the terrorism\ninsurance evidence and the like, and the same was\nrecently found by Judge Cogan of this court in the\nMiller versus Arab Bank case, where he denied a\nmotion to dismiss an aiding and abetting claim. \nThe alterego arguments, we submit, Your Honor,\nnumber one, the allegations in the complaint do not\nrise to the level of establishing alterego similarity, and\neven if they did -- even if they did, there is still the\npoint that -- providing material support to a terrorist\norganization. \nSo providing material support, even if you\u2019re\nproviding it directly to HAMAS, is not enough if there\nisn\u2019t knowledge, if there isn\u2019t general awareness of a\n\nApp. 131\nrole in terrorist acts. And Sanabil certainly does more\nthan terrorist acts. The complaint says nothing about\nthem doing terrorist acts. It just talks about charities\nand helping children in the camps and so on. \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of\nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in Kaplan was\nvery much \n[p.32] \nwhat\u2019s claimed here, where it said that it was notorious\nthat there were links between the accounts at issue\nthere, between those persons and in that case,\nHezbollah. \nAnd that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was\napparently notorious that BLOM should have known\nthat these accounts were linked to HAMAS, but there\u2019s\nno direct allegation of why BLOM should have known\nthat. As I pointed out earlier, the designations by the\nU. S. Government all postdate it, the activities at issue\nhere. \nSo, unless Your Honor has any further questions --\nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you. No. I think\nwe\u2019re set. \nIs there anything else you wanted to say, sir? \nMR. RADINE: I\u2019m happy to give a brief response,\nYour Honor, if it is helpful to the Court, to those last\nfew comments. \nTHE COURT: Well, why don\u2019t you just -- whatever\nyou\u2019d like, sir. \n\nApp. 132\nMR. RADINE: Okay. Thank you. \nVery briefly, the JASTA statute says aiding and\nabetting the person who committed the attacks. It does\nnot require that you aid and abet the attacks in some\nway that increases the scienter from what\u2019s laid out in\nHalberstam. \nAs opposing counsel mentioned, Halberstam was\ndecided before JASTA. It\u2019s JASTA that incorporates\n[p.33] \nHalberstam, and that\u2019s approved by Linde. Linde did\nnot seek to raise the standard in Halberstam. I think if\nthe Second Circuit was going to adopt Halberstam and\nthen dispose of it, it would have said so, which it did\nnot. \nAnd finally, the statement that material support to\nan FTO is not enough even if the entity is itself the\nalterego, such as its own support to its sort of parent\nhere, is certainly indicative enough that it would\nrender the ATA a dead letter. \nThe Linde decision did not say don\u2019t look at Holder.\nIt said that the conduct in Holder, which is material\nsupport, is not sufficient to bring in the foreseeability\naspect, but millions of dollars, we allege, is. That\u2019s all,\nYour Honor. \nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you. \nAll right. Thank you. I will take all this under\nadvisement, and will issue a decision. Thank you. \nMR. RADINE: Thank you, Your Honor. \n\nApp. 133\nTHE COURT: Thank you. We\u2019re adjourned.\n(Proceedings concluded.) \n\nApp. 134\n                         \nAPPENDIX G\n                         \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n19 CV 8 (KAM)\n[Dated October 6, 2021]\n_________________________________\nMICHAEL HONICKMAN, et al.,\n)\nPlaintiffs, \n)\n)\nversus \n)\n)\nBLOM BANK SAL,\n)\nDefendant. \n)\n________________________________ )\nU.S. Courthouse Defendant. \nBrooklyn, New York \nOctober 6, 2021 \n3:00 p.m. \nTranscript of Civil Cause for \nTelephone Premotion Conference \nBefore:\nHONORABLE KIYO A.

Blom \n(Via teleconference.) \nTHE COURT: Hello. Good afternoon. This is Judge\nMatsumoto. \nThe case is Michal Honickman, et al. versus Blom\nBank SAL, 19 CV 008. \nMay I have the plaintiffs\u2019 appearance, please. \nMR. RADINE: Good afternoon, Your Honor. This is\nMichael Radine from Osen LLC for plaintiffs, and I\u2019m\njoined today by Gary Osen. \n\nApp. 136\nTHE COURT: All right. Who is going to speak for\nthe plaintiff today, please? \nMR. RADINE: I will, Michael Radine will, Your\nHonor. \nTHE COURT: Okay. Thanks. Just please, sir, make\nsure you identify yourself before you speak. \nWho do we have for the defendant, please? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Linda Goldstein of Dechert LLP,\nfor Blom Bank; and I\u2019m joined today by Michael\nMcGinley and Tamer Mallat. \nTHE COURT: Thank you. Who will be speaking on\nbehalf of the defendant today? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: I will, Linda Goldstein. \nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you. \nHave I overlooked anybody? \nIs there any other party that I haven\u2019t \n[p.3] \nacknowledged? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: No. \nTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you. \nSo I understand that the plaintiffs, despite two\nopportunities to amend and two prior declinations and\nstatements that they don\u2019t have any other facts, are\nnow trying to seek the fact that the circuit standard for\n\nApp. 137\npleading wasn\u2019t clarified at the time and that\u2019s why you\ndidn\u2019t plead. \nI mean that is something the circuit recognized,\nthat they weren\u2019t clear and I applied a standard that\nwas not the appropriate standard; but these are facts,\nand I don\u2019t think anything about the facts that you\nwish to add necessarily adds to, you know, they existed\nat the time you were invited, the plaintiffs were\ninvited, to amend. I\u2019m not sure what reason the\nplaintiffs have for not adding those facts, regardless of\nwhat the standard was, because, as you argued, I\napplied the wrong standard. \nWhy didn\u2019t you make those facts part of an\namended pleading when you were invited to do so? \nMR. RADINE: Sure, Your Honor. This is Michael\nRadine. \nAs you stated, of course, it\u2019s our position that now\nthat the Second Circuit has correctly clarified the\nstandard for pleading a JASTA claim, that we should\nbe able to amend to meet that standard. And, as you\nnoted, the circuit court \n[p.4] \nnoted the confusion in applying the correct standard\nbefore it vacated Kaplan; and, of course, we are no\nmore clairvoyant than this Court in accommodating\nthat standard. \nAny prior amendment would have been futile\nbecause we still cannot allege, as this Court required,\nquote, any acts or statements by Blom or Blom\u2019s\n\nApp. 138\nemployees which suggest any awareness of its\nconnection -- on its part of a connection between any of\nthe three customers and Hamas. So that is the\nknowledge standard that the Court rejected as well as\nthe standard that Blom knew or should have known of\nthe cited sources. \nSo the prior opportunities to amend, which\nplaintiffs did decline, would have been futile to have\nmet. \nI think the more appropriate way to view this is as\nif the Second Circuit\u2019s decision had been this Court\u2019s\ndismissal decision, then we would be in a situation like\nCortac, for instance, where the Second Circuit held\nthat, It is the usual practice upon granting a motion to\ndismiss to allow leave to replead. We are now, for the\nfirst time, in a position to amend based on the correct\nstandard, and we should be given that opportunity. \nThe allegations -- \nTHE COURT: Sir, the question I had was: If the\nstandard wasn\u2019t clear and you were advocating for a\nparticular standard, why wouldn\u2019t you allege facts that\nmet the standard \n[p.5] \nthat you thought was the right standard? \nI\u2019m not quite sure why you wouldn\u2019t allege those\nfacts, which were available at the time. If you were\ntaking the position that the standard that I applied\nwas too exacting, and if these facts existed in the\nuniverse, as you claim they did at the time, and you\n\nApp. 139\nwere advocating that the standard I was applying was\nerroneous -- and you were right about that -- why\nwouldn\u2019t you allege those facts that you were arguing\nwere a different standard? Why does it make it futile?\nMR. RADINE: Well, so, we obviously saw -- \nTHE COURT: That\u2019s a call for me. That\u2019s a call for\nme, in denying an amendment saying, well, that\u2019s\nfutile; but you, as advocate for the plaintiffs, decided I\ndon\u2019t want to avail myself of the opportunity to bring\nforth different facts that would support a claim under\nthe standard that we, the plaintiffs, think is the correct\none. \nMR. RADINE: We thought the allegations we had\nwere sufficient at the time. The circuit disagreed, I\nthink, on a fairly detailed basis. As opposed to rejecting\nour theory of knowledge generally, it found fault with\nspecific deficiencies that we can address. \nBut it\u2019s the same reason, just going back to Cortac,\nthat had this Court applied the correct theory and then\nsaid, but your facts, you know, like on a detail-by-detail\nbasis \n[p.6] \ndon\u2019t meet that standard, this Court would have\nordinarily then given us the opportunity to amend. \nSo we didn\u2019t add -- just to be clear, that general --\nthat general, allow us to let plaintiffs to replead in that\nsituation was not based on newly discovered evidence.\nThat\u2019s based on the Court saying, this is the correct\nstandard, here is where I have identified a couple or\n\nApp. 140\nhowever many deficiencies, so long as the general\ntheory is correct, and can you meet those. We just now\nhave that decision from the circuit in this case, and we\nbelieve we can meet those. \nTHE COURT: Well, my understanding of Second\nCircuit law was that a change in decisional law is not\na basis for 60(b) relief. \nMR. RADINE: That would be a change in decisional\nlaw in another case. \nSo once this case ended and then, you know,\nhowever many years or whatever down the line a\ndecision comes out that\u2019s more favorable for us, then,\nyou know, that\u2019s too bad. You take the law as you have\nit in the case while you are in it; but this is the same\ncase. This is on appeal. \nTHE COURT: Kaplan came down. It\u2019s a different\ncase, correct? \nMR. RADINE: Yes, but not only after this lower\ncase had been decided, but after we briefed and argued\nHonickman above. \n[p.7] \nTHE COURT: Well, if that were the case, why -- I\nmean, wouldn\u2019t you have expected the Second Circuit\nto have vacated my decision? \nMR. RADINE: The Second Circuit found, I think,\nample specific factual deficiencies that it held weren\u2019t\nenough. \n\nApp. 141\nIt\u2019s just as if this Court, again, might have come to\nthe same conclusion, might have had the correct\nstandard, and then directed plaintiffs, if they are able\nto, to correct those deficiencies. I think it\u2019s a different\ncase than if the Second Circuit had said the Court\nstandard is wrong but plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is off\nbase as well. \nOur theory of liability is correct, but there are\nspecific factual allegational deficiencies that the Court\nidentified that we should be able to address. \nTHE COURT: I mean, I have seen Second Circuit\ndecisions that reverse and remand the district court\nfrom further proceedings consistent with their decision.\nHere, my understanding is the circuit just said\nalthough I, the district court, applied the incorrect\nstandard, we nonetheless affirm the dismissal with\nprejudice and the judgment that was entered to that\neffect; and there was no indication that defendant come\nback for further proceedings or there should be further\nproceedings. \nMR. RADINE: Well, I think that\u2019s -- I\u2019m sorry, Your\n[p.8] \nHonor. \nTHE COURT: Okay. I\u2019m just not sure that there is,\nyou know, given the record -- and I did really try to get\nyou all, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, to take the opportunity\nto amend even under a standard that you thought was\ncorrect. Right? \n\nApp. 142\nI mean, your argument now that it would have been\nfutile is your argument, but futility and amendment is\na call for the Court, not for the litigant. So if you\nthought there should be a different standard and that\nyou had facts that support that, then you should have\navailed yourself of that opportunity. \nBecause really, this was, you know, talk about the\nwhole issue of encouraging finality of judgment and the\nexacting high standard for 60(b)(6) relief. It\u2019s a very\ndifficult standard to meet. \nEven you acknowledge in your papers that this\nliberal amendment language that you get from Foman\nversus Davis, et cetera, is really diminished by the fact\nthat you were given the opportunity that you didn\u2019t\navail yourself. \nThe other case you cite, either there wasn\u2019t a\nrequest to amend or -- yes. \nSo I\u2019m just not sure that you are on very firm\nground for a vacatur. I think -- look, I will let the\ndefendant be heard. \nMR. RADINE: Could I, Your Honor, just address\nthose \n[p.9] \nstatements, if I could? \nTHE COURT: Go ahead. \nMR. RADINE: So in the cases we cited, Williams,\nFoman, and SAIC, and so on, underlying the\npost-judgment relief was sought on decisions that were\n\nApp. 143\ncorrect. Those were just plaintiffs seeking to add\nallegations to meet the correct standard from the\nCourt. There was nothing else that was required to\novercome the vacatur standard. \nThe case that goes the other way, Metzler, that we\nraised in our letter, doesn\u2019t disagree with that at all or\nsay those cases are wrongly decided. It just says that\nwhere -- and I just want to make sure I\u2019m quoting this\ncorrectly -- it says, acknowledges the liberal spirit of\nRule 15 and says that it applies where the plaintiff\nfailed to do so repeatedly after having, quote, the\nbenefit of an opinion that, quote, identified the defects\nthat a second amended complaint should cure. \nThat is an opportunity that plaintiffs are just\ngetting now, but, otherwise, there is nothing about the\nvacatur standard in the context of amending a\ncomplaint post-judgment that requires something more\nextraordinary than just having sufficient allegations,\nmuch less having the correct standard available to\nplaintiffs to meet. I think ultimately it\u2019s a question of\nfairness, and the Supreme Court\u2019s direction to let\nmeritorious claims go forward \n[p.10] \nnotwithstanding the sort of strange procedural history\nthat this case had. \nTHE COURT: That\u2019s whether the claim is\nmeritorious, not that the claim is per se meritorious.\nYou are correcting the language of the Supreme Court\nthere, because it\u2019s, you know, one must be afforded an\nopportunity to test the claim on the merits; but, I\nthink, as you acknowledge in your letter, both in\n\nApp. 144\nWilliams and in Foman there was not a request by the\nplaintiff to amend. \nNow, you are trying to say, well, like them, we\ndidn\u2019t request to amend; but the details, in my mind\nand what sticks in my mind, is you were asked twice.\nWhy didn\u2019t you just amend? Why didn\u2019t you try to fix\nthis situation rather than have the defendant and the\nCourt -- talk about fairness to the defendant -- but to go\nthrough and move against this voluminous complaint,\nwhy not try to fix it now. \nSo it\u2019s not that you never sought to amend. You\nwere invited; and I don\u2019t want to say I begged you to\namend, but I certainly encouraged you to think about\namending, and twice you said no. \nMR. RADINE: Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Anyway, Mr. Radine, did have you\nanything else before I hear from the defendant? \nMR. RADINE: Judge, just to note again that we\ndidn\u2019t, of course, know any better than the Court what\nthe \n[p.11] \nstandard would be to amend. We believed we had the\ncorrect allegations, and now we have the guidance from\nthe circuit in this case that we should be able to\npursue. \nAnd, of course, we are happy to brief that at further\nlength, if the Court wants briefing on this issue; but,\naside from that, I will step back and let the defendant\nspeak. \n\nApp. 145\nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Your Honor. This is\nLinda Goldstein. \nFirst, I think we need to step back and consider\nwhat the state of the law was at each time that the\nplaintiffs declined the opportunity that it was given to\namend. So the first opportunity was at the premotion\nconference; and at that point, obviously, this Court had\nnot ruled on the motion. We had submitted a premotion\nconference letter, in which we argued that none of the\nallegations in the complaint established that Blom was\naware of the connection between the alleged customers\nand Hamas and Hamas\u2019 act of terrorism at the time\nthat it provided banking services. \nSo at that point the plaintiffs knew that Blom was\nraising a defense that the -- I guess retrospective\nallegations alleging that information was in the public\ndomain after the time that Blom provided banking\nservices was not sufficient, that plaintiffs had to\nprovide evidence of awareness at the time that the\nservices were provided, and the \n[p.12] \nplaintiffs at that point were invited to amend and\ndeclined the opportunity to do so. \nThere was no allegation in our premotion conference\nletter that there had to be signs of knowledge from\nBlom employees in order to state a claim. \nThe second opportunity that plaintiff was given to\namend was at the oral argument of the motion, and at\nthat point this Court had not yet issued its decision;\nand so, there was no erroneous standard that the\n\nApp. 146\nplaintiff was being asked to cure. Again, the issue was\nBlom\u2019s awareness and whether there was any\nallegation of publicly available facts at the time that\nBlom was providing banking services, you know, prior\nto the attacks, that connected any of the alleged\ncustomers to Hamas\u2019 terrorist activities. \nAgain, plaintiffs declined the opportunity to amend\ntheir complaint; and, in fact, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said\nthat we could always allege more facts but chose to rest\nupon the complaint. \nThen, the Court issued its decision; and, Your\nHonor, I think you are being a little hard on yourself\nbecause the decision expressed multiple bases for\ndismissing of the complaint and multiple bases for\nfinding that the general awareness allegations were\ndeficient. One of those, the Second Circuit held, was\nnot correct, that the plaintiff does not have to allege\nevidence that Blom employees had read \n[p.13] \npublicly available information. \nBut the Court did hold that there was in fact no\nallegation of publicly available information prior to the\nlast of the attacks. In fact, that was the basis that the\nSecond Circuit ultimately affirmed on, that there was\na lack of evidence that at the time that Blom provided\nthe banking services there was publicly available\ninformation connecting any of the three alleged\ncustomers to Hamas or to Hamas\u2019 terrorist activities.\nSo I don\u2019t accept the premise that plaintiffs were\nunaware of the standard and of the kinds of facts that\n\nApp. 147\nneeded to be alleged. Certainly not the first time it\ndeclined the chance to amend, certainly not the second\ntime it declined the chance to amend, and then not\neven after this Court issued its opinion. \nWhat plaintiffs could have done after this Court\nissued its opinion was what the plaintiffs did in the\nother cases on which they rely, which is move to vacate\nand to amend after the judgment was issued; but,\nagain, plaintiffs chose not to do that. They chose\ninstead to appeal, which they certainly had a right to\ndo; but, as part of their appeal, they could have, but did\nnot, challenge the Court\u2019s decision not to permit\namendment, which the Court addressed in its opinion\nwhen it held that it was dismissing the complaint with\nprejudice. \n[p.14] \nI guess, finally, plaintiffs could have, in the course\nof their appeal, you know, said to the Second Circuit,\nand if you reject the standard we want a chance to\nplead additional facts, which was done in the Schwab\ncase that we cited in our opposition to plaintiffs\u2019\nrequest for a premotion conference. \nSo effectively, Your Honor, we are saying that there\nwere four separate chances that they had, either to tell\nthis Court or the Second Circuit, that there were\nadditional facts that could cure the deficient general\nawareness standard, and they never chose to do so.\nThere is no basis to distinguish this case from the\ncases that we cited holding that a change in decisional\nlaw is not a basis for 60(b) relief. First, because we\ndon\u2019t think that there was, in a material respect, a\n\nApp. 148\nchange in the law because this Court held that there\nwas no publicly available information at the time of the\nservices, and that is what the Second Circuit ultimately\naffirmed on. \nSecond, all of the cases permitting vacatur and\namendment that we have been able to find, and\ncertainly that the plaintiffs have cited, involved\nrequests that were made prior to an appeal. So we have\nnow had an appeal, plaintiffs had a chance to make the\narguments that they are making now to the Second\nCircuit. The Second Circuit could have determined\nwhether vacatur and remand was appropriate during\nthe appeal, \n[p.15] \nbut they didn\u2019t do that. So it\u2019s simply too late. \nI guess my final point, Your Honor, is if one were to\naccept that there was a change in the law, in the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s opinion, which, I should point out,\naffirmed this Court\u2019s decision dismissing the case, then\nessentially you are opening the door to this kind of\npost-appeal amendment whenever the circuit affirms\nthe dismissal of a complaint on somewhat different\nreasoning than was used by the district Court. We\nsubmit that there is absolutely nothing in 60(b) that\nsuggests that that would be appropriate. \nTHE COURT: Thank you. I guess my question is\nthis. I am wondering if the parties want to treat their\npremotion conference letters as a fully briefed motion\nto vacate and to amend, because this case was filed in\n2019. Both parties have spent tremendous amounts of\ntime both drafting the complaint -- which, again, it\u2019s a\n\nApp. 149\nvery sympathetic set of facts, and it was very difficult\nto think about the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and sort of set\nthose very compelling facts to the side while we\nconsider the legal issues. \nBut now we have another complaint that is\nvoluminous, again, and it seems to me the legal issues\nare fairly straightforward. I\u2019m just very reluctant. \nI don\u2019t -- I tend to think here that defense are\ncorrect on a procedural ground on whether or not this\nliberal amendment casewise is really applicable in this\nsituation \n[p.16] \nhere, given the plaintiffs\u2019 litigation decisions, which\nthey probably now regret somewhat. \nMR. RADINE: Your Honor, this is Michael Radine.\nWe would, just to resort back, we think that the\nissue requires a little further briefing. I think it\u2019s more\ncomplicated. We did not have a chance to respond. \nOf course, there was no reply letter under Your\nHonor\u2019s rules, and we didn\u2019t get a chance to respond to\nsome of these arguments made by defendant, such as\nthat the law didn\u2019t change, which is definitely not\nright, or that we passed up an opportunity to amend\npost-judgment but pre-appeal, when the law of this\ncase would be that we would have to show acts or\nstatements by Blom employees, which we could not do\nthen and could not do now. \n\nApp. 150\nI think it\u2019s worth elaborating a little further in a\nbrief. We propose 15 pages for the parties and a short\nreply from plaintiffs to set this out. \nI don\u2019t think defendants have produced any case law\nsaying that this is procedurally improper. I understand\nthat they want out of this case, and I think we have\nvery compelling allegations that would be worrisome to\nthem; but, I think, in service to our clients, they should\nhave the opportunity to hear their case on the merits,\nand we would like the opportunity to brief that for the\nCourt. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Your Honor, if I might, Mr.\nRadine\u2019s \n[p.17] \ncomments reminded me of one point I had neglected to\nmake a moment ago, which is futility. \nContrary to what counsel just suggested, we are not\nat all concerned by the allegations raised in the\nproposed amended complaint. We think that they are\nfutile, that there are essentially no new allegations\nabout two of the alleged customers, Sanibal and Subul\nal-Khair. Essentially, plaintiffs have added a bunch of\npejorative adjectives to describe the cash withdrawals\nthat were already alleged at length in the dismissed\ncomplaint. \nWith respect to Union of Good, the third alleged\ncustomer, plaintiffs have backtracked that the\ncustomer was not in fact Union of Good, which is an\nentity \nthat \nwas \ndesignated \nby \nthe \nTreasury\nDepartment in 2008, but it was in fact a different\n\nApp. 151\nentity that was the Blom customer, an entity called the\nZakat Fund; and there is no allegation that the Zakat\nFund was ever designated by the Treasury Department\nand there is no allegation in the proposed amended\ncomplaint that there was any publicly available\ninformation linking the Zakat Fund to Hamas at the\ntime that Blom provided, allegedly provided banking\nservices to it. Nor were there any allegations about\nwhat those banking services consisted of. \nSo, contrary to counsel\u2019s suggestion, but we are not\nat all concerned about the amendments. We think it\nwould be futile, and that would be a separate ground\nfor denying the \n[p.18] \nmotion. \nMR. RADINE: Sorry. This is Michael Radine. Sorry\nfor jumping in there. \nI think the mischaracterization of our allegations is\nall that was, and is all the more reason to brief this out\nthoroughly. \nWe specifically answered the Second Circuit\u2019s\nquestions about whether Blom would have investigated\nthe recipients to who the transactions were coming\nfrom; that the Israeli designations of those entities\nwere publicized in the press; and that their own due\ndiligence procedures would have noticed the unusual\nconduct of a nonprofit organization, its large cash\nwithdrawals. \n\nApp. 152\nThe Zakat committee, obviously, was wrong too. The\nZakat Committee\u2019s website showed a picture of Sheikh\nYassin, the leader of Hamas, and many, many\nstatements about how they supply money to support\nthe Palestinian jihad from their Blom account to\nliberate Palestine from the American Jew, so on, so\nforth, on their website. \nIt\u2019s this topic and the misconstrual of it that, we\nthink, speaks all the more to the fact that this should\nbe briefed properly. \nTHE COURT: Well, sir, did you raise arguments\nabout a legal standard that you didn\u2019t raise before me\nin the district court? I\u2019m just not familiar with your\nbriefing in \n[p.19] \nthe circuit; but I just have a hard time accepting your\nstatement that you decided that the fact that you are\nnow proffering would have been futile because you\nthought the standard was -- you accepted a certain\nstandard, but, as a lawyer, both in the district court\nand the circuit, did you raise a whole panoply of\nstandards and did you make arguments on the law to\nthe circuit that you didn\u2019t make before me? \nMR. RADINE: I don\u2019t think so, Your Honor. I\u2019m not\nsure if I fully understand it, but we argued before -- I\nmean, our argument has been that the Halberstam\nforeseeability standard governs general awareness;\nthat knowledge, that I believe I said during oral\nargument, that knowledge could be inferred from\npublicly available sources as opposed to having to show\na bank\u2019s specific knowledge of a fact. \n\nApp. 153\nI think we have been consistent in our arguments,\nand we certainly thought our complaint covered those\nbases. \nKaplan was discussed. It had just come out in a\nlower court decision after briefing but before oral\nargument; and I believe I said in oral argument that\nthe Kaplan standard was incorrect; but, when it was\nadopted in this Court\u2019s decision, it took on the\nknowledge standard from the lower court in Kaplan\nthat we could not have met. We couldn\u2019t meet it now,\nagain. \nI don\u2019t have allegations about what Blom Bank saw.\nThis Kaplan case includes the due diligence allegations\nthat \n[p.20] \nwe have included in our complaint. Those were rejected\nin Kaplan as well. It would have been an unmeetable\nstandard. \nAs I mentioned before, we thought and believed\nuntil the Second Circuit corrected us that our\ncomplaint met the correct standard. The Second Circuit\ndisagreed as to specific allegations. \nThe ones I mention now are ones that relate to\nspecific deficiencies that the Second Circuit noted, as in\nthe Second Circuit found it was a close call as opposed\nto, again, rejecting our theory of knowledge, it found\nspecific problems that we can correct; and that is the\nrole of post-dismissal amendment, is to correct specific\nfactual problems. We have those now, after the Second\nCircuit decision, and should be able to correct them.\n\nApp. 154\nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Again, Your Honor, if there were\nadditional facts that counsel wanted to proffer, that the\ntime to do that would have either been at the initial\nconference, at the oral argument, after this Court\nissued its opinion, or before the Second Circuit. It\u2019s\nsimply hindsight is 20/20. \nTo say that it was -- it would have been futile to\nraise those points then because the first two times this\nCourt had not articulated any standard, and then when\nthis Court did articulate a standard it made it clear\nthat the key issue was public availability of\ninformation at the time the services \n[p.21] \nwere provided, which the Second Circuit affirmed was\ncorrect. \nSo, that was an issue on the appeal, and it was an\nissue before, in the briefing before Your Honor. So it\ndid not come out of the blue. It was not an\nunanticipated issue. \nIt was one of many, many defects that were briefed\nin the original complaint, and the fact that the Court of\nAppeals disagreed with this Court on whether there\nneeded to be knowledge or demonstration of knowledge\nby Blom is really irrelevant to that more fundamental\ndefect, that there was no contemporaneous public\ninformation from which general awareness could be\ninferred. \n\nApp. 155\nSo, respectfully, the argument that amendments\nwould have been futile before is really smoke and\nmirrors. \nTHE COURT: All right. Does plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nhave anything else to say? \nMR. RADINE: No, Your Honor. \nObviously, we felt that we had and wanted to\nrecount for the Court, but we made our publicly\navailable allegations before, which is to say we didn\u2019t\nthink we didn\u2019t need them, obviously. And then, in\nterms of what defendant wrote in their premotion\nletter for motion to dismiss, we didn\u2019t feel the need to\nchange that, certainly not after the decision in this case\nbut only upon the appeal when the standard was\nchanged. \nWe think that this is worth, given this unusual\n[p.22] \nsituation, briefing this issue. Again, we propose a\n15-page brief for us, for them, and then a short reply\nfrom us to give the Court everything, if Your Honor\nneeds analysis. \nTHE COURT: Just let me issue a vacatur, you\nwanted to speak to that. We are not going to go into the\namendment, because I think we should take it one step\nat a time. \nDo you agree? \nMR. RADINE: That\u2019s fine with us, Your Honor.\n\nApp. 156\nTHE COURT: Is it all right with you, Ms. Goldstein,\non behalf of the defendant? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: So I\u2019m not sure I want 15 pages as a\nlimit, just because there is a lot of procedural history\nhere. I think Ms. Goldstein\u2019s timeline was very helpful\nthat she just laid out. Laying that out may take a lot of\npages, but. \nI\u2019m happy to hear from the -- we can do it one of two\nways. We could either have simultaneous submissions\nand then simultaneous responses, so we don\u2019t have\nthree sets of papers. That would be my preference. \nOr, we can just do it in the traditional way. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: I would be happy to do the first\nalternative, Your Honor, simultaneous submissions\nand simultaneous responses. \nTHE COURT: I mean, that way everybody gets\nwhat they would feel is the last word to their\nopponent\u2019s \n[p.23] \nsubmissions. Doesn\u2019t that make sense? \nMR. RADINE: Your Honor, this is Michael Radine.\nOf course, we prefer the traditional three-brief\nstructure. \nI this it\u2019s important that everything is characterized\ncorrectly. I think that structure -- I don\u2019t want to\n\nApp. 157\ndisagree with the Court on what benefits it, but I think\nit\u2019s the more fair to use the normal structure on this.\nTHE COURT: Respectfully, I think you have had a\nlot of opportunity to present your arguments; and I\nthink this way you can lay out your best arguments for\nvacating the judgment, and you will have an\nopportunity to respond to the defendant\u2019s opposition to\nthat request. \nI think we can get to the point where we can\nhopefully decide this sooner rather than later. \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: If I might, Your Honor. \nI guess the implied premise of structuring things\nthis way is that if the Court were to grant the motion\nfor vacatur we would then have a separate set of\nbriefings on whether amendment was appropriate.\nTHE COURT: Yes. \nMR. RADINE: Okay. So plaintiffs certainly\nappreciate the preference of the Court for simultaneous\nbriefings. I understood it a set of briefs due on the same\nday, and then at some point after that a set of\nresponsive \n[p.24] \nbriefs due from both parties on the same day. \nTHE COURT: Yes. That way everyone will have an\nopportunity to respond to their opponent\u2019s argument;\nand it would be helpful for me to get that response and\nto understand the argument that you want to make\nbased on the law and the record. \n\nApp. 158\nMR. RADINE: Okay, Your Honor. Sure. We are\nhappy to do that. \nTHE COURT: All right. Ms. Goldstein, did you have\n-- you sounded a little hesitant or maybe concerned.\nDid you want to do all the briefing on both? \nMS. GOLDSTEIN: No, no. I just wanted to make\nsure that I wasn\u2019t waiving anything, but I\u2019m fine\nproceeding in this way, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: I think we should. I think it makes\nsense to do it this way because if I grant the motion,\nthen there will be a second set of motions regarding\nwhether or not it\u2019s appropriate to grant the plaintiffs\u2019\nrequest to amend. \nIf I deny the motion to vacate the judgment, then\nthat\u2019s the end of it and nobody will have to brief the\namendment. \nSo let\u2019s talk about scheduling.

The United\nStates District Court for the Western District of New\nYork (Siragusa, J.) construed plaintiffs\u2019 motion as\narising under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1)\nand denied the motion as untimely per the applicable\n\nApp. 162\none-year filing window. The court held in the\nalternative \nthat \nplaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion \nfails \nunder\nRule 60(b)(6), which does not have a strict time limit,\nbut which requires a showing of extraordinary\ncircumstances to merit relief from judgment. For the\nreasons \nexplained \nherein, \nwe \nconclude \nthat\nRule 60(b)(1) is inapplicable, and the unique facts of\nthis case necessitate post-judgment relief under\nRule 60(b)(6). Accordingly, we REVERSE the denial of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the judgment of dismissal\nand for leave to file a first amended complaint, and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. \nJudge Sullivan dissents in a separate opinion.\n ____________________ \nCHRISTOPHER MCNERNEY (Ossai Miazad,\non the brief), Outten & Golden LLP, New\nYork, NY, and TIFFANI BURGESS (Samuel\nSpital and Rachel M. Kleinman, on the\nbrief), \nNAACP \nLegal \nDefense \n&\nEducational Fund, Inc., New York, NY,\nfor Plaintiffs-Appellants.\nJACQUELINE \nP. \nPOLITO \n(Abigail \nL.\nGiarrusso, \non \nthe \nbrief), \nLittler\nMendelson, P.C., Fairport, NY, for\nDefendant-Appellee. \nDENNIS JACOBS, Circuit Judge: \nThe appeal in this Title VII suit challenges the\ndenial of a motion to vacate the judgment of dismissal\nand to file a first amended complaint. After the\ncomplaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim,\n\nApp. 163\nplaintiffs pursued a hotly contested appeal, which\nresulted in a split panel decision in this Court\naffirming the dismissal, and an in banc petition that\nwas ultimately denied over the dissent of five judges.\nPlaintiffs then asked the district court to vacate the\njudgment of dismissal so they could (attempt to) cure\nthe pleading deficiencies. \nConstruing plaintiffs\u2019 vacatur request as arising\nfrom their own \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or\nexcusable neglect\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b)(1), the district court denied the\nmotion\u2014brought twenty months after entry of the\njudgment of dismissal\u2014as untimely under the one-year\nfiling window that governs Rule 60(b)(1). The court\nheld in the alternative that under Rule 60(b)(6), which\nrequires only that the motion be brought within a\nreasonable time, no extraordinary circumstances\nentitle plaintiffs to relief from judgment. \nOn appeal, plaintiffs argue that their motion falls\noutside the scope of Rule 60(b)(1) and instead must be\nanalyzed under the catchall provision of Rule 60(b)(6).\nPlaintiffs further contend that this case is among the\nfew that justifies relief from final judgment under\n60(b)(6), and the district court exceeded the bounds of\nits discretion in concluding otherwise. We agree on\nboth counts. \nBACKGROUND \nI \nIn 2017, George Mandala and Charles Barnett\n(\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) applied for jobs at NTT Data, Inc. (\u201cNTT\u201d),\none of the world\u2019s largest information technology\n\nApp. 164\nservice providers. Mandala applied to be a salesforce\ndeveloper and was hired after his last round of\ninterviews. Upon accepting NTT\u2019s offer, Mandala\nauthorized the company to run a routine background\ncheck. A week later, a representative from NTT\ninformed Mandala that the company had a policy\nagainst hiring individuals with a felony conviction. A\nletter followed, withdrawing his job offer. Mandala\nthen filed a Charge of Discrimination with the U.S.\nEqual \nEmployment \nOpportunity \nCommission\n(\u201cEEOC\u201d), and a year later, in May 2018, the EEOC\nissued Mandala a Notice of Right to Sue. \nCharles Barnett had a similar experience. In\nJuly 2017, NTT contacted Barnett regarding an\nopportunity to contract as a web developer for the\nCommonwealth of Kentucky. Barnett, who had an\nassociates degree and a masters in the field of\ncomputer science, had previously worked for the\nCommonwealth of Kentucky as an administrative\nspecialist performing IT and other services. He applied\nfor the role with NTT, was offered the position, and\naccepted. Barnett then authorized NTT to run a\nbackground check. As with Mandala, NTT withdrew\nBarnett\u2019s offer of employment when the check turned\nup a prior conviction. Barnett tried to apply for other\ncontracting positions overseen by NTT, but the\ncompany informed him that it would not consider his\napplications. \nII \nIn August 2018, Mandala and Barnett filed a\nputative class action against NTT, asserting a claim of\ndisparate impact discrimination under Title VII of the\n\nApp. 165\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 2000e et seq., as\nwell as state law claims under New York\u2019s human\nrights and general business laws. \nThe gist of the Title VII claim is that NTT\u2019s blanket\npractice of refusing to employ people with felony\nconvictions disproportionately harms Black applicants\nbecause Black people are arrested and incarcerated at\nhigher rates than others. The Complaint cites reports\nby the Department of Justice, Census Bureau, and\nEEOC, and it references studies showing that: Black\npeople who made up 13% of the U.S. population in 2010\nconstituted 40% of the U.S. prison population at that\ntime; that an estimated one out of every three Black\nmales born today will go to prison, compared to just one\nout of every seventeen white males; and that Black\napplicants \nwith \ncriminal \nrecords \nare \nmore\ndisadvantaged in the job market as compared to other\napplicants. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52\u201354. \nThe United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of New York (Siragusa, J.) dismissed the\nComplaint for failure to state a claim of disparate\nimpact under Title VII, presumably with prejudice.1\nSee Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc. (\u201cMandala I\u201d), No. 18-\nCV-6591, 2019 WL 3237361, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. July 18,\n2019). The court discounted the \u201cgeneral statistics\u201d\ncited in the Complaint as \u201cinadequate to show\u201d a\n1 Neither the opinion nor the judgment expressly stated that the\ndismissal was with prejudice. However, that is the relief NTT\nsought in its motion to dismiss, and the court granted the motion\nin its entirety, and then directed the clerk\u2019s office to enter\njudgment for NTT and close the case. The court also declined to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. \n\nApp. 166\n\u201cstatistical disparity in the numbers of African-\nAmericans arrested and convicted of crimes in\nproportion to their representative numbers in the pool\nof qualified applicants for [NTT\u2019s] positions.\u201d Id. at\n*3\u20134 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs timely appealed. \nA split panel of this Court affirmed. See Mandala v.\nNTT Data, Inc. (\u201cMandala II\u201d), 975 F.3d 202 (2d Cir.\n2020). The majority agreed with the district court that\n\u201cthe statistical analysis [set forth in the Complaint]\u201d\ndid not \u201cfocus on the disparity between appropriate\ncomparator groups,\u201d id. at 210 (citing Wards Cove\nPacking Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 651 (1989))\u2014i.e.,\nindividuals who possess the necessary \u201ceducational and\ntechnical qualifications to work at NTT,\u201d id. at 212.\nRecognizing, however, that such granular data may be\nimpossible to collect without discovery, the majority\nsuggested that the Complaint might have survived\ndismissal if it had contained allegations explaining\n\u201cwhy their chosen national statistics are in fact likely\nto be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified applicant pool.\u201d\nId. at 212. The dissent countered that \u201cthe national\nstatistics and other facts alleged by [P]laintiffs were\nsufficient\u201d to withstand a motion to dismiss a disparate\nimpact claim; and that the district court (and the\nmajority) erroneously held the Complaint to the higher\nstandards for proving such a claim. Id. at 215 (Chin, J.,\ndissenting). \nPlaintiffs\u2019 subsequent petition for rehearing in banc\nwas denied, eliciting opinions both in support and in\n\nApp. 167\nopposition to rehearing.2 See Mandala v. NTT Data,\nInc. (\u201cMandala III\u201d), 988 F.3d 664 (Mem.) (2d Cir.\n2021). Several of the opinions referenced an amicus\nbrief in support of rehearing filed by a group of\ncriminology and sociology professors, which identified\na study suggesting that racial disparities in the rates\nof imprisonment persist as education levels rise. See\nBr. for Megan C. Kurlychek et al. as Amici Curiae\nSupporting Appellants at 8\u20139, Mandala III, 988 F.3d\n664 (No. 19-2308). Judges opposing rehearing in banc\nacknowledged that the amici\u2019s data \u201cmight have\nrendered Plaintiffs\u2019 claims plausible,\u201d but pointed out\nthat the study predated the filing of the Complaint and\nwas publicly available, so Plaintiffs could have cited it.\nMandala III, 988 F.3d at 668 (Sullivan and Nardini,\nJJ., concurring in the order denying rehearing in banc).\nOne dissenting opinion, signed by four judges,\nencouraged Plaintiffs to seek vacatur and leave to file\nan amended complaint. Id. at 671 (Pooler, J., dissenting\nfrom the order denying rehearing in banc). That is\nwhat Plaintiffs did. \nIn March 2021, just a few weeks after in banc\nrehearing was denied, Plaintiffs moved the district\ncourt to vacate the judgment dismissing the Complaint\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and for\nleave to file a first amended complaint under Rule 15.3\n2 Five judges concurred by opinion in the denial of rehearing; five\njudges dissented by other opinions.\n3 As a matter of procedure, \u201c[a] party seeking to file an amended\ncomplaint post[-]judgment must first have the judgment vacated\nor set aside pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or 60(b).\u201d Ruotolo v.\nCity of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation\n\nApp. 168\nPlaintiffs sought vacatur under Rule 60(b)(6). The\ndistrict court, however, viewed the motion as being\n\u201cpremised on their own mistake, inadvertence, and\nneglect\u201d\u2014the specific grounds listed in Rule 60(b)(1).\nMandala v. NTT Data, Inc. (\u201cMandala IV\u201d), No. 18-CV-\n6591, 2021 WL 5771154, at *5 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2021);\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). This distinction is crucial:\nwhile a 60(b)(1) motion to vacate must be filed within\none year of entry of the judgment, a 60(b)(6) motion\nneed only be made within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(c)(1). Noting that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion came one\nyear and eight months after the judgment of dismissal\nwas entered, the district court denied it as untimely\nunder Rule 60(b)(1). Mandala IV, 2021 WL 5771154, at\n*5. The court further held that, even if considered\nunder Rule 60(b)(6), the motion would fail on the\nmerits. Id. at *5\u20136. Plaintiffs challenge both rulings on\nappeal. \nDISCUSSION \n\u201cA denial of a motion to vacate a judgment under\nRule 60(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion,\u201d Ruotolo,\n514 F.3d at 191 (citation omitted), as is a \u201cdistrict\ncourt\u2019s denial of a post-judgment motion for leave to\nreplead,\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle Mexican Grill,\nInc., 970 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2020) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cUnder this\nstandard, we must affirm the . . . denial of vacatur,\nomitted). Rule 60(b) contains six subsections: (1)-(5) identify\nspecific grounds for reopening a judgment, and (6) is a catchall\nprovision for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 60(b). \n\nApp. 169\nunless the ruling is based on an erroneous view of the\nlaw or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the\nevidence.\u201d Rodriguez v. Mitchell, 252 F.3d 191, 200 (2d\nCir. 2001) (internal quotation marks, citation, and\nalteration omitted). On the facts of this case, we\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in\nanalyzing Plaintiffs\u2019 vacatur motion under Rule\n60(b)(1), and in denying Plaintiffs relief from final\njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6). \nI \n\u201cRule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(b)(6) are \u2018mutually\nexclusive,\u2019 such \u2018that any conduct which generally falls\nunder the former cannot stand as a ground for relief\nunder the latter.\u2019\u201d Stevens v. Miller, 676 F.3d 62, 67 (2d\nCir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Cirami, 535 F.2d\n736, 740 (2d Cir. 1976)). Thus, \u201c[w]here a party\u2019s Rule\n60(b) motion is premised on grounds fairly classified as\nmistake, inadvertence, or neglect, relief under Rule\n60(b)(6) is foreclosed.\u201d Id. (citing Klapprott v. United\nStates, \n335 \nU.S. \n601, \n614 \n(1949)). \nProper\ncharacterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion is a\nthreshold issue because, as previously explained, the\ntwo provisions are subject to different filing limitations:\nRule 60(b)(1) has a one-year window that runs from the\nentry of judgment; Rule 60(b)(6) requires only that the\nmotion be brought within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(c)(1). \nThe district court construed Plaintiffs\u2019 vacatur\nmotion \nas \n\u201cpremised \non \ntheir \nown \nmistake,\ninadvertence, and neglect\u201d because their Complaint\n\u201cdid not meet a well-settled standard.\u201d Mandala IV,\n2021 WL 5771154, at *5. Although the Complaint was\n\nApp. 170\nfound to have failed to state a claim, insufficient\npleading is not categorically a \u201cmistake,\u201d and Plaintiffs\u2019\nbelief that their Complaint satisfied the standards for\npleading a disparate impact claim was well-founded,\neven if ultimately erroneous. \nTo \nstart, \nthe \nground \nfor \ndismissing \nthe\nComplaint\u2014that racial disparities in national arrest\nand incarceration rates do not necessarily persist\namong persons with the skill set required for the jobs\nin question\u2014is not self-evident. Skills are acquired by\nadults; nobody is born with a resume. Every qualified\ncandidate for employment was once a kid, youngster,\nand teenager. Plaintiffs reasonably could have assumed\nthat they need not allege the persistence of disparate\npatterns of arrest and conviction among people seeking\nskilled employment, because even skilled persons are\nassumed \nto \nhave \nlived \nlife \nbefore \nbecoming\ncredentialed. \nPlaintiffs likewise could have assumed that they did\nnot need to search out and plead a study to that effect,\nbecause it is abnormal to require the pleading of\nevidence in a complaint. See Arista Records LLC v.\nDoe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2010) (stating\nplausibility \u201csimply calls for enough fact to raise a\nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of illegality\u201d) (alteration omitted) (quoting\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007));\nDeravin v. Kerik, 335 F.3d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 2003)\n(\u201c[T]his Court has repeatedly warned that the pleading\nrequirements in discrimination cases are very lenient,\neven de minimis.\u201d (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)); Gordon v. City of New York, No. 14\n\nApp. 171\nCiv. 6115, 2016 WL 4618969, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2,\n2016) (\u201cA plaintiff need not plead facts sufficient to\nestablish a prima facie case in his complaint in order to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss.\u201d (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)); see also Adkins v. Morgan\nStanley, No. 12 Civ. 7667, 2013 WL 3835198, at *10\n(S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2013) (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations . . . are\nsufficient to give notice to [defendant] of[ ]a plausible\nclaim of disparate impact. Whether those statistics\nmay prove insufficient at a later date is not now a\nquestion before this court.\u201d); Jenkins v. N.Y.C. Transit\nAuth., 646 F. Supp. 2d 464, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (\u201cIt\nwould be inappropriate to require a plaintiff to produce\nstatistics to support her disparate impact claim before\nthe plaintiff has had the benefit of discovery.\u201d (citation\nomitted)). \nMoreover, as far as we can tell, no Second Circuit\ncase decided prior to Plaintiffs\u2019 suit had applied the\nstandard requiring granular statistical comparators at\nthe pleading stage of a Title VII disparate impact suit.\nIt appears that every Supreme Court and Second\nCircuit case discussing the subject had been decided\nafter discovery or even after trial.4 \n4 See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989)\n(bench trial); Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 648 (bench trial); Dothard\nv. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977) (three-judge bench trial);\nHazelwood Sch. Dist. v.

Potter, 320 F.3d 321 (2d Cir. 2003) (summary judgment);\n\nApp. 172\nAnd when this Court was called upon to review the\nsufficiency of the Complaint, our decision affirming\ndismissal elicited a vigorous dissent, which argued,\namong other things, that \u201cthe national statistics and\nother facts alleged by [P]laintiffs were sufficient . . . to\nmeet [the] minimal burden\u201d of pleading a disparate\nimpact claim. Mandala II, 975 F.3d at 215 (Chin, J.,\ndissenting). The denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for\nrehearing in banc was also closely contested, with five\njudges of this Court arguing in favor of rehearing. See\nMandala III, 988 F.3d at 664. \nThe circumstances distinguish this case from the\ntypical Rule 60(b)(1) cases, which characteristically\ninvolve mistakes that amount to a fumble. See, e.g.,\nMiller, 676 F.3d at 65, 68 (government let its time to\nappeal expire due to failure to check docket); Warren v.\nGarvin, 219 F.3d 111, 114\u201315 (2d Cir. 2000) (plaintiff\nfailed to raise claim within statute of limitations\nwindow due to neglect); see also Arrieta v. Battaglia,\n461 F.3d 861, 864\u201365 (7th Cir. 2006) (plaintiff\nvoluntarily moved to dismiss an action that then could\nnot be refiled due to the expiration of the statute of\nlimitations). Plaintiffs\u2019 decision to stand by a pleading\ndeemed to be sufficient by several judges of this Court\ncannot seriously be considered a mistake within the\nmeaning of Rule 60(b)(1). \nGuardians Ass\u2019n of N.Y.C. Police Dep\u2019t, Inc. v. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n\nof City of N.Y., 630 F.2d 79 (2d Cir. 1980) (bench trial); Jones v.\nN.Y.C. Human Res. Admin., 528 F.2d 696 (2d Cir. 1976) (bench\ntrial).\n\nApp. 173\nFinally, even if we were to accept the district court\u2019s\nview that Plaintiffs\u2019 vacatur motion arises from a legal\nmistake based on insufficient pleading, Rule 60(b)(1)\nwould be inapplicable. When post-judgment relief is\nsought for the purpose of curing a pleading deficiency,\nthis Court typically applies Rule 60(b)(6) to consider\nwhether the circumstances warrant vacatur. See, e.g.,\nInd. Pub. Ret. Sys. v. SAIC, Inc., 818 F.3d 85, 92\u201393\n(2d Cir. 2016) (vacating in part denial of motion under\nRule 60(b)(6) where plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment to\nbolster securities claim would not have been futile);\nLeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2001)\n(vacating denial of motion under Rule 60(b)(6) where\nmovant sought amendment to drop non-diverse co-\nplaintiff); see also Strategic Cap. Dev. Grp., Ltd. v.\nSigma-Tau Pharms., Inc., Nos. 98-7144, 99-7364, 1999\nWL 973313, at *1 (2d Cir. Sept. 23, 1999) (unpublished)\n(vacating denial of vacatur motion under Rule 60(b)(6)\nwhere plaintiff sought first opportunity to replead soon\nafter entry of judgment). So, while some kinds of legal\nerror are properly analyzed under 60(b)(1), see, e.g.,\nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 62 (2d Cir. 1986)\n(plaintiff did not contemplate or understand the\nbreadth of his voluntary stipulation of dismissal), a\nvacatur motion that seeks to rectify a deficient\npleading warrants consideration of the circumstances\nunder 60(b)(6). \nWe therefore conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to\nvacate the judgment of dismissal in order to file a first\namended complaint cannot fairly be classified as falling\nwithin the scope of Rule 60(b)(1) rather than Rule\n60(b)(6). See United Airlines, Inc. v. Brien, 588 F.3d\n158, 176 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding vacatur motion \u201cis not\n\nApp. 174\neasily categorized as \u2018mistake\u2019 or \u2018inadvertence\u2019 under\nRule 60(b)(1), and it should therefore be allowed to\nproceed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u201d). The district court thus\nclearly erred in denying the motion as untimely under\nthe one-year limit of 60(b)(1).\nII \nA \nRule 60(b)(6) \u201cgrants federal courts broad authority\nto relieve a party from a final judgment upon such\nterms as are just, provided that the motion is made\nwithin a reasonable time and is not premised on one of\nthe grounds for relief enumerated in clauses (b)(1)\nthrough (b)(5).\u201d Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition\nCorp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). \u201c[I]t constitutes a grand\nreservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular\ncase.\u201d Matarese v.

United\nStates, 340 U.S. 193 (1950)). \nWhen vacatur is sought in order to obtain leave to\nfile an amended complaint, special considerations come\ninto play. See Williams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208,\n212 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam). \u201cIn the ordinary\ncourse, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide\nthat courts \u2018should freely give leave\u2019 to amend a\ncomplaint \u2018when justice so requires.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)). \u201cWhere, however, a party does not\n\nApp. 175\nseek leave to file an amended complaint until after\njudgment is entered, Rule 15\u2019s liberality must be\ntempered by considerations of finality.\u201d Id. at 213. So,\non a post-judgment motion for vacatur and leave to\namend, \u201cdue regard\u201d must be given to both the\n\u201cphilosophy favoring finality of judgments and the\nexpeditious termination of litigation,\u201d and the \u201cliberal\namendment policy of Rule 15(a).\u201d Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). After all, the\n\u201c\u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception\nto finality,\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 126 (2017)\n(quoting Gonzalez v.

See id. at 145\n(affirming denial of motion to file third amended\ncomplaint); see also Schwartz v. HSBC Bank USA,\nN.A., 750 F. App\u2019x 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary\norder) (affirming denial of motion to file third amended\ncomplaint); Smith v.

This makes sense: when\na plaintiff already had multiple chances to state a\nclaim, there is little risk of manifest injustice in\ndenying yet another go. See Metzler, 970 F.3d at 147\n\nApp. 176\n(\u201c[A] plaintiff afforded attempt after attempt . . . might\none day succeed in stating a claim[,] [b]ut the federal\nrules and policies behind them do not permit such\nlimitless possibility.\u201d). \nPlaintiffs here seek to file a first amended\ncomplaint. In that event, \u201cit is an abuse of discretion to\ndeny\u201d post-judgment relief, Metzler, 970 F.3d at 144,\n\u201cwithout any justifying reason,\u201d such as \u201cundue delay,\nbad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,\nrepeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments\npreviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing\nparty by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or]\nfutility of amendment,\u201d Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178,\n182 (1962).5 \nB \nIn denying the vacatur motion, the district court\n\u201capplied \na \nstandard \nthat \noveremphasized\nconsiderations of finality at the expense of the liberal\namendment policy embodied in the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure\u201d and this Court\u2019s \u201cstrong preference for\nresolving disputes on the merits.\u201d See Williams, 659\nF.3d at 210, 212\u201313 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). Prior to the filing of the vacatur\nmotion, Plaintiffs had neither requested nor been\nafforded a first opportunity to replead, and the district\ncourt had dismissed their Complaint under Rule\n5 The dissent argues that the district court did indeed provide a\n\u201cjustifying reason\u201d for denying leave to amend. In circular fashion,\nit identifies the \u201cjustifying reason\u201d for denying post-judgment relief\nas the failure to demonstrate adequate grounds for relief under\nRule 60. Q.E.D. \n\nApp. 177\n12(b)(6) with prejudice. Rather than weighing this\nposture as a factor that favors relief from judgment, the\ndistrict court faulted Plaintiffs for failing to seek such\nrelief earlier. The court reasoned that Plaintiffs were\non notice of the potential insufficiency of their\nallegations based on the arguments \u201craised both in\nNTT\u2019s motion papers and during oral argument\u201d on the\nmotion to dismiss, but Plaintiffs made a \u201cstrategic\ndecision\u201d \u201cto stand by their original complaint\u201d and\n\u201ctest the theory of law that they believed to be proper.\u201d\nMandala IV, 2021 WL 5771154, at *6\u20138. Second Circuit\nprecedent makes clear, however, that the failure to\nseek leave to amend pre-judgment, standing alone,\ndoes not constitute undue delay or otherwise justify\ndenying relief from judgment for a plaintiff seeking to\nfile a first amended complaint. See Williams, 659 F.3d\nat 214. \nIn Williams, the district court dismissed the original\ncomplaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim,\nand the plaintiff then filed a motion seeking relief\nunder Rules 60 and 15 to remedy the pleading defects\nidentified in the dismissal order. Id. at 211\u201312. The\nrequested relief was denied principally on the grounds\nthat the plaintiff failed to \u201cexplain why she should be\ngranted leave to replead at this stage when she failed\nto request an opportunity to replead in the first\ninstance.\u201d Id. at 212. On appeal, we ruled that the\ncourt\u2019s reasoning could not be reconciled with the\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Foman v. Davis. Id. at 214.\nAlthough the Foman plaintiff had not sought leave to\nfile an amended complaint prior to the district court\u2019s\nentry of judgment, the Supreme Court held that the\ndenial of the plaintiff\u2019s post-judgment motion to replead\n\nApp. 178\nlacked any \u201cjustifying reason\u201d and vacated the lower\ncourt\u2019s ruling. 371 U.S. at 182. Consistent with Foman,\nWilliams concluded that the denial of relief solely for\nfailure to seek amendment pre-judgment was \u201cnot a\nproper exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d 659\nF.3d at 214. \nThis Court has applied Williams and Foman in the\nRule 15 context to hold that, in the absence of a valid\nrationale like undue delay or futility, it is improper to\nsimultaneously dismiss a complaint with prejudice\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) and deny leave to amend when the\ndistrict court has not adequately informed the plaintiffs\nof its view of the complaint\u2019s deficiencies. See Loreley\nFin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, 797\nF.3d 160, 189\u201390 (2d Cir. 2015) (vacating denial of\nleave to amend); Cresci v. Mohawk Valley Cmty. Coll.,\n693 F. App\u2019x 21, 25 (2d Cir. 2017) (summary order)\n(reversing denial of leave to amend); see also Noto v.\n22nd Century Grp., Inc., 35 F.4th 95, 107 (2d Cir. 2022)\n(\u201c[T]his circuit strongly favors liberal grant of an\nopportunity to replead after dismissal of a complaint\nunder Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)); Attestor Value Master Fund v.\nRepublic of Argentina, 940 F.3d 825, 833 (2d Cir. 2019)\n(noting the Second Circuit has been \u201cparticularly\nskeptical of denials of requests to amend when a\nplaintiff did not previously have a district court\u2019s ruling\non a relevant issue\u201d); 421-A Tenants Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. 125\nCourt St. LLC, 760 F. App\u2019x 44, 51 (2d Cir. 2019)\n(summary order) (stating \u201cit is often improper to deny\nleave to amend\u201d when \u201cthe plaintiff lacks the benefit of\na ruling from the court\u201d (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)). \n\nApp. 179\nLoreley is instructive. There, at a pre-motion\nconference on the motion to dismiss, the district court\n\u201cpresented [the] [p]laintiffs with a Hobson\u2019s choice:\nagree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed and\ndecided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d 797 F.3d\nat 190. Solely because the plaintiffs opted not to amend\ntheir complaint at that point, the district court\nrendered its judgment of dismissal with prejudice. Id.\nOn appeal, we concluded that the court exceeded the\nbounds of discretion in denying plaintiffs an\nopportunity to amend: \u201c[w]ithout the benefit of a\nruling, many a plaintiff will not see the necessity of\namendment or be in a position to weigh the practicality\nand possible means of curing specific deficiencies.\u201d Id.\nThis is especially so when (as here) the \u201cpleading\ndefects\u201d are \u201cborderline, and hence subject to\nreasonable dispute.\u201d Id. at 191. We thus held that the\ncourt clearly erred by \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 decision to\nstand by the complaint after a preview of Defendants\u2019\narguments\u2014in the critical absence of a definitive\nruling\u2014as a forfeiture of the protections afforded by\nRule 15.\u201d Id. at 190. \nAs the foregoing cases demonstrate, Plaintiffs had\nno obligation to \u201cseek leave to replead . . . immediately\nupon answering the motion to dismiss the complaint\n(without yet knowing whether the court w[ould] grant\nthe motion, or, if so, on what ground) . . . .\u201d Williams,\n659 F.3d at 214. The district court thus erred in relying\non that procedural fact to justify denying Plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for vacatur and leave to amend. \nLikewise, Plaintiffs cannot be foreclosed from\nobtaining post-judgment relief solely because they\n\nApp. 180\nchose to appeal rather than seek vacatur immediately\nupon dismissal of their claim. True, in both Foman and\nWilliams, the plaintiff moved to vacate the judgment\ndirectly after the court\u2019s dismissal of the suit. But we\nhave found relief from judgment to be warranted in\ncases involving more circuitous paths. SAIC is one\nexample. There, the district court dismissed in part the\nfirst amended complaint and gave the plaintiffs leave\nto amend the dismissed claims. 818 F.3d at 91. The\nplaintiffs elected to forgo that option and to proceed\nwith their surviving claims. Id. On the defendant\u2019s\nmotion for reconsideration, the court reversed course\nand dismissed the complaint in full, with prejudice.\nOnly then did plaintiffs seek leave to amend their\ncomplaint. Id. The district court denied the requested\npost-judgment relief, and we reversed, holding the\nproposed amendments were not futile. Id. at 92\u201394. \nIn the same way, these Plaintiffs diligently\nprosecuted their case at all times. Given the wording of\nthe district court\u2019s opinion on the motion to dismiss,\nPlaintiffs could have reasonably believed that it would\nhave been impossible to cure the pleading deficiencies\nto the court\u2019s satisfaction without discovery. The\ndistrict court ruled that \u201cgeneral statistics are\ninadequate to show a relationship between the pool of\napplicants who are Caucasian versus African\nAmerican[] and their respective rates of felony\nconvictions,\u201d and \u201c[t]he statistics Plaintiffs cite in the\ncomplaint do not indicate whether the individuals in\nthe general population cited shared qualifications that\nwould make them viable candidates for either of the\npositions offered to Plaintiffs.\u201d Mandala I, 2019 WL\n3237361, at *3\u20134. The court gave no indication that\n\nApp. 181\nthis deficiency could be remedied through anything less\nthan data corresponding to the actual characteristics of\nNTT\u2019s employees\u2014information known only to NTT. \nIt wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on appeal that\nit became clear what other types of information might\nsuffice at the pleading stage. In affirming the district\ncourt\u2019s dismissal of the Complaint, we agreed that\nPlaintiffs failed to demonstrate \u201cthat the general\npopulation statistics on which they rely might\naccurately reflect NTT\u2019s pool of qualified job\napplicants.\u201d Mandala II, 975 F.3d at 211 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). But\nwe also acknowledged that \u201cPlaintiffs are undoubtedly\nworking from an informational disadvantage at this\nearly point in the proceedings.\u201d Id. at 212. Given that\nPlaintiffs lack \u201caccess to more granular data\u201d at the\npleading stage, we explained that they might instead\nbe able to state a claim for disparate impact by\n\u201cprovid[ing] additional allegations to explain why their\nchosen national statistics are in fact likely to be\nrepresentative of NTT\u2019s qualified applicant pool,\u201d or by\n\u201cidentify[ing] other publicly available information that\ncould plausibly support a Title VII claim.\u201d Id. \nPlaintiffs then timely filed a petition for rehearing\nin banc, requesting, in the alternative to reversal, that\nwe remand the case to permit Plaintiffs a first\nopportunity to seek leave to amend their Complaint.\nWhen, four months later, this Court denied rehearing,\nPlaintiffs promptly sought relief in the district court.\nAlthough Plaintiffs\u2019 vacatur motion ultimately came\none year and eight months after the judgment of\n\nApp. 182\ndismissal, the timing was reasonable given the\nprocedural history. \nFinally, there are no \u201cjustifying reason[s],\u201d Foman,\n371 U.S. at 182, for depriving Plaintiffs of the chance\nto obtain relief from judgment and file an amended\ncomplaint for the first time. There is no plausible\ncontention of bad faith or dilatory motive, nor that\nvacatur would unduly prejudice the Defendant. There\nwas no undue delay, for the reasons explained above.\nAnd the district court did not conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019\nproposed amendments would be futile. To the contrary,\nthe court acknowledged the relevance of the amici\u2019s\ndata indicating that racial disparities in criminal\noutcomes persist at higher levels of education, and\nnoted that in the in banc memoranda, several judges of\nthis Court \u201csuggested these statistics \u2018might\u2019 have\nrendered Plaintiffs\u2019 claims plausible had they been\nincluded in the original pleadings.\u201d Mandala IV, 2021\nWL 5771154, at *2 (quoting Mandala III, 988 F.3d at\n668). This is the sort of case in which it is \u201cappropriate\n. . . to take into account the nature of the proposed\namendment in deciding whether to vacate the\npreviously entered judgment.\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d at\n213 (quoting Ruotolo, 514 F.3d at 191). \nThe district court seemingly gave no weight to the\nviability of Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendment because it\nwas based on information that was publicly available\nfor years prior to the filing of the Complaint. Even\nassuming the information was obtainable, standing\nalone that is not a basis for depriving Plaintiffs of a\nfirst opportunity to add allegations that render their\nclaim plausible. As the Supreme Court has explained,\n\nApp. 183\nwhen \u201cthe underlying facts or circumstances relied\nupon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he\nought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on\nthe merits.\u201d Foman, 371 U.S. at 182; see also Branum\nv. Clark, 927 F.2d 698, 705 (2d Cir. 1991) (reversing\ndenial of pro se plaintiff\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, noting\ncourts \u201cshould not dismiss without granting leave to\namend at least once when a liberal reading of the\ncomplaint gives any indication that a valid claim might\nbe stated\u201d). \nIn sum, this is one of the exceptional cases\nnecessitating relief from judgment: Plaintiffs have yet\nto be afforded a single opportunity to amend their\npleading; the original dismissal of the Complaint was\npremised on grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and\nvigorous debate; Plaintiffs diligently prosecuted their\ncase at all times; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendments\naddress the sole pleading deficiency identified by the\ndistrict court. On these facts, the court\u2019s contrary\nholding was not a proper exercise of discretion.\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons we REVERSE the denial of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the judgment of dismissal\nand for leave to file a first amended complaint, and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. \nA True Copy \nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit\n/s/ Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe\n[SEAL]\n\nApp. 184\nRICHARD J. SULLIVAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nI dissent from the majority\u2019s decision because I\ncannot agree that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in concluding that Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b)(1), as opposed to Rule 60(b)(6), applies\nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the district court\u2019s\njudgment of dismissal. But even if it could be argued\nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case, I would still\naffirm because I agree with the district court that\nPlaintiffs \nfailed \nto \ndemonstrate \nextraordinary\ncircumstances warranting relief. For these reasons, I\nwould affirm the district court\u2019s order denying\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the judgment. \nAs an initial matter, I emphasize that the standard\nof review in this appeal is abuse of discretion. See\nExxonMobil Oil Corp. v. TIG Ins. Co., 44 F.4th 163, 172\n(2d Cir. 2022). A district court abuses its discretion\nonly when \u201cits decision [(1)] rests on an error of law or\na clearly erroneous factual finding; or (2) cannot be\nfound within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The relevant\ninquiry is therefore not whether Plaintiffs might have\n\u201creasonably . . . assumed that they need not allege\u201d\ncertain facts in their complaint in order to state a\nclaim, Maj. Op. at 11, but rather whether the district\ncourt\u2019s decision is erroneous or cannot be found within\nthe range of permissible decisions. Given this\ndeferential standard of review, I am hard pressed to\nsee how the district court\u2019s decision could constitute an\nabuse of discretion. \nIn my view, the district court did not err in\nconstruing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion as one for relief under\n\nApp. 185\nRule 60(b)(1) rather than Rule 60(b)(6). Recognizing\nthe concern that \u201cparties may attempt to use Rule\n60(b)(6) to circumvent the one-year time limitation in\nother subsections of Rule 60(b),\u201d we have long\nrecognized that \u201cRule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(b)(6) are\nmutually exclusive, such that any conduct which\ngenerally falls under the former cannot stand as a\nground for relief under the latter.\u201d Stevens v. Miller,\n676 F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cWhere a party\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is\npremised on grounds fairly classified as mistake,\ninadvertence, or neglect, relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is\nforeclosed.\u201d Id. at 67\u201368 (citing Klapprott v. United\nStates, 335 U.S. 601, 614 (1949)). \nIn their motion to vacate, Plaintiffs asserted that\nthe pleading standard \u201cfor relief under Title VII . . .\nwas \npreviously \nunclear,\u201d \nand \nthe \nsupposed\nclarifications set forth in the Court\u2019s opinions on appeal\nand in connection with the denial of en banc review\njustify vacatur of the district court\u2019s judgment. J. App\u2019x\nat 106\u201307. But in concurring with the denial of en banc\nreview, the majority of this Court\u2019s active members\nexplicitly rejected the contention that the Court\u2019s\ndecision on appeal, Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 975\nF.3d 202 (2d Cir. 2020), clarified or otherwise changed\nthe plausibility standard for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. See\nMandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 988 F.3d 664, 665 (2d Cir.\n2021) (Sullivan, J., and Nardini, J., concurring) (noting\nthat the panel majority opinion reflected \u201ca heartland\napplication of the plausibility pleading standard that\nhas been the law of this Circuit for more than a\ndecade\u201d). Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that these\nproceedings provided \u201cmuch-needed clarity\u201d regarding\n\nApp. 186\nthe requisite pleading standard, J. App\u2019x at 109; see\nalso id. at 96, 106\u201307, evinces a misunderstanding of\nour prior opinions in this case, as well as the well-\nestablished law of this Circuit, see Malave v. Potter, 320\nF.3d 321, 326 (2d Cir. 2003) (explaining that general\npopulation statistics are permissible only when such\nstatistics \u201caccurately reflect the pool of qualified job\napplicants\u201d for the positions in question (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); see also Vega v. Hempstead\nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 87 (2d Cir. 2015)\n(applying the plausibility standard to a Title VII\ndisparate-treatment claim); Littlejohn v. City of New\nYork, 795 F.3d 297, 310\u201311 (2d Cir. 2015) (same).\nPlaintiffs\u2019 mistaken understanding as to the law places\ntheir motion squarely within the ambit of Rule 60(b)(1).\nSee Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 62 (2d Cir. 1986)\n(explaining that \u201cwe have consistently declined to\nrelieve a client under [Rule 60(b)(1)] of the burdens of\na final judgment entered against him due to the\nmistake or omission of his attorney by reason of the\nlatter\u2019s ignorance of the law\u201d (emphasis added and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). As such, there can\nbe no dispute that the district court properly denied the\nmotion as untimely, since it was made more than a\nyear after the judgment was issued. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(c)(1); J. App\u2019x at 3 (docket reflecting judgment in\nfavor of NTT dated July 19, 2019, Dist. Ct. Doc. No. 28,\nand Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate judgment dated\nMarch 31, 2021, Dist. Ct. Doc. No. 35).1 \n1 The majority\u2019s contention that Rule 60(b)(6) is categorically\napplicable when \u201cpost[]judgment relief is sought for the purpose of\ncuring a pleading deficiency,\u201d Maj. Op. at 14, is mistaken. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., 642 F.3d 121, 125 (2d Cir.\n\nApp. 187\nBut even assuming that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion falls\nunder Rule 60(b)(6) and not Rule 60(b)(1), I still cannot\nsee how the district court abused its discretion in\nconcluding that Plaintiffs failed to articulate an\n\u201cextraordinary circumstance[] justifying relief.\u201d Metzler\nInv. Gmbh v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d\n133, 143 (2d Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). To the contrary, our precedents and the\nestablished facts in the record confirm that there are\nno extraordinary circumstances here. \nFirst, while discovery may be necessary in some\ncircumstances to identify viable comparators, that is\nnot the case here. As the majority acknowledges, see\nMaj. Op. at 7\u20138, and as the district court correctly\nnoted, the \u201cstatistics that Plaintiffs seek to add to their\ncomplaint to correct the deficiencies in their pleadings\nwere publicly available for nearly a decade prior to the\nfiling of the complaint,\u201d Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc.,\nNo. 18-cv-6591 (CJS), 2021 WL 5771154, at *8\n(W.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2021); see also Mandala, 988 F.3d at\n668 (Sullivan, J., and Nardini, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he\n2011) (affirming district court\u2019s order denying Rule 60(b)(1) motion\nto reconsider denial of request for leave to amend); Fed.

Brien, 588 F.3d 158 (2d Cir. 2009),\nlend support to the majority\u2019s position on this point, as that case\nnowhere suggests that postjudgment requests for leave to amend\n\u201ccannot fairly be classified as falling within the scope of Rule\n60(b)(1).\u201d Maj. Op. at 15; see also Brien, 588 F.3d at 176 (finding\nthat vacatur motions \u201cbased on the potential hardship resulting\nfrom inconsistent judgments\u201d are properly brought under Rule\n60(b)(6) because such claims are \u201cnot easily categorized as\n\u2018mistake\u2019 or \u2018inadvertence\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(1)\u201d). \n\nApp. 188\nvery figures that might have rendered Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\nplausible not only exist but also are publicly available;\nPlaintiffs simply failed to include them in their\npleadings.\u201d). Plaintiffs therefore cannot excuse their\ninadequate pleading on this basis. See E.E.O.C. v. Port\nAuth. of N.Y. & N.J., 768 F.3d 247, 258 (2d Cir. 2014)\n(noting that \u201cimprecise pleading is particularly\ninappropriate where the plaintiffs necessarily had\naccess, without discovery, to specific information from\nwhich to fashion a suitable complaint\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted)). \nSecond, even if we were to assume arguendo that\nthe Court\u2019s prior decisions on appeal somehow clarified\nthe requisite pleading standard for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims,\nthe district court still would have been justified in\nconcluding \nthat \nPlaintiffs \nfailed \nto \nidentify\nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief. \u201cAs a\ngeneral matter,\u201d even a \u201cchange in decisional law does\nnot constitute an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 for the\npurposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Tapper v. Hearn, 833 F.3d\n166, 172 (2d Cir. 2016) (emphasis added and internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted); see also\nStevens, 676 F.3d at 68\u201369. It is therefore difficult to\nsee how a mere clarification of decisional law would\nconstitute an extraordinary circumstance here.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument \u2013 that the district\ncourt announced a per se rule that \u201c\u2018general\u2019 or national\nstatistics were . . . \u2018inadequate\u2019 to show disparate\nimpact,\u201d thereby depriving Plaintiffs of any \u201cway\nforward\u201d in their case, Plaintiffs\u2019 Br. at 8, 18 \u2013 is of no\nmoment, since Plaintiffs themselves recognize that this\nCourt never adopted such a per se rule and, in fact,\n\nApp. 189\ndescribed several ways in which Plaintiffs might meet\ntheir pleading burden using national statistics, id. at 8;\nsee also Maj. Op. at 24 (recognizing that the Court\u2019s\ndecision on appeal made \u201cclear what other types of\ninformation might suffice at the pleading stage\u201d).\nRather than seek vacatur and leave to amend at that\njuncture, Plaintiffs instead opted to file a petition for\nrehearing en banc \u2013 a strategic choice that plainly\nundermines any argument that some aspect of the\ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \norder \nwas \nan \n\u201cextraordinary\ncircumstance\u201d preventing Plaintiffs from pursuing\ntheir claims. \nIndeed, the record in this case reflects that\nPlaintiffs made a conscious and informed choice to\npursue a particular litigation strategy. Plaintiffs were\nrepeatedly apprised \u2013 in NTT\u2019s motion to dismiss, at\noral argument on NTT\u2019s motion, and in the district\ncourt\u2019s order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint \u2013 of the\nprecise pleading defect that Plaintiffs now seek to\nremedy. See J. App\u2019x at 36\u201337, 172\u201373; Mandala v.\nNTT Data, Inc., No. 18-cv-6591 (CJS), 2019 WL\n3237361, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. July 18, 2019). Rather than\nseek leave to amend at any prior stage, Plaintiffs stood\nby their pleading and opted to press for a lower\npleading standard on appeal. When that too proved\nunsuccessful, Plaintiffs doubled down on their strategy\nby filing an en banc petition instead of a motion to\namend. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that, absent the requested\nrelief, the district court\u2019s judgment will subject\nPlaintiffs \nto \n\u201cextreme \nhardship\u201d \nis \ntherefore\nunpersuasive. Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 4. Because Plaintiffs\n\u201cmade a conscious and informed choice of litigation\nstrategy,\u201d they cannot \u201cin hindsight seek extraordinary\n\nApp. 190\nrelief\u201d when their preferred strategy failed. United\nStates v. Bank of N.Y., 14 F.3d 756, 759 (2d Cir. 1994).\nThird, the fact that Plaintiffs believe they are now\nable to effectively plead their claims does not mean\nthat the district court abused its discretion in declining\nto vacate its prior judgment. We have held that a\ndistrict court may not grant a postjudgment motion for\nleave to amend without first identifying \u201ca valid basis\nto vacate the previously entered judgment.\u201d Metzler,\n970 F.3d at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that we have a \u201cstrong\npreference for resolving disputes on the merits,\u201d\nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 212\u201313 (2d\nCir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), it is\nequally true that the viability of a party\u2019s proffered\namended pleading alone is an insufficient basis on\nwhich to grant Rule 60(b) relief, see Metzler, 970 F.3d\nat 142. The majority\u2019s decision thus undermines the\nprinciple that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an\nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such\nrelief is available in the ordinary course. See Ruotolo v.\nCity of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2008)\n(noting that Rule 60(b) provides a \u201cmechanism for\nextraordinary judicial relief\u201d that can be invoked only\nupon a showing of exceptional circumstances (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Motorola Credit Corp. v.\nUzan, 561 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2009) (same);\nNemaizer, 793 F.2d at 61 (explaining that Rule 60(b)\n\u201callows extraordinary judicial relief\u201d). \nContrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the district\ncourt did not deny Plaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to amend\n\u201cwithout any justifying reason.\u201d Maj. Op. at 18\n\nApp. 191\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The district court\nplainly denied Plaintiffs the opportunity to file an\namended \ncomplaint \nbecause \nthey \n\u201cfailed \nto\ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief from the\n[c]ourt\u2019s judgment under Rule 60.\u201d2 Mandala, 2021 WL\n5771154, at *4. The district court therefore did not\nneed to additionally identify any \u201cundue delay, bad\nfaith or dilatory motive on the part of [Plaintiffs],\nrepeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments\npreviously allowed, undue prejudice to [NTT] by virtue\nof allowance of the amendment, or futility of\namendment,\u201d Maj. Op. at 18 (internal quotation marks\nand alterations omitted), in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\nSee Metzler, 970 F.3d at 142\u201346 (rejecting the\nargument that the aforementioned standard applicable\nto pretrial motions for leave to amend pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) is the\ngoverning \nstandard \nfor \nsuch \nmotions \nin \nthe\npostjudgment context). \nThe majority\u2019s reliance on Williams v. Citigroup Inc.\nis misplaced. Williams \u2013 which merely held that a\ndistrict court may not deny a request for leave to\namend solely on the basis that a plaintiff failed to\nrequest leave to replead before judgment was entered\n\u2013 does not stand for the proposition that a party who\nmade a calculated decision to forgo seeking leave to\n2 The majority boldly contends that it is \u201ccircular\u201d to conclude that\na district court may deny a motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\nwhen a party has failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief under\nthat Rule. Maj. Op. at 18\u201319 n.5. But it is beyond cavil that a\nparty\u2019s failure to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances is\nalone a sufficient justification for denying postjudgment relief\nunder Rule 60(b)(6).\n\nApp. 192\namend in favor of other avenues of relief from\njudgment may subsequently seek leave to amend at\nany time and by any means. See 659 F.3d at 214.\nWilliams therefore does not alter the obvious\nconclusion that the district court was within its\ndiscretion to deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here. Id. at 213\n(recognizing that \u201cRule 15(a) [may not] be employed in\na way that is contrary to the philosophy favoring\nfinality of judgments and the expeditious termination\nof litigation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nFor these reasons, I cannot join the majority in\nholding that the district court abused its discretion in\nconcluding that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was untimely\npursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) and that Plaintiffs otherwise\nfailed \nto \nidentify \nextraordinary \ncircumstances\nwarranting relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6). More\nbroadly, I fear that the majority\u2019s decision will erode\nthe finality of judgments throughout this Circuit,\nsignificantly undermine the important purposes served\nby Rule 60(b), and increase the workload of busy\ndistrict court judges who carry the heaviest burden in\nour system of civil justice. I therefore respectfully\ndissent from the majority\u2019s opinion and would affirm\nthe district court\u2019s order. \nA True Copy \nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit\n/s/ Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe\n[SEAL]\n\nApp. 193\n                         \nAPPENDIX I\n                         \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nDocket No: 22-4\n[Filed February 13, 2024]\n_____________________________________________ \nGeorge Mandala, Charles Barnett, individually )\nand on behalf of all others similarly situated, \n)\nPlaintiffs-Appellants, \n)\n)\nv. \n)\n)\nNTT Data, Inc., \n)\nDefendant-Appellee.\n)\n____________________________________________ ) \nAt a stated term of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit, held at the Thurgood\nMarshall United States Courthouse, 40 Foley Square,\nin the City of New York, on the 13th day of February,\ntwo thousand twenty-four. \nORDER \nAppellee, NTT Data, Inc., filed a petition for panel\nrehearing, or, in the alternative, for rehearing en banc.\nThe panel that determined the appeal has considered\nthe request for panel rehearing, and the active\nmembers of the Court have considered the request for\nrehearing en banc. \n\nApp. 194\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is\ndenied. \nFOR THE COURT: \nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n/s/ Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe\n[SEAL]",

As the Opening Brief \nexplained, that outlier approach lacks any basis in \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or context.  It puts Rule 60(b) at \nwar with itself on multiple fronts.  It subverts the \nguiding principles of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  And it contradicts this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThose decisions confirm that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022).  \u201cEven then, \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nmust justify [the] reopening\u201d of a final judgment.  Id. \n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11 (1988)).  And a party\u2019s \u201cfree, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 \n(1950).  Rather, the party must be wholly \u201cfaultless in \nthe delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993). \nRespondents largely ignore these foundational \nprinciples.  That is because they cannot salvage the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s backwards approach or the mess it \nwould make of Rule 60(b) and the Federal Rules more \nbroadly.  Instead, Respondents try to avoid the Second \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, insisting that the court did not \nactually \u201c\u2018jettison\u2019 the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard\u201d and, in fact, \u201cd[id] not \u2018hold\u2019 anything.\u201d  \nResp.Br.22, 25 (citation omitted). \nThey are wrong on both points.  The Second Circuit \nexpressly abandoned the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard, and it held that the District Court erred by \napplying it.  In doing so, the Second Circuit \n\n2 \n \nacknowledged that a \u201cplaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \nRule 60(b)(6) relief \u2018only when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying relief.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  \u201cBut,\u201d according to the \nSecond Circuit, the standard changes when \u201c\u2018vacatur \nis sought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023)).  In that \ncase, the Second Circuit believed that \u201c\u2018special \nconsiderations come into play\u2019\u201d that \u201crequire[] [district \ncourts] to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem.\u201d  Id. (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 361).  Based on that mistaken view of the Federal \nRules, the Second Circuit held that the District Court \nabused its discretion by evaluating Respondents\u2019 Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nThis Court should reverse and hold that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when it \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar to deny relief.  Indeed, \nRespondents\u2019 \nsuggestion \nthat \nextraordinary \ncircumstances exist here only underscores the \nproblems with the Second Circuit\u2019s test.  Everything \nthey point to sounds in \u201cmistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  \nAs a result, Rule 60(b)(6) relief is categorically \nunavailable to them.  Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s one-year deadline \ninstead applies\u2014and it expired before Respondents \nfiled their motion. \nRespondents\u2019 repeated and deliberate waivers also \nforeclose post-judgment relief.  They do not dispute \n\u201cthat they twice declined the opportunity to amend \ntheir Complaint before [the District] Court dismissed \nit,\u201d only to then \u201cwaive[]\u201d any challenge to the \u201c\u2018with \n\n3 \n \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal\u201d on appeal.  \nPet.App.16 & n.4.  Nor do they dispute that it would \nhave been \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d for the lower courts \nto \u201coverride a [litigant\u2019s] deliberate waiver.\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  That should be the end of the matter.  \nRespondents chose to stand or fall on their complaint \nas pled and unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.   \nRespondents gloss over these facts by claiming that \n\u201cthe Second Circuit did not find any waiver.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court did, and the Second \nCircuit nowhere disagreed.  It nonetheless refused to \nuphold the District Court\u2019s decision\u2014notwithstanding \nthe waivers\u2014because the District Court had not given \n\u201cdue regard\u201d to \u201cthe liberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  \nThat was error.  Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d of \ntheir litigation choices merely \u201cbecause hindsight \nseems to indicate\u201d that those decisions were ill-\nadvised.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199.  Thus, Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201chas no application to [this] situation.\u201d  Id. at \n202.  And, because a final judgment is in place, neither \ndoes Rule 15(a). \nThis Court should reverse the decision below, \nreinstate the District Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 \nRule 60(b) motion, and bring this case to an end. \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must Satisfy \nRule 60(b)\u2019s Stringent Standards. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test dilutes Rule \n60(b)\u2019s exacting requirements for post-judgment relief \nwithout any basis in text, context, or precedent.  \nRespondents ignore the glaring problems with that \napproach.  And their arguments only highlight the \nflaws in the decision below. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires \u201cExtraordinary \nCircumstances\u201d Not Covered by Any Other \nProvision of Rule 60(b). \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have \nbeen analyzed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard.  This \nCourt has consistently \u201crequired a movant seeking \nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 \n(2005) (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.Br.23 (collecting cases).  This Court has also long \nstressed that Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d \nwith the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b).  \nLiljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  The Rule\u2019s text and \nstructure dictate both of these principles.  See \nPet.Br.23, 27-28, 31-34.  Yet the decision below flouts \nthem.  And Respondents provide no basis to discard \nthese basic requirements where plaintiffs seek to \nrevive their case with an amended complaint. \nPerhaps recognizing the Second Circuit\u2019s misstep, \nRespondents start off by suggesting that the court did \nnot \u201cabandon[] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \n\n5 \n \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry.\u201d  \nResp.Br.24 (citation omitted).  But that is wrong.  The \ndecision below rebuked the \u201cordinar[y]\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) \nstandard for one that \u201cbalance[s] Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Pet.App.8 (holding \nthat the District Court\u2019s extraordinary circumstances \n\u201cframework for analyzing [Respondents\u2019] motion was \nerroneous as a matter of law\u201d). \nThat analytical mistake was compelled by Second \nCircuit \nprecedent. \n \nIn \nMandala, \nthe \ncourt \nacknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test.  \n88 F.4th at 361.  But then it cast that standard aside \nto hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to amend, a district \ncourt abuses its discretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment \nrelief\u201d based solely on the movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to \ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief under Rule \n60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  That makes no sense.  As Judge \nSullivan countered in his Mandala dissent, \u201cit is \nbeyond cavil that a party\u2019s failure to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances is alone a sufficient \njustification for denying postjudgment relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 369 n.2 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  \nThat is, after all, the standard for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  \nAnd it is the standard that should have applied here. \nRespondents then later pull an about face, \nacknowledging that the Second Circuit did apply a \n\u201cbalancing test\u201d that imports \u201cthe policies embodied in \nRule 15(a)\u201d into the vacatur analysis.  Resp.Br.25 \n(quotation marks omitted).  But they offer no \npersuasive defense of that misguided approach. \n\n6 \n \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Balancing Test \nLacks Any Precedential Support. \nRespondents cannot ground the Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test in the text or context of Rule 60(b)(6).  \nAccordingly, \nthey \nspend \nover \na \ndozen \npages \nmeandering through caselaw (at 25-38) in an effort to \ndownplay the novelty of that outlier position.  But they \nconcede that other decisions are \u201cout of step\u201d with the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  Resp.Br.33.  And \nRespondents do not rely on any case that helps them. \nRespondents fumble (at 27) for support in Krupski \nv. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538 (2010).  But \nthat case addressed the scope of \u201crelation back under \nRule 15(c)(1)(C),\u201d as defined by \u201cthe text of the Rule.\u201d  \nId. at 541, 547.  Krupski said nothing about the proper \nstandard for reopening a judgment under Rule 60(b).  \nThat is the Rule that governs \u201cRelief from a Final \nJudgment, Order, or Proceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nRespondents also double down (at 26-27) on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But they concede that \ncase involved a motion \u201cunder Rule 59(e), not Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Resp.Br.27 n.3.  As explained in the Opening \nBrief, that distinction matters.  See Pet.Br.34-35.  And \nwhile Respondents try to characterize the specific rule \nin Foman as \u201ccompletely irrelevant to this Court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d Resp.Br.27 n.3, that is not true.  The proper \nstandard for a Rule 60(b) motion was not before the \nFoman Court, and Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) impose \n\u201cdifferent standards\u201d for relief \u201cby their own terms.\u201d  \nDaulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. \n2024).  Hence, the Rule 59(e) motion in Foman was \n\u201cnot controlled by the same exacting substantive \nrequirements\u201d codified in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  Priester v. \n\n7 \n \nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 927 F.3d 912, 913 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   \nNor is it surprising that the standards would differ \nbetween the two rules.  They serve markedly different \nfunctions.  A Rule 59(e) motion operates as \u201ca limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding\u201d and plays \u201ca \npart [in] producing the final judgment,\u201d whereas a \nRule 60(b) motion \u201cthreaten[s] an already final \njudgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 519, 521 (2020); see Pet.Br.34-35.  \nRule 60(b) thus naturally poses a higher bar for relief. \nRespondents next trumpet (at 29-31, 33, 35-38) a \nparade of lower court decisions.  But those cases, \nobviously, do not control this Court\u2019s analysis.  And \nmost of them similarly addressed Rule 59(e) motions, \nnot Rule 60(b) motions.1  So, they are simply off-point \nas well.  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are not fungible, and \nRespondents fail to offer any reason to merge the two \ntextually and functionally distinct rules into one. \nNor do any of the few 60(b) cases that Respondents \nlean on (at 29-30) provide them any support.  Those \ndecisions merely recognize that the Rules\u2019 drafters \nalready balanced the needs for \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \n \n1  See, e.g., Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. \n& Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 2015); NewSpin Sports, \nLLC v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d 293, 299 (7th Cir. 2018); \nUnited States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investigations, LLC v. \nVictaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 248-49 (3d Cir. 2016); Jang v. Bos. \nSci. Scimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013); Rosenzweig v. \nAzurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863-64 (5th Cir. 2003); Firestone v. \nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996); S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993); see also \nAllen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, 184 (5th Cir. 2018). \n\n8 \n \nin Rule 60(b) itself.  Phelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, \n1133 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  None suggests \nthat courts should then smuggle in Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading principles as an additional variable to tip \nthe scales against finality under Rule 60(b).  The \nSecond Circuit stands alone by imposing that \nextratextual requirement.2 \nRespondents also rely heavily on United States v. \nMask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nBut that was a Rule 60(b)(1) case, not a Rule 60(b)(6) \ncase.  See id. at 743.  And it only further illustrates \nwhy Respondents are wrong here.  Like every other \nCourt of Appeals, see Pet.Br.21 n.3, the Eighth Circuit \nthere held that courts may grant leave to amend only \nif doing so \u201cis consistent with the stringent standards \ngoverning the grant of . . . Rule 60(b) relief,\u201d 752 F.3d \n \n2  Other decisions cited by Respondents do not address either \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions.  See, e.g., Gondeck v. Pan Am. \nWorld Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, 26-28 (1965); Jack v. Evonik \nCorp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 (5th Cir. 2023); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015); Calvary Christian Ctr. \nv. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 539-41 (4th Cir. 2013); \nUnited States ex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 \n(9th Cir. 2011); Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d \n787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 2004); Duggins v. Steak \u2019n Shake, Inc., 195 \nF.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999); Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d \n557, 559-60 (6th Cir. 1986); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l \nUnion, AFL-CIO v. Delta Refin. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. \n1960); Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 F.2d 349, 351 (D.C. \nCir. 1950).  Nor do any of them deal with circumstances like \nthese, in which Respondents engaged in a \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies identified in their \npleading\u201d prior to dismissal.  Pet.App.19; cf. Foster v. DeLuca, 545 \nF.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008) (no waiver by plaintiff, who filed a \ncombined Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motion just a week after the \ndistrict court terminated the case without warning). \n\n9 \n \nat 743.  It then affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of \npost-judgment relief where, as here, the plaintiff \n\u201cknew many months prior to the Order of Dismissal of \nthe possible need to amend its pleading and elected to \n\u2018stand or fall\u2019\u201d on its complaint.  Id. at 744; see \nPet.App.15-18.  The Second Circuit should have \nreached the same result. \nFinally, Respondents cobble together (at 37) a trio \nof this Court\u2019s precedents that have nothing to do with \nthe question presented in this case.  None even \nmentions Rule 60(b), let alone purports to analyze the \nproper standard for a plaintiff seeking relief from a \nfinal judgment.  Nor did they have occasion to do so.  \nIn Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 \nU.S. 308, 329 (2007), this Court merely remanded for \napplication of a legal standard to the facts alleged.  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 666 (2009), this Court \nconfronted an \u201cinterlocutory appeal,\u201d not an appeal \nfrom a final judgment.  And in Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014), this Court \u201creversed\u201d \nan improper dismissal, meaning there was no longer a \nfinal judgment on remand. \nHere, by contrast, Respondents seek to set aside a \ndismissal with prejudice that was affirmed on appeal.  \nPet.App.49-53.  A final judgment remains in place.  \nThus, Respondents must \u201csatisfy one of the Rule 60(b) \ngrounds before [the] court may consider [a] motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 178.  \u201cThe permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant\u201d until they make that showing.  Garrett \nv. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019).  The \nSecond Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \n\n10 \n \n2. Respondents\u2019 Other Arguments Are \nMeritless. \nBeyond citing inapposite precedents, Respondents \nsay little else to defend the decision below.  They do \nnot suggest that the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nfinds any support in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  They do not rely \non the Rule\u2019s history or structure.  They do not dispute \nthat the decision below thwarts the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nAnd they do not explain how it is \u201cjust\u201d to relieve \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices\u2014which \nwould burden both defendants and the courts with \nduplicative litigation.  Id.; see Pet.Br.37; Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 369 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). \nNor do Respondents grapple with the many ways \nin which the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test clashes \nwith other provisions of Rule 60(b).  See Pet.Br.31-34.  \nThey do not dispute that it enables plaintiffs to evade \nRule 60\u2019s strict time limitations where allegations are \nomitted by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), \n(c)(1).  Nor do they explain why plaintiffs could wield \nRule 60(b)(6) to introduce previously available facts \nyears after judgment, when Rule 60 elsewhere limits \nrelief to matters \u201cnewly discovered\u201d within a year of \njudgment that \u201ccould not have been discovered\u201d before \nwith \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test invites that internal \ninconsistency.  See Mandala, 88 F.4th at 365 (ordering \nvacatur and amendment \u201cbased on information that \nwas publicly available for years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint\u201d). \nAs to mistake, Respondents claim that \u201cthe Second \nCircuit has never suggested that vacatur and \n\n11 \n \namendment are permissible where a complaint failed \ndue to counsel\u2019s mistake.\u201d  Resp.Br.43.  But, even \nsetting aside the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) is not limited \nto counsel\u2019s mistakes, see Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534-35, \nthe Second Circuit has required just that.  It deployed \nits balancing test in Mandala to compel the reopening \nof a final judgment, even though the \u201cvacatur motion \nar[ose] from a legal mistake based on insufficient \npleading.\u201d  88 F.4th at 360.  That is precisely \nRespondents\u2019 theory here too\u2014that they made a legal \nmistake as to which facts they needed to allege to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s statutory standard.  See Resp.Br.45.3 \nRetreating from Rule 60(b), Respondents note that \nRule 15 \u201ccontemplates two stages of amendment\u2014\nbefore trial and during or after trial.\u201d  Resp.Br.42.  Yet, \nthey fail to explain why that might bear on the \nthreshold vacatur inquiry, which necessarily occurs in \nthe post-judgment context.  At that point, \u201c[t]he suit is \nover.\u201d  Pe\u00f1a v. Mattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996).  \n\u201cThere is no complaint to amend.\u201d  Id.  And \nRespondents concede \u201cthat Rule 15(a) \u2018does not \nprovide a mechanism for amending pleadings after \ndismissal.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.42 (quoting Pet.Br.30).  Rather, \nRule 60(b) defines the \u201climited set of circumstances\u201d \nthat might allow the losing party to \u201crequest \nreopening of his case.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  \n \n3  To be clear, Respondents\u2019 proposed amendments still fail to \nmeet JASTA\u2019s pleading standards under this Court\u2019s decision in \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023), and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s own precedents.  That question is not presented here \nbecause the District Court correctly instructed the parties not to \naddress futility (a Rule 15 question) until Respondents first \ndemonstrated that they could justify vacatur under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014which they could not.  See Pet.App.11, 13; JA.509. \n\n12 \n \nWhile Respondents baldly insist that Rule 15(a) lurks \nin the background to \u201cpresumably inform[] the reasons \nthat \u2018justify relief\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d Resp.Br.42-\n43, that is simply wrong.  \u201cAs long as the judgment \nremains in effect, Rule 15(a) is inapposite.\u201d  Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 508-09 (1st Cir. 2009). \nIf anything, Respondents\u2019 invocation of Rule 15(b) \nrefutes their approach.  That Rule contemplates two \ntypes of late-breaking amendments, neither of which \napplies here.  First, if a party objects that its \nopponent\u2019s evidence at trial deviates from the \npleadings, then the \u201ccourt should freely permit an \namendment when doing so will aid in presenting the \nmerits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court \nthat the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action \nor defense on the merits.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(1).  \nSecond, \u201c[w]hen an issue not raised by the pleadings \nis tried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent, it \nmust be treated in all respects as if raised in the \npleadings.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2).  In that situation, \n\u201c[a] party may move\u2014at any time, even after \njudgment\u2014to amend the pleadings to conform them to \nthe evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue.\u201d  Id.4  \nRule 15 thus contemplates a single, narrow, consent-\nbased ground for a party to amend \u201cafter judgment.\u201d  \nId.  In turn, the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d of expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius confirms that Rule 15 does not apply \nto any other post-judgment efforts to amend.  Bittner \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 94 (2023).  Rather, post-\n \n4  A \u201cfailure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that \nissue.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2).  But amendment can be \u201cuseful in \nclarifying the record on appeal or in determining the preclusive \neffects to be given to the judgment.\u201d  3 James Wm. Moore et al., \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.18[1] (3d ed. 2024). \n\n13 \n \njudgment relief falls squarely within the bailiwick of \nRule 60(b). \nTaking a slightly different tack, Respondents insist \nthat \u201c[p]laintiffs should have the opportunity to have \ntheir case adjudicated on the merits.\u201d  Resp.Br.24.  But \nthey did, in fact, have their case decided on the merits:  \nA final \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d is an \u201cadjudication \non the merits.\u201d  Lomax v. Ortiz-Marquez, 590 U.S. 595, \n601 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).  Respondents \nmerely lost that merits battle.  Along the way, they \ndeliberately chose to stand on their complaint.  They \ndeclined to appeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d aspect of the \ndismissal.  Then they lost again on appeal.  As a result, \nthey cannot reopen the judgment to pursue an \namended complaint unless they satisfy the strictures \nof Rule 60(b). \nIn short, where a losing party seeks leave to file an \namended complaint following a final judgment, it \nmust first clear Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately high hurdle \nfor setting aside that judgment.  The Second Circuit \nerred in collapsing these two inquiries into a single, \nnebulous balancing test. \nB. Respondents Concede that Rule 60(b)(6) \nProvides No Basis for Relief from a Party\u2019s \nVoluntary Litigation Choices. \nRespondents likewise cannot square the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach with basic principles of waiver.  \nIndeed, they do not contest that it would be an abuse \nof discretion for a court to \u201cexcuse a party\u2019s voluntary \nwaiver of a court\u2019s invitation to amend.\u201d  Pet.Br.28; see \nWood, 566 U.S. at 472-73.   \n\n14 \n \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of justice \u201cis designed around the premise that \nparties represented by competent counsel know what \nis best for them, and are responsible for advancing the \nfacts and argument entitling them to relief.\u201d  United \nStates v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375-76 (2020) \n(citation and brackets omitted).  Thus, where a \nplaintiff makes a \u201cvoluntary\u201d choice to rest on their \npleadings\u2014thereby waiving the opportunity to amend \ntheir complaint\u2014Rule 60(b)(6) provides no recourse.  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 200. \nThat principle applies with equal force to \nforfeitures in the context of Rule 60(b)(6).  Rule 60(b) \nmakes clear that if a party is even \u201cpartly to blame for \nthe delay, relief must be sought within one year under \nsubsection (1) and the party\u2019s neglect must be \nexcusable.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That \nparty cannot \u201cseek relief more than a year after the \njudgment by resorting to subsection (6).\u201d  Id.; see \nPet.Br.27-28.   \nRespondents do not contest this either.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s balancing test contravenes that \nframework.  It enables plaintiffs to obtain relief \nthrough Rule 60(b)(6) even when they \u201cwere \nrepeatedly apprised\u201d prior to judgment of the \u201cprecise \npleading defect\u201d that led to dismissal.  Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 368 (Sullivan, J., dissenting); see also \nPet.App.19 (similar).  Granting such a mulligan to \nplaintiffs who caused their own predicament defies the \ntext and structure of Rule 60(b). \nNone of this is to suggest that Rule 60(b) can never \nprovide an avenue for plaintiffs seeking to set aside a \njudgment to pursue an amended complaint.  But the \n\n15 \n \nRule itself sets the parameters for doing so.  For \ninstance, if a plaintiff\u2019s belated allegations were \nomitted because of its \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cexcusable \nneglect,\u201d then Rule 60(b)(1) provides a year in which \nto seek relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  The same \ngoes for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that could not \nhave been found earlier with \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  And so too for a \u201cmistake\u201d \nmade by either the court or the parties or their \nattorneys\u2014whether that be an \u201cerror[] \u2018of law or fact.\u2019\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 534 (quoting Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 1195 (3d ed. 1933)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  A party can also seek relief under Rule 59(e)\u2019s \nmore forgiving standard within 28 days of judgment.  \nOr, in rare cases, truly extraordinary circumstances \noutside the party\u2019s control might justify relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).  Cf. Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. \n601, 613-15 (1949) (lead op.). \nBut what plaintiffs cannot do is what Respondents \ndid here\u2014waive multiple opportunities to amend, \nlitigate the matter to final judgment, drag their \nopponent through an unsuccessful appeal, and then \ntry to use Rule 60(b)(6) to start the process all over.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday, and free, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6). \nUnder the proper Rule 60(b)(6) standard, this is a \nstraightforward \ncase. \n \nPetitioner \nrepeatedly \nemphasized that the complaint failed to allege that the \nbank was aware of a link between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas \u201cat the time\u201d it provided the \ncustomers routine banking services.  Pet.App.109; \n\n16 \n \nJA.145; JA.175-77; JA.249-51.  On multiple occasions, \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nafforded \nRespondents \nthe \nopportunity to cure any deficiencies in their pleadings \nthrough amendment.  Pet.App.93-94; Pet.App.124-25.  \nAnd, each time, Respondents \u201cexpressly declined\u201d the \ninvitation.  Pet.App.17-18.   \nThe District Court then dismissed their complaint, \nexplaining that it failed to plausibly allege Petitioner \n\u201cwas aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time.\u201d  Pet.App.74-75.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cbecause the allegations \ndo not support an inference that [Petitioner] was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Only then did \nRespondents seek to reopen the judgment to file an \namended complaint\u2014in direct contradiction to their \nprior position that they \u201cwould not seek leave to \namend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nThis is thus a classic case of litigator\u2019s remorse, for \nwhich Rule 60(b)(6) provides no relief.  Through \nsophisticated counsel, Respondents repeatedly waived \nor forfeited opportunities to amend their complaint in \nboth the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  \nThese litigation choices led to dismissal with prejudice \nand affirmance on appeal.  And Respondents have not \n\u201cshow[n] \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justifying the \nreopening of a final judgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at \n535 (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.App.14-19.  The District Court certainly did not \nabuse its discretion in reaching that conclusion.   \nRespondents conspicuously fail to address this \ndeferential standard of review anywhere in their brief.  \n\n17 \n \nAnd their last-ditch effort (at 44-49) to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances falls flat.   \nTo start, Respondents insist that they \u201chave yet to \nbe afforded a single opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint.\u201d  Resp.Br.45 (citation omitted).  That is \ncategorically false.  They \u201ctwice expressly declined the \nopportunity to amend their complaint prior to the \n[District] Court\u2019s decision.\u201d  Pet.App.10.  And \nRespondents did not challenge the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \naspect of the dismissal during their first appeal.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  Those decisions were \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate,\u201d and Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d \nfrom the consequences of those voluntary choices \nthrough Rule 60(b)(6).  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198; \nsee Pet.App.19.   \nRespondents elsewhere concede there is nothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d about dismissing a complaint where \n\u201cthe plaintiff has had a meaningful chance to amend.\u201d  \nResp.Br.34.  And their claim that the multiple chances \nthey received were not \u201cmeaningful\u201d is flatly incorrect.  \nResp.Br.46.  Prior to dismissal, they were consistently \napprised of the timing mismatch between their \nallegations of general awareness and Petitioner\u2019s \nalleged provision of banking services.  See Pet.App.19.  \nPetitioner raised this argument in its pre-motion \nletter, see JA.144-45, in its memorandum of law \nsupporting the motion to dismiss, see JA.160-61, 174-\n85, and in its statements at oral argument, see \nPet.App.108-09.  Yet, Respondents chose not to amend. \nThis requirement of contemporaneous awareness \nwas also nothing new.  It traces directly to Halberstam \nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which both \nCongress and the Second Circuit had already \n\n18 \n \nrecognized as providing the \u201cproper legal framework\u201d \nfor JASTA liability.  Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d \n314, 329 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting JASTA, Pub. L. No. \n114-222, \u00a7 2(a)(5), 130 Stat. 852, 852 (2016)).  In fact, \nRespondents themselves urged the court to apply the \nHalberstam \nframework\u2014and \nacknowledged \nits \nrequirement that \u201cthe defendant must be generally \naware of his role . . . at the time he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  JA.210 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477).  Respondents have \nnever \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not allege facts \nsufficient to satisfy the standard for which they were \nadvocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  Nor have they argued \n\u201cthat any of their proposed new allegations were \nunavailable to them when given the opportunity to \namend.\u201d  Pet.App.15.  At best, their tactical decisions \nnot \nto \namend \nwere \nthe \nresult \nof \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1).  And they were time-barred from \nreopening on that basis.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  \nThey cannot end-run those limitations via Rule \n60(b)(6).  See Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533; Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393.5 \nRespondents next argue that the District Court\u2019s \n\u201cdismissal decision was premised on \u2018the wrong legal \n \n5  Respondents misconstrue (at 44) this interplay between \n60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6).  Petitioner has explained at length why \n\u201cRespondents cannot satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.\u201d  \nPet.Br.38-45 (capitalization altered).  And that is in part because \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion is, at best, \u201cbased on grounds \nspecified in clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  \nAccordingly, they cannot avail themselves of Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cany \nother reason\u201d language.  Id. (citation omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(6); Pet.Br.1, 16-17, 27-29, 31-33, 43-44.   \n\n19 \n \nstandard.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.47.  But that argument similarly \nruns straight into the teeth of Rule 60(b)(1), which \n\u201ccovers all mistakes of law made by a judge.\u201d  Kemp, \n596 U.S. at 534.  Rule 60(b)(6) is thus inapplicable.  \nSee id. at 533. \nMoreover, any supposed legal errors cannot excuse \nRespondents\u2019 waivers here because the District Court \ndid not articulate what standard it would apply until \nit issued its decision.  That decision came after \nRespondents proclaimed they \u201cwould not seek leave to \namend\u201d and after they confirmed \u201c[t]here are no facts \nthat [they] would have\u201d to address the deficiencies \nPetitioner identified\u2014including the lack of allegations \nsupporting awareness.  Pet.App.94, 125.  Respondents\u2019 \nallegations on this front were deficient in both the eyes \nof the District Court and the Second Circuit.  And the \n\u201c[District] \nCourt\u2019s \nruling \nthat \n[Respondents\u2019] \ncomplaint d[id] not plausibly allege that [Petitioner] \nwas generally aware of any connection between the \nThree Customers and Hamas [was] not meaningfully \ndifferent from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling as to this \nsame basis for affirming th[e] Court\u2019s dismissal.\u201d  \nPet.App.15 n.3 (quotation marks omitted); see \nPet.App.49-52. \nTo the extent the two decisions differed, any \n\u201cclarification\u201d by the Second Circuit did not compel the \nDistrict Court to reopen its affirmed final judgment.  \nCongress did not amend JASTA, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s decision in the first appeal did not overrule \nprior precedents.  It merely applied the statutory text \nand existing caselaw to the facts alleged.  Thus, there \nwas no change in law.  Respondents instead argue only \nthat the District Court \u201cmisapplied controlling law.\u201d  \n\n20 \n \nResp.Br.12 (emphasis added).  In Kemp, this Court \nheld that this precise type of attack on a final \njudgment falls within Rule 60(b)(1), not Rule 60(b)(6).  \nSee 596 U.S. at 535 n.2 (\u201cKemp alleged that the \nDistrict Court erred by misapplying controlling \nlaw[.]\u201d); see also Pet.Br.32-33, 40-41.6   \nFurther, to the extent Respondents claim they \n\u201ccould not anticipate\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \nResp.Br.48, that too is just another way of saying they \nwere \u201csurprise[d],\u201d made a pleading \u201cmistake,\u201d or \nfailed to include the allegations previously available to \nthem because of \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  All of those grounds for relief \nare explicitly covered by Rule 60(b)(1), and thus fall \noutside Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cother reason\u201d language. \nIn any event, this case pales in comparison to those \nfew extraordinary cases where this Court has found \nRule 60(b)(6) relief appropriate.  In Klapprott, for \nexample, the petitioner sought to set aside a default \njudgment renouncing his citizenship, because he had \nbeen \u201cweakened from illness,\u201d unable to obtain \ncounsel, \u201cwrongfully\u201d detained, and then imprisoned \nby \n\u201chis \nadversary \nin \nthe \ndenaturalization \nproceedings,\u201d with \u201cno reasonable opportunity\u201d to \ndefend himself.  335 U.S. at 607-08, 613-15.  In \n \n6  Respondents insist (at 48) that an outright change in law might \nsometimes justify post-judgment relief.  But this Court has made \nclear that a change in law is not per se \u201cextraordinary.\u201d  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-37.  Whether it ever can be a basis for \n60(b)(6) relief, as opposed to a \u201c\u2018mistake\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(1),\u201d is \nan open question.  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 535 n.2.  Regardless, \nbecause the law here did not change and Respondents argue only \nthat the District Court \u201cmisapplied controlling law,\u201d this Court \nneed not address the issue. \n\n21 \n \nLiljeberg, the judge who presided over a bench trial \n\u201cinexcusabl[y]\u201d failed to recuse himself, despite an \n\u201cobvious conflict of interest\u201d that the movant could not \nreasonably discover.  486 U.S. at 850, 863-66 & n.11.  \nAnd in Buck v. Davis, the petitioner \u201cidentified 11 \nfactors\u201d in his capital murder case\u2014including the \nintroduction of expert evidence suggesting \u201cthe color \nof [his] skin made him more deserving of execution,\u201d \nthe State\u2019s confession of error in similar cases, and \nchanged controlling law that removed a procedural \n\u201cbar[]\u201d to habeas review\u2014which could collectively \nwarrant relief.  580 U.S. 100, 113, 118-26 (2017). \nThis case is a far cry from those.  Respondents \u201chad \nample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but simply chose not to \npursue them.  Pet.App.16.  They are hardly \u201cfaultless \nin the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nThat precludes them from obtaining relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), and the District Court certainly did not abuse \nits discretion by denying Respondents\u2019 motion.   \nSwitching gears, Respondents assert that the \n\u201cburden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss\u201d is \u201cnot the \nkind of prejudice\u201d contemplated by Rule 15(a).  \nResp.Br.45.  Again, though, Respondents needed to \nsatisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \nvacating the final judgment \u201cbefore consideration \n[could] be given to [a Rule 15(a)] motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Those two Rules pose \nseparate inquiries.  See Pet.Br.20-38.  In any case, \nRespondents waived multiple opportunities to amend, \nand the \u201cfederal rule of waiver does not include a \nprejudice requirement.\u201d  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 419 (2022).  Even if it did, Petitioner \n\n22 \n \nwould clearly suffer prejudice if the Court were to \nnullify a final judgment\u2014secured after costly motions \npractice and then successfully defended in a \nprotracted appeal\u2014so that Respondents could pursue \na strategy they repeatedly rebuffed.  That is not how \nfederal litigation works. \nNor can Respondents dispute that they made a \n\u201cseries \nof \ndeliberate \nchoices\u201d \nnot \nto \namend.  \nPet.App.19.  They try to duck that inescapable \nconclusion as one \u201cnot accepted by the panel below.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court made that factual \nfinding, and the Second Circuit did not disturb it.  Nor \ncould it, because Respondents waived or forfeited at \nleast five opportunities to amend\u2014each of which \nsuffices to bar relief.  \nFirst, the District Court asked Respondents at the \npre-motion conference if they wanted the \u201copportunity \nto amend\u201d to plead \u201cadditional facts\u201d based on \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel replied \u201cNo,\u201d and he averred that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend\u201d if the pleadings fell short.  \nPet.App.94.  That is a textbook waiver. \nSecond, the District Court asked at oral argument \non the motion to dismiss whether \u201ceverything [it] \nneed[ed] to consider in terms of sufficiency of [the] \npleading [was] going to be found in the complaint.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  Respondents\u2019 counsel answered \u201cYes, \nYour Honor.\u201d  Pet.App.125.  Another textbook waiver. \nThird, Respondents opted not to file a Rule 59(e) \nmotion after the District Court\u2019s decision.  Doing so \nwould have enabled the court to consider a proposed \namended complaint and \u201cfix any mistakes\u201d that \n\n23 \n \nRespondents believed the court made, \u201cbefore a \npossible appeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. \nFourth, Respondents \u201cnever appealed the \u2018with \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal, and accordingly, \nwaived it.\u201d  Pet.App.16 n.4.  Yet they seek the same \nrelief that such an appeal could have provided, while \ntacitly conceding that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as \na substitute for appeal.\u201d  Pet.Br.44 (citation omitted). \nFifth, Respondents continued to sit on their hands \nbefore the Second Circuit, even though they admit \nthat \u201casking the circuit for leave to amend [was] \npermissible.\u201d  Resp.Br.40.  They forfeited that \nopportunity in their opening brief; they forfeited it in \ntheir reply brief; they forfeited it at oral argument; \nand they forfeited it in their supplemental brief. \n*   *   * \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test \ncollapses under the weight of text, context, structure, \nand precedent.  The proper inquiry for this Rule \n60(b)(6) motion is the one that has always applied to \nRule 60(b)(6) motions:  Respondents had to \u201cshow \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d not covered by any \nother provision of the Rule, that were beyond their \ncontrol and that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a \nfinal judgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (citation \nomitted).  They failed to meet that high bar. \n \n \n\n24 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal monologue detailing a revised search strategy to locate the Petitioner's reply brief. This observation is purely procedural and meta-cognitive; it contains no new substantive information, facts, legal arguments, or signals related to the case itself. As a result, it does not provide any new evidence to update my predictive model of the Supreme Court's potential ruling. My entire previous belief state is preserved, and the information gap I have previously identified remains the most critical uncertainty.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Central Procedural Conflict:** My understanding of the case's core tension between two interpretations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure remains unchanged and stable.\n    *   **Petitioner's Framework (Confirmed & Stable):** The Petitioner's confirmed position is that a litigant must first satisfy the stringent \"extraordinary circumstances\" test of Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment *before* the court can consider the liberal amendment standard of Rule 15(a). This textualist, sequential approach prioritizes the finality of judgments.\n    *   **Respondents' Framework (Stable):** The Respondents argue for a more holistic, equitable approach, contending that the \"extraordinary circumstances\" analysis under Rule 60(b)(6) inherently involves balancing factors, including the merits of the proposed amendment and the pursuit of justice, effectively blending the considerations of the two rules.\n\n2.  **Stable Understanding of Competing Narratives:** The key narratives deployed by each side remain in direct opposition, and my understanding of them is unchanged.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative (Confirmed & Stable):** My belief, confirmed by the Petitioner's opening brief, is that they are framing the Respondents as litigants who made a \"free, calculated, deliberate choice\" (*Ackermann v. United States*) to stand on their initial complaint. By gambling and losing, they are not \"faultless\" (*Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co.*) and thus are undeserving of equitable relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\n    *   **Respondents' \"No Meaningful Opportunity\" Narrative (Stable):** This remains the primary counter-argument. The Respondents' position is that their choice was not truly \"meaningful\" because the district court applied the wrong legal standard, which was only clarified later on appeal. They argue the extraordinary circumstance is the unique combination of this judicial error and the lack of a prior chance to amend under the correct legal framework.\n\n3.  **Stable View on the Circuit Split Framing:** My belief about how each party frames the existing disagreement among the Courts of Appeals is stable.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deep National Division\" Argument (Confirmed & Stable):** The Petitioner explicitly leverages the circuit split, portraying the Second Circuit's balancing test as an \"outlier\" and emphasizing the need for national uniformity\u2014a classic appeal to the Supreme Court's institutional role.\n    *   **Respondents' \"Broader Consensus\" Argument (Stable):** The Respondents' counter-strategy of reframing the Second Circuit's test as part of a broader, more nuanced consensus on applying equity in Rule 60(b)(6) situations remains a key part of their case.\n\nIn summary, this observation provides no new information about the case itself. It merely documents the agent's internal reasoning about how to overcome a persistent information-gathering problem. My belief state is therefore unchanged. The central uncertainty remains precisely where it was: how the Petitioner, in their reply brief, will dismantle the Respondents' powerful counter-arguments that Rule 60(b)(6) inherently involves balancing and that their failure to amend was not a \"meaningful\" strategic choice. The repeated failure to find this document, now coupled with a documented plan for a new search, only underscores its critical importance as the single most informative piece of evidence needed to update my predictive model.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, a successful docket search, represents a major information gain, filling the critical gap identified in my previous belief state. I have now located and analyzed the key briefs from both parties, including the Petitioner's Petition for Certiorari, the Respondents' Brief in Opposition, the Petitioner's Reply Brief for Certiorari, and the main merits briefs for both sides. This allows me to move from inferred positions to confirmed, detailed legal arguments and to identify the central points of contention the Supreme Court will have to resolve.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Central Procedural Conflict (Now with Full Textual Support):** My core understanding of the conflict is stable but now deeply substantiated by the full set of briefs.\n    *   **Petitioner's Framework (Confirmed & Elaborated):** The Petitioner's briefs (Petition, Merits Brief, and Reply Briefs) consistently and forcefully argue for a strict, sequential, and textualist application of the Federal Rules. Their position is that a litigant must *first* satisfy the stringent \"extraordinary circumstances\" test of Rule 60(b) to vacate a final judgment. Only *after* that high bar is cleared can a court consider a motion to amend under Rule 15(a)'s liberal standard. The Petitioner's Reply Brief (Doc 19) explicitly rejects collapsing the two standards, stating the Second Circuit is now \"alone in the Nation\" in doing so. This framing strongly appeals to the Supreme Court's interest in procedural uniformity and textual fidelity.\n    *   **Respondents' Framework (Confirmed & Elaborated):** The Respondents' Brief in Opposition (Doc 5) and Merits Brief (Doc 8) confirm their holistic, equitable argument. They contend that the district court applied an \"erroneous and nearly impossible pleading standard,\" which was later corrected on appeal. This judicial error, they argue, constitutes the \"extraordinary circumstance\" under Rule 60(b)(6). They posit that the Rule 60(b)(6) analysis is not a rigid gate but an equitable balancing test that *inherently* requires consideration of the merits of the proposed amendment and the pursuit of justice, thus naturally implicating Rule 15(a)'s principles.\n\n2.  **Stable Understanding of Competing Narratives (Now with Rebuttals):** The core narratives are stable, but I now possess the Petitioner's direct rebuttal to the Respondents' story, which was the primary uncertainty in my previous belief state.\n    *   **Petitioner's \"Deliberate Choice\" Narrative (Confirmed & Strengthened):** The Petitioner's Reply Brief (Doc 19) directly confronts the Respondents' position by framing their decision not to amend as a \"free, calculated, [and] deliberate\" choice, citing *Ackermann v. United States*. They argue that by choosing to \"stand on their complaint\" and appeal, the Respondents gambled and lost. Because they are not \"faultless,\" they are not entitled to the \"extraordinary relief\" of Rule 60(b)(6). This directly counters the Respondents' claim that their choice was not meaningful.\n    *   **Respondents' \"No Meaningful Opportunity\" Narrative (Confirmed & Detailed):** The Respondents' briefs (Docs 5, 8) flesh out their counter-narrative. They argue their choice was not a \"meaningful\" one because amending would have been futile under the \"wrong legal standard\" the district court was applying at the time\u2014a standard the Second Circuit later found \"too exacting.\" The \"extraordinary circumstance\" is this unique combination of judicial error followed by a legal clarification that provided the *first* meaningful opportunity to plead their case correctly.\n\n3.  **New & Critical Belief: The Precedential Fault Line - *Foman* vs. *Gonzalez***: The briefs reveal a crucial legal dispute over the controlling precedent, a new and highly informative signal.\n    *   **Respondents' Reliance on *Foman v. Davis***: The Respondents' briefs (Docs 5, 8) heavily rely on *Foman v. Davis*, which holds that it is an abuse of discretion to deny a post-judgment motion to amend without a justifying reason (like futility, bad faith, etc.). They argue *Foman*'s spirit\u2014favoring decisions on the merits over technicalities\u2014should guide the Rule 60(b)(6) analysis here.\n    *   **Petitioner's Rebuttal with *Gonzalez* and *Banister***: The Petitioner's Reply Brief (Doc 19) provides the critical counter-argument. They contend *Foman* is irrelevant because it involved a motion under Rule 59(e), which is filed within 28 days and suspends a judgment's finality. They argue this case, involving a Rule 60(b) motion filed months after a final, affirmed judgment, is governed by the much stricter standard from *Gonzalez v. Crosby*, which requires \"extraordinary circumstances.\" They cite *Banister v. Davis* to emphasize the material difference in scope and purpose between the two rules. This dispute over the applicable legal framework is now the central legal question for my prediction.\n\n4.  **Stable View on Circuit Split Framing (Now Confirmed as a Primary Argument):** The Petitioner's briefs confirm that leveraging the circuit split is a primary strategy. The Reply Brief (Doc 19) explicitly states the Second Circuit's approach is an \"outlier\" and that it \"conflicts with that of eleven other circuits.\" This direct, forceful framing is a powerful signal to the Supreme Court, which prioritizes resolving such deep divisions.\n\nIn summary, the new documents have resolved my previous uncertainty about the Petitioner's rebuttal strategy and have illuminated a critical new point of contention regarding the controlling precedent (*Foman* vs. *Gonzalez*). My belief state has evolved from a high-level understanding of the conflict to a granular analysis of the specific legal arguments and precedential clashes. The key uncertainty for my prediction is no longer *what* the arguments are, but *how* the Supreme Court will resolve them: will they view the Respondents' actions as a \"deliberate choice\" under *Ackermann*, and will they strictly separate the standards for Rule 59(e) (*Foman*) and Rule 60(b) (*Gonzalez*) as the Petitioner urges? The Petitioner's framing of a stark 11-1 circuit split significantly increases the likelihood that the Court will favor a rule that promotes national uniformity, likely aligning with the majority of circuits.",

Respondents do not seriously \ndispute that the Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule \n60(b)\u2019s stringent standard places it on the short end of \na lopsided circuit split.  In fact, Respondents entirely \nignore the conflicting decisions of several Courts of \nAppeals.  And they get no further with their efforts to \ndistinguish a few bricks in the wall of precedents from \nevery other Circuit that has rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier approach.  Those decisions make clear \nthat the Second Circuit is now \u201calone in the Nation in \ncollapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard \nfor Rule 15(a).\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, \n177 (4th Cir. 2024). \nRespondents similarly do not dispute that, \u201c[t]o \njustify relief under [Rule 60(b)(6)], a party must show \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 suggesting that the \nparty is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  Nor do \nthey dispute that, in this case, their repeated decisions \nnot to amend were \u201cfree, calculated, [and] deliberate.\u201d  \nAckermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).  \nThat should foreclose the extraordinary relief \nRespondents seek here.  \nInstead, Respondents\u2019 primary response is to fault \nthe Petition for not discussing Foman v. Davis, 371 \nU.S. 178 (1962).  But there is a very good reason for \nthat:  Foman involved a Rule 59(e) motion, while this \ncase concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  Indeed, \n\n2 \nthis Court recently emphasized that very point in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), when it refused \nto conflate the two Rules in the habeas context.  Thus, \nFoman\u2019s discussion of Rule 59(e) does not affect the \nRule 60(b)(6) analysis here.   \nInstead, the relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s decisions squarely conflict with Gonzalez by \neschewing Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent rule in favor of a \n\u201cliberal repleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  No other \nCircuit has adopted that misguided approach.   \nUnable to wash away the circuit split or the Second \nCircuit\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedent, \nRespondents try to ward off review by labeling this \ncase \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d  But that is patently incorrect.  \nThis appeal arises from Respondents\u2019 attempt to \nvacate a final judgment that was entered nearly five \nyears ago.  And the ruling denying that motion was \nitself a final order.  Relief from this Court would thus \nfinally end this case, while denying review would \nthwart the efficiency and finality principles that \nanimate the Federal Rules. \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s unprecedented \ndilution of Rule 60(b)(6) conflicts with this Court\u2019s \ndecisions and those of every other Circuit.  It threatens \nto undermine the finality of judgments.  It encourages \nwasteful litigation tactics.  And, as a matter of law, the \ndecision below is simply wrong.  This Court should \ngrant review and reverse.   \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Approach Conflicts \nWith That Of Eleven Other Circuits.  \nRespondents concede the existence of a circuit split \nby failing to address the conflicting decisions \nPetitioner identified from the First, Third, Eighth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Although Respondents \ncherry-pick quotes from some of the others, a review \nof those decisions confirms an irreconcilable split \nbetween the Second Circuit\u2019s newly developed test for \nRule 60(b) motions and the correct test used in the rest \nof the Courts of Appeals. \nA. Respondents Concede that a Circuit Split \nExists.   \nRespondents \ncompletely \nignore \nthen-Judge \nBreyer\u2019s decision for the First Circuit in James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71 (1983).  There, as here, the First \nCircuit confronted a district court\u2019s denial of a post-\njudgment motion to amend a dismissed complaint.  Id. \nat 77.  In affirming, then-Judge Breyer explained that \n\u201cto require the district court to permit amendment \nhere would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to \njudgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the case by \namending their complaint to take account of the \ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 78.  The First Circuit rebuked \nthat approach because it \u201cwould dramatically \nundermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of \njudicial decisions.\u201d  Id.  That reasoning flatly \ncontradicts the \u201cliberal amendment policy\u201d endorsed \nby the Second Circuit.  Pet.App.7.  But Respondents \ndo not even acknowledge the case. \n\n4 \nRespondents also ignore the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d \nCir. 2019).  In Garrett, the Third Circuit explained \nthat, when a party seeks \u201cto reopen a final judgment, \nthe policy favoring the finality of judgments\u201d is \nimplicated, and \u201c[t]he permissive policy favoring \namendment under Rule 15 [is] simply not relevant.\u201d  \nId. at 86.  Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the post-judgment context, \nthe narrow grounds for relief set forth\u201d in Rule 60(b) \n\u201cmust guide a District Court\u2019s decision about whether \nan otherwise-final judgment should  be disturbed.\u201d  Id.\nThe Third Circuit therefore recognizes\u2014unlike the \nSecond Circuit\u2014that \u201ca different set of rules \nemphasizing vastly different policies\u201d pertain to a \nmotion seeking to vacate a final judgment for the \npurposes of amending a complaint.  Id.\nRespondents likewise ignore the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in MacPhee v. MiMedx Grp., Inc., 73 F.4th \n1220 (11th Cir. 2023).  As in this case, the district \ncourt there denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for post-\njudgment vacatur-for-amendment, \u201cexplaining that \nbecause [the plaintiff] waited until after judgment was \nentered to seek such relief, Rule 15(a) did not apply.\u201d  \nId. at 1238.  Unless the plaintiff could first show \n\u201centitle[ment] to relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d it \n\u201cwas not entitled to leave to amend post-judgment.\u201d  \nId.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, embracing this \nrestrictive approach even \u201cwhere the plaintiff has not \nexercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as a \nmatter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250.  Again, that is directly \nat odds with the Second Circuit\u2019s belief that plaintiffs \nneed not \u201cnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before \nthey [can] invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading \n\n5 \npolicy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And, again, Respondents \nconspicuously fail to address it.  \nThe same goes for UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 \nF.4th 1047 (8th Cir. 2024).  As the Eighth Circuit held \nthere, \u201cthe liberal amendment standard in Rule \n15(a)(2) does not govern\u201d for post-judgment motions \nseeking to amend a complaint.  Id. at 1057. Instead, \n\u201ca more restrictive standard reflecting interests of \nfinality applies.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  That is, \n\u201c[l]eave to amend will be granted if\u201d\u2014and only if\u2014\u201cit \nis consistent with the stringent standards governing \nthe grant of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  Id.\n(cleaned up).  Respondents once again ignore this \ndecision, which squarely conflicts with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement that district courts \u201cbalance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Mandala v. \nNTT Data, 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023).   \nRespondents similarly ignore the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for \nunsuccessful litigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. \nGates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To be sure, \nRespondents obliquely note that the D.C. Circuit has \nallowed \npost-judgment \namendment \nin \n\u201ccertain \ncircumstances.\u201d  BIO.27.  But those are where the \nmovant has \u201cprevailed on the claim in question.\u201d  Bldg. \nIndus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nRespondents\u2019 claims were dismissed with prejudice, \nand that dismissal was affirmed on appeal.  \n\n6 \nIn short, by their own omissions, Respondents \nconcede the decision below conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. \nCircuits.  That alone should warrant review. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Discussion of Other Circuit \nDecisions \nConfirms \nthat \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit Has Adopted an Outlier Approach. \nThe circuit split extends far beyond the cases \nRespondents ignore.   \nMost notably, in Daulatzai, the Fourth Circuit \nspecifically rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in a \nthoroughly reasoned opinion.   See 97 F.4th at 180.  \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial \nof a Rule 60(b) motion.  In so doing, the Fourth Circuit \nconfronted the exact error that the Second Circuit \ncommitted in Mandala and this case.  It expressly \n\u201creject[ed] \nDaulatzai\u2019s \nargument\u201d \nthat \nearlier \nprecedents \u201ccollapsing . . . the standards under Rule \n59(e) and Rule 15(a) should also apply when the \nmotion seeks relief from the judgment under Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphases added).  Thus, unlike the \nSecond Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has correctly held \nthat, \u201cwhen the motion to vacate is filed under Rule \n60(b), the more restrictive standard for granting that \nmotion must be satisfied before consideration can be \ngiven to the motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphasis \nadded).  By contrast, the Second Circuit here faulted \nthe District Court for \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \nvacate and amend as calling for two distinct analyses\u201d \nunder Rule 60(b) and then Rule 15(a).  Pet.App.7-8; see \n\n7 \nalso Mandala 88 F.4th at 361.  The two approaches \nare impossible to square.1\nRespondents only further underscore this error by \ntrying to leverage a pair of Second Circuit decisions \naddressing Rule 59(e) to suggest its approach is \nconsistent with the law of other Circuits.  See BIO.21-\n23 (discussing Metzler Investment Gmbh v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2020) and \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam)).  But whether those earlier cases are \nconsistent with other Circuits\u2019 Rule 59(e) cases does \nnot alter the fact that the Second Circuit\u2019s treatment \nof Rule 60(b) motions seeking to replead sharply \nconflicts with the decisions of every other Circuit \napplying Rule 60(b).  On that latter issue, which is the \nquestion presented here, the Second Circuit has \nabandoned the extraordinary-circumstances standard \nto require district courts \u201cto consider Rule 60(b) \nfinality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  \nPet.App.7.  In other words, it has forbade district \ncourts from analyzing Rule 60(b) motions \u201cunder only \nRule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat clashes with the otherwise unanimous view of \nthe Courts of Appeals, which have consistently held \nthat plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \n1 Rather than confront the Fourth Circuit\u2019s thoughtful analysis \nin Daulatzai, Respondents suggest the Fourth Circuit must have \nbeen aware of the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in Mandala and \nHonickman.  BIO.23.  But the Second Circuit issued its mistaken \nopinions after Daulatzai was argued on October 24, 2023.  And \nthe docket in Daulatzai reflects that neither party filed a Rule \n28(j) letter bringing either Mandala or this case to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s attention.  It is thus no surprise that the Fourth Circuit \ndid not mention the Second Circuit\u2019s erroneous decisions. \n\n8 \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before\u201d \ninvoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  In re \nFerro Corp. Deriv. Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Ewing v. 1645 \nW. Farragut LLC, 90 F.4th 876, 893 (7th Cir. 2024); \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017); Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 \nF.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. 2003); Cooper v. Shumway, 780 \nF.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThis Court should thus grant certiorari to remedy \nthe split and confirm that losing litigants may not \ndeploy the policies of Rule 15(a) to bypass Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nexacting requirements for relief. \nII. Respondents\u2019 Reliance On Foman Only \nReinforces The Fundament Flaws In The \nSecond Circuit\u2019s Approach.  \nNot only are Respondents\u2019 efforts to obscure the \ncircuit split unavailing, but their attempt to defend \nthe \ndecision \nbelow \nonly \nfurther \nreveals \nthe \nfundamental legal error in the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier \napproach.  Respondents rely principally on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Foman, and they emphasize that \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s precedents have done the same.  \nBut Foman is categorically inapt, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s reliance on it was the very legal error that \ncaused it to split with every other Circuit and violate \nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents.   \nCritically, the Foman decision did not address a \nRule 60(b)(6) motion.  This court instead recognized \nthe motion \u201cas one under Rule 59(e).\u201d  371 U.S. at 181.  \nAs a result, Foman is simply irrelevant to this case.  \n\n9 \nRather, the controlling precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a Rule \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at 536.  Respondents and \nthe Second Circuit thus have the analysis backwards. \nIndeed, \nin \nBanister \nv. \nDavis, \nthis \nCourt \nemphasized the critical distinctions between Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b).  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-\ntime effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued \ndecision to a [district] court\u2019s attention, before taking \na single appeal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 521.  Accordingly, the \ntime for bringing a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis short\u201428 \ndays from entry of the judgment, with no possibility of \nan extension.\u201d  Id.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding,\u201d a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201c\u2018suspend[s] the finality\u2019 of any judgment.\u201d  Id. \nat 514 (cleaned up).  By contrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) \nmotion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always \ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already \ncompleted judgment.\u201d  Id. at 520-21.  Rather than \n\u201caid[ing] the trial court to get its decision right in the \nfirst instance,\u201d a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cserve[s] to \ncollaterally attack [an] already completed judgment.\u201d  \nId. at 518-19. It therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id.\nAnd for that reason, the \u201cstandard for granting a Rule \n59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d than \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  Daulatzai, 97 \nF.4th at 177.  In short, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule \n59(e) in just about every way that matters to the \ninquiry here.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 518; see \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177-78.   \n\n10 \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach fails to grasp these \ncrucial differences.  Instead, it wrongly treats Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions as fungible, and then \nrelies on Foman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard \nto override the strict requirements of Rule 60(b)(6) set \nforth in Gonzalez.  Thus, Respondents\u2019 effort to chide \nBLOM for not citing Foman only confirms that their \napproach\u2014which the Second Circuit adopted\u2014\nobliterates the critical distinction between Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b)(6).  No other Circuit has adopted that \ncategory error.  To the contrary, they have all rejected \nit.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in \nDaulatzai thoroughly debunks it.   \nMoreover, even if Foman somehow applied, the \nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion clearly \nsatisfied its requirements.  In Foman, this Court held \nonly that \u201coutright refusal to grant [plaintiffs] leave \n[to amend] without any justifying reason\u201d is an abuse \nof discretion.  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, the District Court \nprovided multiple reasons for its denial.  For starters, \nRespondents \u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all \nlegal avenues available to them for relief,\u201d yet they \nengaged in a \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe \ndeficiencies \nidentified \nin \ntheir \npleading.\u201d  \nPet.App.16; Pet.App.19.  In addition, the District \nCourt dismissed their complaint with prejudice, and \nthat decision was affirmed based on one of the grounds \nidentified by the District Court.  Pet.App.13; \nPet.App.15 n.3.  During the appeal, Respondents \nnever challenged the District Court\u2019s decision to \ndismiss with prejudice, and they never requested leave \nto \namend\u2014even \nduring \nsupplemental \nbriefing \nfollowing the Second Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in \nKaplan.  Pet.10-11.  And, even to the extent the \n\n11 \nSecond Circuit \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201d the law in its decision, the \nDistrict Court explained that \u201ca mere change in \ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nPet.App.14 (citation omitted); accord Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997) (\u201cIntervening \ndevelopments in the law by themselves rarely \nconstitute the extraordinary circumstances required \nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(6)[.]\u201d). \nIII. This \nCase \nDoes \nNot \nArise \nIn \nAn \nInterlocutory Posture. \nFaced with an undeniable circuit split and patently \nincorrect decision, Respondents attempt to label the \ndecision below \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to suggest that this case \npresents a \u201cpoor vehicle\u201d for review.  BIO.1; BIO.18-\n19; BIO.28.  But that is wrong as well.  Far from being \ninterlocutory, there is undeniably a final judgment in \nthis action.  See Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), aff\u2019d, 6 F.4th 487 (2d \nCir. 2021).  Indeed, this appeal exists only because \nRespondents have sought to vacate that final \njudgment.  Respondents also ignore that an order \ndenying a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cappealed as \u2018a \nseparate final order.\u2019\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 520 \n(quoting Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 401 (1995)).  And \nthey do not dispute that reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision would finally end this case for good.  There is \nthus nothing interlocutory about this appeal. \nWhat Respondents seem to really mean is that \nBLOM may still win yet again on remand.  On that \nbasis, Respondents suggest that review now may be \nunnecessary and inefficient.  BIO.18.  But that \nassertion is indicative of Respondents\u2019 abusive \n\n12 \nattitude toward the Federal Rules.  After Respondents \ndeclined multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint, BLOM secured dismissal with prejudice.  \nRather than move at that time to amend under Rule \n59(e), Respondents chose to appeal.  Even during \nsupplemental briefing on appeal, Respondents never \nasked the Second Circuit to remand so they could \nreplead.  And when the Second Circuit affirmed, \nRespondents did not seek rehearing.  Instead, they \nfiled a Rule 60(b)(6) motion that sought to start the \nprocess all over again\u2014on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts (of which they were \npreviously aware) in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  Applying this Court\u2019s standards under Rule \n60(b)(6), the District Court properly denied the \nmotion.  Had the Second Circuit similarly applied Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014or had this case arisen in any other \nCircuit\u2014this loop of relitigation would already be \nover.   \nRather than allow this inefficient distortion of the \nFederal Rules to continue, this Court should grant \nreview and restore uniformity in the law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in \nBLOM\u2019s Petition, certiorari should be granted. \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

As the Opening Brief \nexplained, that outlier approach lacks any basis in \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or context.  It puts Rule 60(b) at \nwar with itself on multiple fronts.  It subverts the \nguiding principles of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  And it contradicts this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThose decisions confirm that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022).  \u201cEven then, \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nmust justify [the] reopening\u201d of a final judgment.  Id. \n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11 (1988)).  And a party\u2019s \u201cfree, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 \n(1950).  Rather, the party must be wholly \u201cfaultless in \nthe delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993). \nRespondents largely ignore these foundational \nprinciples.  That is because they cannot salvage the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s backwards approach or the mess it \nwould make of Rule 60(b) and the Federal Rules more \nbroadly.  Instead, Respondents try to avoid the Second \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, insisting that the court did not \nactually \u201c\u2018jettison\u2019 the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard\u201d and, in fact, \u201cd[id] not \u2018hold\u2019 anything.\u201d  \nResp.Br.22, 25 (citation omitted). \nThey are wrong on both points.  The Second Circuit \nexpressly abandoned the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard, and it held that the District Court erred by \napplying it.  In doing so, the Second Circuit \n\n2 \n \nacknowledged that a \u201cplaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \nRule 60(b)(6) relief \u2018only when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying relief.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  \u201cBut,\u201d according to the \nSecond Circuit, the standard changes when \u201c\u2018vacatur \nis sought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023)).  In that \ncase, the Second Circuit believed that \u201c\u2018special \nconsiderations come into play\u2019\u201d that \u201crequire[] [district \ncourts] to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem.\u201d  Id. (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 361).  Based on that mistaken view of the Federal \nRules, the Second Circuit held that the District Court \nabused its discretion by evaluating Respondents\u2019 Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nThis Court should reverse and hold that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when it \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar to deny relief.  Indeed, \nRespondents\u2019 \nsuggestion \nthat \nextraordinary \ncircumstances exist here only underscores the \nproblems with the Second Circuit\u2019s test.  Everything \nthey point to sounds in \u201cmistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  \nAs a result, Rule 60(b)(6) relief is categorically \nunavailable to them.  Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s one-year deadline \ninstead applies\u2014and it expired before Respondents \nfiled their motion. \nRespondents\u2019 repeated and deliberate waivers also \nforeclose post-judgment relief.  They do not dispute \n\u201cthat they twice declined the opportunity to amend \ntheir Complaint before [the District] Court dismissed \nit,\u201d only to then \u201cwaive[]\u201d any challenge to the \u201c\u2018with \n\n3 \n \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal\u201d on appeal.  \nPet.App.16 & n.4.  Nor do they dispute that it would \nhave been \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d for the lower courts \nto \u201coverride a [litigant\u2019s] deliberate waiver.\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  That should be the end of the matter.  \nRespondents chose to stand or fall on their complaint \nas pled and unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.   \nRespondents gloss over these facts by claiming that \n\u201cthe Second Circuit did not find any waiver.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court did, and the Second \nCircuit nowhere disagreed.  It nonetheless refused to \nuphold the District Court\u2019s decision\u2014notwithstanding \nthe waivers\u2014because the District Court had not given \n\u201cdue regard\u201d to \u201cthe liberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  \nThat was error.  Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d of \ntheir litigation choices merely \u201cbecause hindsight \nseems to indicate\u201d that those decisions were ill-\nadvised.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199.  Thus, Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201chas no application to [this] situation.\u201d  Id. at \n202.  And, because a final judgment is in place, neither \ndoes Rule 15(a). \nThis Court should reverse the decision below, \nreinstate the District Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 \nRule 60(b) motion, and bring this case to an end. \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must Satisfy \nRule 60(b)\u2019s Stringent Standards. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test dilutes Rule \n60(b)\u2019s exacting requirements for post-judgment relief \nwithout any basis in text, context, or precedent.  \nRespondents ignore the glaring problems with that \napproach.  And their arguments only highlight the \nflaws in the decision below. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires \u201cExtraordinary \nCircumstances\u201d Not Covered by Any Other \nProvision of Rule 60(b). \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have \nbeen analyzed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard.  This \nCourt has consistently \u201crequired a movant seeking \nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 \n(2005) (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.Br.23 (collecting cases).  This Court has also long \nstressed that Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d \nwith the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b).  \nLiljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  The Rule\u2019s text and \nstructure dictate both of these principles.  See \nPet.Br.23, 27-28, 31-34.  Yet the decision below flouts \nthem.  And Respondents provide no basis to discard \nthese basic requirements where plaintiffs seek to \nrevive their case with an amended complaint. \nPerhaps recognizing the Second Circuit\u2019s misstep, \nRespondents start off by suggesting that the court did \nnot \u201cabandon[] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \n\n5 \n \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry.\u201d  \nResp.Br.24 (citation omitted).  But that is wrong.  The \ndecision below rebuked the \u201cordinar[y]\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) \nstandard for one that \u201cbalance[s] Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Pet.App.8 (holding \nthat the District Court\u2019s extraordinary circumstances \n\u201cframework for analyzing [Respondents\u2019] motion was \nerroneous as a matter of law\u201d). \nThat analytical mistake was compelled by Second \nCircuit \nprecedent. \n \nIn \nMandala, \nthe \ncourt \nacknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test.  \n88 F.4th at 361.  But then it cast that standard aside \nto hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to amend, a district \ncourt abuses its discretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment \nrelief\u201d based solely on the movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to \ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief under Rule \n60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  That makes no sense.  As Judge \nSullivan countered in his Mandala dissent, \u201cit is \nbeyond cavil that a party\u2019s failure to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances is alone a sufficient \njustification for denying postjudgment relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 369 n.2 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  \nThat is, after all, the standard for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  \nAnd it is the standard that should have applied here. \nRespondents then later pull an about face, \nacknowledging that the Second Circuit did apply a \n\u201cbalancing test\u201d that imports \u201cthe policies embodied in \nRule 15(a)\u201d into the vacatur analysis.  Resp.Br.25 \n(quotation marks omitted).  But they offer no \npersuasive defense of that misguided approach. \n\n6 \n \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Balancing Test \nLacks Any Precedential Support. \nRespondents cannot ground the Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test in the text or context of Rule 60(b)(6).  \nAccordingly, \nthey \nspend \nover \na \ndozen \npages \nmeandering through caselaw (at 25-38) in an effort to \ndownplay the novelty of that outlier position.  But they \nconcede that other decisions are \u201cout of step\u201d with the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  Resp.Br.33.  And \nRespondents do not rely on any case that helps them. \nRespondents fumble (at 27) for support in Krupski \nv. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538 (2010).  But \nthat case addressed the scope of \u201crelation back under \nRule 15(c)(1)(C),\u201d as defined by \u201cthe text of the Rule.\u201d  \nId. at 541, 547.  Krupski said nothing about the proper \nstandard for reopening a judgment under Rule 60(b).  \nThat is the Rule that governs \u201cRelief from a Final \nJudgment, Order, or Proceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nRespondents also double down (at 26-27) on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But they concede that \ncase involved a motion \u201cunder Rule 59(e), not Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Resp.Br.27 n.3.  As explained in the Opening \nBrief, that distinction matters.  See Pet.Br.34-35.  And \nwhile Respondents try to characterize the specific rule \nin Foman as \u201ccompletely irrelevant to this Court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d Resp.Br.27 n.3, that is not true.  The proper \nstandard for a Rule 60(b) motion was not before the \nFoman Court, and Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) impose \n\u201cdifferent standards\u201d for relief \u201cby their own terms.\u201d  \nDaulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. \n2024).  Hence, the Rule 59(e) motion in Foman was \n\u201cnot controlled by the same exacting substantive \nrequirements\u201d codified in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  Priester v. \n\n7 \n \nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 927 F.3d 912, 913 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   \nNor is it surprising that the standards would differ \nbetween the two rules.  They serve markedly different \nfunctions.  A Rule 59(e) motion operates as \u201ca limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding\u201d and plays \u201ca \npart [in] producing the final judgment,\u201d whereas a \nRule 60(b) motion \u201cthreaten[s] an already final \njudgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 519, 521 (2020); see Pet.Br.34-35.  \nRule 60(b) thus naturally poses a higher bar for relief. \nRespondents next trumpet (at 29-31, 33, 35-38) a \nparade of lower court decisions.  But those cases, \nobviously, do not control this Court\u2019s analysis.  And \nmost of them similarly addressed Rule 59(e) motions, \nnot Rule 60(b) motions.1  So, they are simply off-point \nas well.  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are not fungible, and \nRespondents fail to offer any reason to merge the two \ntextually and functionally distinct rules into one. \nNor do any of the few 60(b) cases that Respondents \nlean on (at 29-30) provide them any support.  Those \ndecisions merely recognize that the Rules\u2019 drafters \nalready balanced the needs for \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \n \n1  See, e.g., Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. \n& Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 2015); NewSpin Sports, \nLLC v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d 293, 299 (7th Cir. 2018); \nUnited States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investigations, LLC v. \nVictaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 248-49 (3d Cir. 2016); Jang v. Bos. \nSci. Scimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013); Rosenzweig v. \nAzurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863-64 (5th Cir. 2003); Firestone v. \nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996); S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993); see also \nAllen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, 184 (5th Cir. 2018). \n\n8 \n \nin Rule 60(b) itself.  Phelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, \n1133 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  None suggests \nthat courts should then smuggle in Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading principles as an additional variable to tip \nthe scales against finality under Rule 60(b).  The \nSecond Circuit stands alone by imposing that \nextratextual requirement.2 \nRespondents also rely heavily on United States v. \nMask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nBut that was a Rule 60(b)(1) case, not a Rule 60(b)(6) \ncase.  See id. at 743.  And it only further illustrates \nwhy Respondents are wrong here.  Like every other \nCourt of Appeals, see Pet.Br.21 n.3, the Eighth Circuit \nthere held that courts may grant leave to amend only \nif doing so \u201cis consistent with the stringent standards \ngoverning the grant of . . . Rule 60(b) relief,\u201d 752 F.3d \n \n2  Other decisions cited by Respondents do not address either \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions.  See, e.g., Gondeck v. Pan Am. \nWorld Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, 26-28 (1965); Jack v. Evonik \nCorp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 (5th Cir. 2023); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015); Calvary Christian Ctr. \nv. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 539-41 (4th Cir. 2013); \nUnited States ex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 \n(9th Cir. 2011); Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d \n787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 2004); Duggins v. Steak \u2019n Shake, Inc., 195 \nF.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999); Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d \n557, 559-60 (6th Cir. 1986); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l \nUnion, AFL-CIO v. Delta Refin. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. \n1960); Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 F.2d 349, 351 (D.C. \nCir. 1950).  Nor do any of them deal with circumstances like \nthese, in which Respondents engaged in a \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies identified in their \npleading\u201d prior to dismissal.  Pet.App.19; cf. Foster v. DeLuca, 545 \nF.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008) (no waiver by plaintiff, who filed a \ncombined Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motion just a week after the \ndistrict court terminated the case without warning). \n\n9 \n \nat 743.  It then affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of \npost-judgment relief where, as here, the plaintiff \n\u201cknew many months prior to the Order of Dismissal of \nthe possible need to amend its pleading and elected to \n\u2018stand or fall\u2019\u201d on its complaint.  Id. at 744; see \nPet.App.15-18.  The Second Circuit should have \nreached the same result. \nFinally, Respondents cobble together (at 37) a trio \nof this Court\u2019s precedents that have nothing to do with \nthe question presented in this case.  None even \nmentions Rule 60(b), let alone purports to analyze the \nproper standard for a plaintiff seeking relief from a \nfinal judgment.  Nor did they have occasion to do so.  \nIn Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 \nU.S. 308, 329 (2007), this Court merely remanded for \napplication of a legal standard to the facts alleged.  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 666 (2009), this Court \nconfronted an \u201cinterlocutory appeal,\u201d not an appeal \nfrom a final judgment.  And in Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014), this Court \u201creversed\u201d \nan improper dismissal, meaning there was no longer a \nfinal judgment on remand. \nHere, by contrast, Respondents seek to set aside a \ndismissal with prejudice that was affirmed on appeal.  \nPet.App.49-53.  A final judgment remains in place.  \nThus, Respondents must \u201csatisfy one of the Rule 60(b) \ngrounds before [the] court may consider [a] motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 178.  \u201cThe permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant\u201d until they make that showing.  Garrett \nv. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019).  The \nSecond Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \n\n10 \n \n2. Respondents\u2019 Other Arguments Are \nMeritless. \nBeyond citing inapposite precedents, Respondents \nsay little else to defend the decision below.  They do \nnot suggest that the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nfinds any support in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  They do not rely \non the Rule\u2019s history or structure.  They do not dispute \nthat the decision below thwarts the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nAnd they do not explain how it is \u201cjust\u201d to relieve \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices\u2014which \nwould burden both defendants and the courts with \nduplicative litigation.  Id.; see Pet.Br.37; Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 369 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). \nNor do Respondents grapple with the many ways \nin which the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test clashes \nwith other provisions of Rule 60(b).  See Pet.Br.31-34.  \nThey do not dispute that it enables plaintiffs to evade \nRule 60\u2019s strict time limitations where allegations are \nomitted by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), \n(c)(1).  Nor do they explain why plaintiffs could wield \nRule 60(b)(6) to introduce previously available facts \nyears after judgment, when Rule 60 elsewhere limits \nrelief to matters \u201cnewly discovered\u201d within a year of \njudgment that \u201ccould not have been discovered\u201d before \nwith \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test invites that internal \ninconsistency.  See Mandala, 88 F.4th at 365 (ordering \nvacatur and amendment \u201cbased on information that \nwas publicly available for years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint\u201d). \nAs to mistake, Respondents claim that \u201cthe Second \nCircuit has never suggested that vacatur and \n\n11 \n \namendment are permissible where a complaint failed \ndue to counsel\u2019s mistake.\u201d  Resp.Br.43.  But, even \nsetting aside the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) is not limited \nto counsel\u2019s mistakes, see Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534-35, \nthe Second Circuit has required just that.  It deployed \nits balancing test in Mandala to compel the reopening \nof a final judgment, even though the \u201cvacatur motion \nar[ose] from a legal mistake based on insufficient \npleading.\u201d  88 F.4th at 360.  That is precisely \nRespondents\u2019 theory here too\u2014that they made a legal \nmistake as to which facts they needed to allege to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s statutory standard.  See Resp.Br.45.3 \nRetreating from Rule 60(b), Respondents note that \nRule 15 \u201ccontemplates two stages of amendment\u2014\nbefore trial and during or after trial.\u201d  Resp.Br.42.  Yet, \nthey fail to explain why that might bear on the \nthreshold vacatur inquiry, which necessarily occurs in \nthe post-judgment context.

And \nRespondents concede \u201cthat Rule 15(a) \u2018does not \nprovide a mechanism for amending pleadings after \ndismissal.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.42 (quoting Pet.Br.30).  Rather, \nRule 60(b) defines the \u201climited set of circumstances\u201d \nthat might allow the losing party to \u201crequest \nreopening of his case.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  \n \n3  To be clear, Respondents\u2019 proposed amendments still \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n1: 20250207164739436_23-125920Affidavit.json (score: 0.366)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-1259 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nBLOM BANK SAL, \n \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nMICHAL HONICKMAN, et al., \n \nRespondents, \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK  \n) \n  \n                   \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK \n) \n \nI, Ann Tosel, being duly sworn according to law and being over the age \nof 18, upon my oath depose and say that: \n \nI am retained by Counsel of Record for Petitioner. \n \nThat on the 7th day of February, 2025, I served the within Reply Brief \nfor Petitioner in the above-captioned matter upon: \n \nMichael Jacob Radine \nOsen LLC \n190 Moore Street, Suite 272 \nHackensack, NJ 07601 \n201-265-6400 \nmradine@osenlaw.com \nCounsel for Respondents \n \nby sending three copies of same, addressed to each individual respectively, \nthrough Overnight FedEx.

Respondents do not seriously \ndispute that the Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule \n60(b)\u2019s stringent standard places it on the short end of \na lopsided circuit split.  In fact, Respondents entirely \nignore the conflicting decisions of several Courts of \nAppeals.  And they get no further with their efforts to \ndistinguish a few bricks in the wall of precedents from \nevery other Circuit that has rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier approach.  Those decisions make clear \nthat the Second Circuit is now \u201calone in the Nation in \ncollapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard \nfor Rule 15(a).\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, \n177 (4th Cir. 2024). \nRespondents similarly do not dispute that, \u201c[t]o \njustify relief under [Rule 60(b)(6)], a party must show \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 suggesting that the \nparty is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  Nor do \nthey dispute that, in this case, their repeated decisions \nnot to amend were \u201cfree, calculated, [and] deliberate.\u201d  \nAckermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).  \nThat should foreclose the extraordinary relief \nRespondents seek here.  \nInstead, Respondents\u2019 primary response is to fault \nthe Petition for not discussing Foman v. Davis, 371 \nU.S. 178 (1962).  But there is a very good reason for \nthat:  Foman involved a Rule 59(e) motion, while this \ncase concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  Indeed, \n\n2 \nthis Court recently emphasized that very point in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), when it refused \nto conflate the two Rules in the habeas context.  Thus, \nFoman\u2019s discussion of Rule 59(e) does not affect the \nRule 60(b)(6) analysis here.   \nInstead, the relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s decisions squarely conflict with Gonzalez by \neschewing Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent rule in favor of a \n\u201cliberal repleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  No other \nCircuit has adopted that misguided approach.   \nUnable to wash away the circuit split or the Second \nCircuit\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedent, \nRespondents try to ward off review by labeling this \ncase \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d  But that is patently incorrect.  \nThis appeal arises from Respondents\u2019 attempt to \nvacate a final judgment that was entered nearly five \nyears ago.  And the ruling denying that motion was \nitself a final order.  Relief from this Court would thus \nfinally end this case, while denying review would \nthwart the efficiency and finality principles that \nanimate the Federal Rules. \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s unprecedented \ndilution of Rule 60(b)(6) conflicts with this Court\u2019s \ndecisions and those of every other Circuit.  It threatens \nto undermine the finality of judgments.  It encourages \nwasteful litigation tactics.  And, as a matter of law, the \ndecision below is simply wrong.  This Court should \ngrant review and reverse.   \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Approach Conflicts \nWith That Of Eleven Other Circuits.  \nRespondents concede the existence of a circuit split \nby failing to address the conflicting decisions \nPetitioner identified from the First, Third, Eighth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Although Respondents \ncherry-pick quotes from some of the others, a review \nof those decisions confirms an irreconcilable split \nbetween the Second Circuit\u2019s newly developed test for \nRule 60(b) motions and the correct test used in the rest \nof the Courts of Appeals. \nA. Respondents Concede that a Circuit Split \nExists.   \nRespondents \ncompletely \nignore \nthen-Judge \nBreyer\u2019s decision for the First Circuit in James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71 (1983).  There, as here, the First \nCircuit confronted a district court\u2019s denial of a post-\njudgment motion to amend a dismissed complaint.  Id. \nat 77.  In affirming, then-Judge Breyer explained that \n\u201cto require the district court to permit amendment \nhere would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to \njudgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the case by \namending their complaint to take account of the \ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 78.  The First Circuit rebuked \nthat approach because it \u201cwould dramatically \nundermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of \njudicial decisions.\u201d  Id.  That reasoning flatly \ncontradicts the \u201cliberal amendment policy\u201d endorsed \nby the Second Circuit.  Pet.App.7.  But Respondents \ndo not even acknowledge the case. \n\n4 \nRespondents also ignore the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d \nCir. 2019).  In Garrett, the Third Circuit explained \nthat, when a party seeks \u201cto reopen a final judgment, \nthe policy favoring the finality of judgments\u201d is \nimplicated, and \u201c[t]he permissive policy favoring \namendment under Rule 15 [is] simply not relevant.\u201d  \nId. at 86.  Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the post-judgment context, \nthe narrow grounds for relief set forth\u201d in Rule 60(b) \n\u201cmust guide a District Court\u2019s decision about whether \nan otherwise-final judgment should  be disturbed.\u201d  Id.\nThe Third Circuit therefore recognizes\u2014unlike the \nSecond Circuit\u2014that \u201ca different set of rules \nemphasizing vastly different policies\u201d pertain to a \nmotion seeking to vacate a final judgment for the \npurposes of amending a complaint.  Id.\nRespondents likewise ignore the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in MacPhee v. MiMedx Grp., Inc., 73 F.4th \n1220 (11th Cir. 2023).  As in this case, the district \ncourt there denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for post-\njudgment vacatur-for-amendment, \u201cexplaining that \nbecause [the plaintiff] waited until after judgment was \nentered to seek such relief, Rule 15(a) did not apply.\u201d  \nId. at 1238.  Unless the plaintiff could first show \n\u201centitle[ment] to relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d it \n\u201cwas not entitled to leave to amend post-judgment.\u201d  \nId.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, embracing this \nrestrictive approach even \u201cwhere the plaintiff has not \nexercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as a \nmatter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250.  Again, that is directly \nat odds with the Second Circuit\u2019s belief that plaintiffs \nneed not \u201cnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before \nthey [can] invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading \n\n5 \npolicy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And, again, Respondents \nconspicuously fail to address it.  \nThe same goes for UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 \nF.4th 1047 (8th Cir. 2024).  As the Eighth Circuit held \nthere, \u201cthe liberal amendment standard in Rule \n15(a)(2) does not govern\u201d for post-judgment motions \nseeking to amend a complaint.  Id. at 1057. Instead, \n\u201ca more restrictive standard reflecting interests of \nfinality applies.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  That is, \n\u201c[l]eave to amend will be granted if\u201d\u2014and only if\u2014\u201cit \nis consistent with the stringent standards governing \nthe grant of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  Id.\n(cleaned up).  Respondents once again ignore this \ndecision, which squarely conflicts with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement that district courts \u201cbalance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Mandala v. \nNTT Data, 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023).   \nRespondents similarly ignore the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for \nunsuccessful litigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. \nGates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To be sure, \nRespondents obliquely note that the D.C. Circuit has \nallowed \npost-judgment \namendment \nin \n\u201ccertain \ncircumstances.\u201d  BIO.27.  But those are where the \nmovant has \u201cprevailed on the claim in question.\u201d  Bldg. \nIndus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nRespondents\u2019 claims were dismissed with prejudice, \nand that dismissal was affirmed on appeal.  \n\n6 \nIn short, by their own omissions, Respondents \nconcede the decision below conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. \nCircuits.  That alone should warrant review. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Discussion of Other Circuit \nDecisions \nConfirms \nthat \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit Has Adopted an Outlier Approach. \nThe circuit split extends far beyond the cases \nRespondents ignore.   \nMost notably, in Daulatzai, the Fourth Circuit \nspecifically rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in a \nthoroughly reasoned opinion.   See 97 F.4th at 180.  \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial \nof a Rule 60(b) motion.  In so doing, the Fourth Circuit \nconfronted the exact error that the Second Circuit \ncommitted in Mandala and this case.  It expressly \n\u201creject[ed] \nDaulatzai\u2019s \nargument\u201d \nthat \nearlier \nprecedents \u201ccollapsing . . . the standards under Rule \n59(e) and Rule 15(a) should also apply when the \nmotion seeks relief from the judgment under Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphases added).  Thus, unlike the \nSecond Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has correctly held \nthat, \u201cwhen the motion to vacate is filed under Rule \n60(b), the more restrictive standard for granting that \nmotion must be satisfied before consideration can be \ngiven to the motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphasis \nadded).  By contrast, the Second Circuit here faulted \nthe District Court for \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \nvacate and amend as calling for two distinct analyses\u201d \nunder Rule 60(b) and then Rule 15(a).  Pet.App.7-8; see \n\n7 \nalso Mandala 88 F.4th at 361.  The two approaches \nare impossible to square.1\nRespondents only further underscore this error by \ntrying to leverage a pair of Second Circuit decisions \naddressing Rule 59(e) to suggest its approach is \nconsistent with the law of other Circuits.  See BIO.21-\n23 (discussing Metzler Investment Gmbh v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2020) and \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam)).  But whether those earlier cases are \nconsistent with other Circuits\u2019 Rule 59(e) cases does \nnot alter the fact that the Second Circuit\u2019s treatment \nof Rule 60(b) motions seeking to replead sharply \nconflicts with the decisions of every other Circuit \napplying Rule 60(b).  On that latter issue, which is the \nquestion presented here, the Second Circuit has \nabandoned the extraordinary-circumstances standard \nto require district courts \u201cto consider Rule 60(b) \nfinality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  \nPet.App.7.  In other words, it has forbade district \ncourts from analyzing Rule 60(b) motions \u201cunder only \nRule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat clashes with the otherwise unanimous view of \nthe Courts of Appeals, which have consistently held \nthat plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \n1 Rather than confront the Fourth Circuit\u2019s thoughtful analysis \nin Daulatzai, Respondents suggest the Fourth Circuit must have \nbeen aware of the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in Mandala and \nHonickman.  BIO.23.  But the Second Circuit issued its mistaken \nopinions after Daulatzai was argued on October 24, 2023.  And \nthe docket in Daulatzai reflects that neither party filed a Rule \n28(j) letter bringing either Mandala or this case to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s attention.  It is thus no surprise that the Fourth Circuit \ndid not mention the Second Circuit\u2019s erroneous decisions. \n\n8 \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before\u201d \ninvoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.

Shumway, 780 \nF.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThis Court should thus grant certiorari to remedy \nthe split and confirm that losing litigants may not \ndeploy the policies of Rule 15(a) to bypass Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nexacting requirements for relief. \nII. Respondents\u2019 Reliance On Foman Only \nReinforces The Fundament Flaws In The \nSecond Circuit\u2019s Approach.  \nNot only are Respondents\u2019 efforts to obscure the \ncircuit split unavailing, but their attempt to defend \nthe \ndecision \nbelow \nonly \nfurther \nreveals \nthe \nfundamental legal error in the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier \napproach.  Respondents rely principally on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Foman, and they emphasize that \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s precedents have done the same.  \nBut Foman is categorically inapt, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s reliance on it was the very legal error that \ncaused it to split with every other Circuit and violate \nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents.   \nCritically, the Foman decision did not address a \nRule 60(b)(6) motion.  This court instead recognized \nthe motion \u201cas one under Rule 59(e).\u201d  371 U.S. at 181.  \nAs a result, Foman is simply irrelevant to this case.  \n\n9 \nRather, the controlling precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a Rule \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at 536.  Respondents and \nthe Second Circuit thus have the analysis backwards. \nIndeed, \nin \nBanister \nv. \nDavis, \nthis \nCourt \nemphasized the critical distinctions between Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b).  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-\ntime effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued \ndecision to a [district] court\u2019s attention, before taking \na single appeal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 521.  Accordingly, the \ntime for bringing a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis short\u201428 \ndays from entry of the judgment, with no possibility of \nan extension.\u201d  Id.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding,\u201d a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201c\u2018suspend[s] the finality\u2019 of any judgment.\u201d  Id. \nat 514 (cleaned up).  By contrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) \nmotion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always \ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already \ncompleted judgment.\u201d  Id. at 520-21.  Rather than \n\u201caid[ing] the trial court to get its decision right in the \nfirst instance,\u201d a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cserve[s] to \ncollaterally attack [an] already completed judgment.\u201d  \nId. at 518-19. It therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id.\nAnd for that reason, the \u201cstandard for granting a Rule \n59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d than \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  Daulatzai, 97 \nF.4th at 177.  In short, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule \n59(e) in just about every way that matters to the \ninquiry here.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 518; see \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177-78.   \n\n10 \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach fails to grasp these \ncrucial differences.  Instead, it wrongly treats Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions as fungible, and then \nrelies on Foman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard \nto override the strict requirements of Rule 60(b)(6) set \nforth in Gonzalez.  Thus, Respondents\u2019 effort to chide \nBLOM for not citing Foman only confirms that their \napproach\u2014which the Second Circuit adopted\u2014\nobliterates the critical distinction between Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b)(6).  No other Circuit has adopted that \ncategory error.  To the contrary, they have all rejected \nit.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in \nDaulatzai thoroughly debunks it.   \nMoreover, even if Foman somehow applied, the \nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion clearly \nsatisfied its requirements.  In Foman, this Court held \nonly that \u201coutright refusal to grant [plaintiffs] leave \n[to amend] without any justifying reason\u201d is an abuse \nof discretion.  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, the District Court \nprovided multiple reasons for its denial.  For starters, \nRespondents \u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all \nlegal avenues available to them for relief,\u201d yet they \nengaged in a \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe \ndeficiencies \nidentified \nin \ntheir \npleading.\u201d  \nPet.App.16; Pet.App.19.  In addition, the District \nCourt dismissed their complaint with prejudice, and \nthat decision was affirmed based on one of the grounds \nidentified by the District Court.  Pet.App.13; \nPet.App.15 n.3.  During the appeal, Respondents \nnever challenged the District Court\u2019s decision to \ndismiss with prejudice, and they never requested leave \nto \namend\u2014even \nduring \nsupplemental \nbriefing \nfollowing the Second Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in \nKaplan.  Pet.10-11.  And, even to the extent the \n\n11 \nSecond Circuit \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201d the law in its decision, the \nDistrict Court explained that \u201ca mere change in \ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nPet.App.14 (citation omitted); accord Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997) (\u201cIntervening \ndevelopments in the law by themselves rarely \nconstitute the extraordinary circumstances required \nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(6)[.]\u201d). \nIII. This \nCase \nDoes \nNot \nArise \nIn \nAn \nInterlocutory Posture. \nFaced with an undeniable circuit split and patently \nincorrect decision, Respondents attempt to label the \ndecision below \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to suggest that this case \npresents a \u201cpoor vehicle\u201d for review.  BIO.1; BIO.18-\n19; BIO.28.  But that is wrong as well.  Far from being \ninterlocutory, there is undeniably a final judgment in \nthis action.  See Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), aff\u2019d, 6 F.4th 487 (2d \nCir. 2021).  Indeed, this appeal exists only because \nRespondents have sought to vacate that final \njudgment.  Respondents also ignore that an order \ndenying a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cappealed as \u2018a \nseparate final order.\u2019\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 520 \n(quoting Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 401 (1995)).  And \nthey do not dispute that reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision would finally end this case for good.  There is \nthus nothing interlocutory about this appeal. \nWhat Respondents seem to really mean is that \nBLOM may still win yet again on remand.  On that \nbasis, Respondents suggest that review now may be \nunnecessary and inefficient.  BIO.18.  But that \nassertion is indicative of Respondents\u2019 abusive \n\n12 \nattitude toward the Federal Rules.  After Respondents \ndeclined multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint, BLOM secured dismissal with prejudice.  \nRather than move at that time to amend under Rule \n59(e), Respondents chose to appeal.  Even during \nsupplemental briefing on appeal, Respondents never \nasked the Second Circuit to remand so they could \nreplead.  And when the Second Circuit affirmed, \nRespondents did not seek rehearing.  Instead, they \nfiled a Rule 60(b)(6) motion that sought to start the \nprocess all over again\u2014on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts (of which they were \npreviously aware) in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  Applying this Court\u2019s standards under Rule \n60(b)(6), the District Court properly denied the \nmotion.  Had the Second Circuit similarly applied Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014or had this case arisen in any other \nCircuit\u2014this loop of relitigation would already be \nover.   \nRather than allow this inefficient distortion of the \nFederal Rules to continue, this Court should grant \nreview and restore uniformity in the law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in \nBLOM\u2019s Petition, certiorari should be granted. \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

As the Opening Brief \nexplained, that outlier approach lacks any basis in \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or context.  It puts Rule 60(b) at \nwar with itself on multiple fronts.  It subverts the \nguiding principles of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  And it contradicts this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThose decisions confirm that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022).  \u201cEven then, \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nmust justify [the] reopening\u201d of a final judgment.  Id. \n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11 (1988)).  And a party\u2019s \u201cfree, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 \n(1950).  Rather, the party must be wholly \u201cfaultless in \nthe delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993). \nRespondents largely ignore these foundational \nprinciples.  That is because they cannot salvage the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s backwards approach or the mess it \nwould make of Rule 60(b) and the Federal Rules more \nbroadly.  Instead, Respondents try to avoid the Second \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, insisting that the court did not \nactually \u201c\u2018jettison\u2019 the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard\u201d and, in fact, \u201cd[id] not \u2018hold\u2019 anything.\u201d  \nResp.Br.22, 25 (citation omitted). \nThey are wrong on both points.  The Second Circuit \nexpressly abandoned the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard, and it held that the District Court erred by \napplying it.  In doing so, the Second Circuit \n\n2 \n \nacknowledged that a \u201cplaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \nRule 60(b)(6) relief \u2018only when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying relief.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  \u201cBut,\u201d according to the \nSecond Circuit, the standard changes when \u201c\u2018vacatur \nis sought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023)).  In that \ncase, the Second Circuit believed that \u201c\u2018special \nconsiderations come into play\u2019\u201d that \u201crequire[] [district \ncourts] to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem.\u201d  Id. (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 361).  Based on that mistaken view of the Federal \nRules, the Second Circuit held that the District Court \nabused its discretion by evaluating Respondents\u2019 Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nThis Court should reverse and hold that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when it \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar to deny relief.  Indeed, \nRespondents\u2019 \nsuggestion \nthat \nextraordinary \ncircumstances exist here only underscores the \nproblems with the Second Circuit\u2019s test.  Everything \nthey point to sounds in \u201cmistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  \nAs a result, Rule 60(b)(6) relief is categorically \nunavailable to them.  Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s one-year deadline \ninstead applies\u2014and it expired before Respondents \nfiled their motion. \nRespondents\u2019 repeated and deliberate waivers also \nforeclose post-judgment relief.  They do not dispute \n\u201cthat they twice declined the opportunity to amend \ntheir Complaint before [the District] Court dismissed \nit,\u201d only to then \u201cwaive[]\u201d any challenge to the \u201c\u2018with \n\n3 \n \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal\u201d on appeal.  \nPet.App.16 & n.4.  Nor do they dispute that it would \nhave been \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d for the lower courts \nto \u201coverride a [litigant\u2019s] deliberate waiver.\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  That should be the end of the matter.  \nRespondents chose to stand or fall on their complaint \nas pled and unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.   \nRespondents gloss over these facts by claiming that \n\u201cthe Second Circuit did not find any waiver.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court did, and the Second \nCircuit nowhere disagreed.  It nonetheless refused to \nuphold the District Court\u2019s decision\u2014notwithstanding \nthe waivers\u2014because the District Court had not given \n\u201cdue regard\u201d to \u201cthe liberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  \nThat was error.  Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d of \ntheir litigation choices merely \u201cbecause hindsight \nseems to indicate\u201d that those decisions were ill-\nadvised.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199.  Thus, Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201chas no application to [this] situation.\u201d  Id. at \n202.  And, because a final judgment is in place, neither \ndoes Rule 15(a). \nThis Court should reverse the decision below, \nreinstate the District Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 \nRule 60(b) motion, and bring this case to an end. \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must Satisfy \nRule 60(b)\u2019s Stringent Standards. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test dilutes Rule \n60(b)\u2019s exacting requirements for post-judgment relief \nwithout any basis in text, context, or precedent.  \nRespondents ignore the glaring problems with that \napproach.  And their arguments only highlight the \nflaws in the decision below. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires \u201cExtraordinary \nCircumstances\u201d Not Covered by Any Other \nProvision of Rule 60(b). \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have \nbeen analyzed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard.  This \nCourt has consistently \u201crequired a movant seeking \nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 \n(2005) (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.Br.23 (collecting cases).  This Court has also long \nstressed that Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d \nwith the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b).  \nLiljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  The Rule\u2019s text and \nstructure dictate both of these principles.  See \nPet.Br.23, 27-28, 31-34.  Yet the decision below flouts \nthem.  And Respondents provide no basis to discard \nthese basic requirements where plaintiffs seek to \nrevive their case with an amended complaint. \nPerhaps recognizing the Second Circuit\u2019s misstep, \nRespondents start off by suggesting that the court did \nnot \u201cabandon[] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \n\n5 \n \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry.\u201d  \nResp.Br.24 (citation omitted).  But that is wrong.  The \ndecision below rebuked the \u201cordinar[y]\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) \nstandard for one that \u201cbalance[s] Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Pet.App.8 (holding \nthat the District Court\u2019s extraordinary circumstances \n\u201cframework for analyzing [Respondents\u2019] motion was \nerroneous as a matter of law\u201d). \nThat analytical mistake was compelled by Second \nCircuit \nprecedent. \n \nIn \nMandala, \nthe \ncourt \nacknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test.  \n88 F.4th at 361.  But then it cast that standard aside \nto hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to amend, a district \ncourt abuses its discretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment \nrelief\u201d based solely on the movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to \ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief under Rule \n60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  That makes no sense.  As Judge \nSullivan countered in his Mandala dissent, \u201cit is \nbeyond cavil that a party\u2019s failure to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances is alone a sufficient \njustification for denying postjudgment relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 369 n.2 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  \nThat is, after all, the standard for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  \nAnd it is the standard that should have applied here. \nRespondents then later pull an about face, \nacknowledging that the Second Circuit did apply a \n\u201cbalancing test\u201d that imports \u201cthe policies embodied in \nRule 15(a)\u201d into the vacatur analysis.  Resp.Br.25 \n(quotation marks omitted).  But they offer no \npersuasive defense of that misguided approach. \n\n6 \n \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Balancing Test \nLacks Any Precedential Support. \nRespondents cannot ground the Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test in the text or context of Rule 60(b)(6).  \nAccordingly, \nthey \nspend \nover \na \ndozen \npages \nmeandering through caselaw (at 25-38) in an effort to \ndownplay the novelty of that outlier position.  But they \nconcede that other decisions are \u201cout of step\u201d with the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  Resp.Br.33.  And \nRespondents do not rely on any case that helps them. \nRespondents fumble (at 27) for support in Krupski \nv. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538 (2010).  But \nthat case addressed the scope of \u201crelation back under \nRule 15(c)(1)(C),\u201d as defined by \u201cthe text of the Rule.\u201d  \nId. at 541, 547.  Krupski said nothing about the proper \nstandard for reopening a judgment under Rule 60(b).  \nThat is the Rule that governs \u201cRelief from a Final \nJudgment, Order, or Proceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nRespondents also double down (at 26-27) on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But they concede that \ncase involved a motion \u201cunder Rule 59(e), not Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Resp.Br.27 n.3.  As explained in the Opening \nBrief, that distinction matters.  See Pet.Br.34-35.  And \nwhile Respondents try to characterize the specific rule \nin Foman as \u201ccompletely irrelevant to this Court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d Resp.Br.27 n.3, that is not true.  The proper \nstandard for a Rule 60(b) motion was not before the \nFoman Court, and Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) impose \n\u201cdifferent standards\u201d for relief \u201cby their own terms.\u201d  \nDaulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. \n2024).  Hence, the Rule 59(e) motion in Foman was \n\u201cnot controlled by the same exacting substantive \nrequirements\u201d codified in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  Priester v. \n\n7 \n \nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 927 F.3d 912, 913 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   \nNor is it surprising that the standards would differ \nbetween the two rules.  They serve markedly different \nfunctions.  A Rule 59(e) motion operates as \u201ca limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding\u201d and plays \u201ca \npart [in] producing the final judgment,\u201d whereas a \nRule 60(b) motion \u201cthreaten[s] an already final \njudgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 519, 521 (2020); see Pet.Br.34-35.  \nRule 60(b) thus naturally poses a higher bar for relief. \nRespondents next trumpet (at 29-31, 33, 35-38) a \nparade of lower court decisions.  But those cases, \nobviously, do not control this Court\u2019s analysis.  And \nmost of them similarly addressed Rule 59(e) motions, \nnot Rule 60(b) motions.1  So, they are simply off-point \nas well.  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are not fungible, and \nRespondents fail to offer any reason to merge the two \ntextually and functionally distinct rules into one. \nNor do any of the few 60(b) cases that Respondents \nlean on (at 29-30) provide them any support.  Those \ndecisions merely recognize that the Rules\u2019 drafters \nalready balanced the needs for \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \n \n1  See, e.g., Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. \n& Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 2015); NewSpin Sports, \nLLC v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d 293, 299 (7th Cir. 2018); \nUnited States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investigations, LLC v. \nVictaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 248-49 (3d Cir. 2016); Jang v. Bos. \nSci. Scimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013); Rosenzweig v. \nAzurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863-64 (5th Cir. 2003); Firestone v. \nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996); S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993); see also \nAllen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, 184 (5th Cir. 2018). \n\n8 \n \nin Rule 60(b) itself.  Phelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, \n1133 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  None suggests \nthat courts should then smuggle in Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading principles as an additional variable to tip \nthe scales against finality under Rule 60(b).  The \nSecond Circuit stands alone by imposing that \nextratextual requirement.2 \nRespondents also rely heavily on United States v. \nMask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nBut that was a Rule 60(b)(1) case, not a Rule 60(b)(6) \ncase.  See id. at 743.  And it only further illustrates \nwhy Respondents are wrong here.  Like every other \nCourt of Appeals, see Pet.Br.21 n.3, the Eighth Circuit \nthere held that courts may grant leave to amend only \nif doing so \u201cis consistent with the stringent standards \ngoverning the grant of . . . Rule 60(b) relief,\u201d 752 F.3d \n \n2  Other decisions cited by Respondents do not address either \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions.  See, e.g., Gondeck v. Pan Am. \nWorld Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, 26-28 (1965); Jack v. Evonik \nCorp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 (5th Cir. 2023); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015); Calvary Christian Ctr. \nv. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 539-41 (4th Cir. 2013); \nUnited States ex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 \n(9th Cir. 2011); Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d \n787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 2004); Duggins v. Steak \u2019n Shake, Inc., 195 \nF.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999); Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d \n557, 559-60 (6th Cir. 1986); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l \nUnion, AFL-CIO v. Delta Refin. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. \n1960); Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 F.2d 349, 351 (D.C. \nCir. 1950).  Nor do any of them deal with circumstances like \nthese, in which Respondents engaged in a \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies identified in their \npleading\u201d prior to dismissal.  Pet.App.19; cf. Foster v. DeLuca, 545 \nF.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008) (no waiver by plaintiff, who filed a \ncombined Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motion just a week after the \ndistrict court terminated the case without warning). \n\n9 \n \nat 743.  It then affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of \npost-judgment relief where, as here, the plaintiff \n\u201cknew many months prior to the Order of Dismissal of \nthe possible need to amend its pleading and elected to \n\u2018stand or fall\u2019\u201d on its complaint.  Id. at 744; see \nPet.App.15-18.  The Second Circuit should have \nreached the same result. \nFinally, Respondents cobble together (at 37) a trio \nof this Court\u2019s precedents that have nothing to do with \nthe question presented in this case.  None even \nmentions Rule 60(b), let alone purports to analyze the \nproper standard for a plaintiff seeking relief from a \nfinal judgment.  Nor did they have occasion to do so.  \nIn Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 \nU.S. 308, 329 (2007), this Court merely remanded for \napplication of a legal standard to the facts alleged.  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 666 (2009), this Court \nconfronted an \u201cinterlocutory appeal,\u201d not an appeal \nfrom a final judgment.  And in Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014), this Court \u201creversed\u201d \nan improper dismissal, meaning there was no longer a \nfinal judgment on remand. \nHere, by contrast, Respondents seek to set aside a \ndismissal with prejudice that was affirmed on appeal.  \nPet.App.49-53.  A final judgment remains in place.  \nThus, Respondents must \u201csatisfy one of the Rule 60(b) \ngrounds before [the] court may consider [a] motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 178.  \u201cThe permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant\u201d until they make that showing.  Garrett \nv. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019).  The \nSecond Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \n\n10 \n \n2. Respondents\u2019 Other Arguments Are \nMeritless. \nBeyond citing inapposite precedents, Respondents \nsay little else to defend the decision below.  They do \nnot suggest that the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nfinds any support in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  They do not rely \non the Rule\u2019s history or structure.  They do not dispute \nthat the decision below thwarts the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nAnd they do not explain how it is \u201cjust\u201d to relieve \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices\u2014which \nwould burden both defendants and the courts with \nduplicative litigation.  Id.; see Pet.Br.37; Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 369 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). \nNor do Respondents grapple with the many ways \nin which the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test clashes \nwith other provisions of Rule 60(b).  See Pet.Br.31-34.  \nThey do not dispute that it enables plaintiffs to evade \nRule 60\u2019s strict time limitations where allegations are \nomitted by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), \n(c)(1).  Nor do they explain why plaintiffs could wield \nRule 60(b)(6) to introduce previously available facts \nyears after judgment, when Rule 60 elsewhere limits \nrelief to matters \u201cnewly discovered\u201d within a year of \njudgment that \u201ccould not have been discovered\u201d before \nwith \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test invites that internal \ninconsistency.  See Mandala, 88 F.4th at 365 (ordering \nvacatur and amendment \u201cbased on information that \nwas publicly available for years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint\u201d). \nAs to mistake, Respondents claim that \u201cthe Second \nCircuit has never suggested that vacatur and \n\n11 \n \namendment are permissible where a complaint failed \ndue to counsel\u2019s mistake.\u201d  Resp.Br.43.  But, even \nsetting aside the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) is not limited \nto counsel\u2019s mistakes, see Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534-35, \nthe Second Circuit has required just that.  It deployed \nits balancing test in Mandala to compel the reopening \nof a final judgment, even though the \u201cvacatur motion \nar[ose] from a legal mistake based on insufficient \npleading.\u201d  88 F.4th at 360.  That is precisely \nRespondents\u2019 theory here too\u2014that they made a legal \nmistake as to which facts they needed to allege to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s statutory standard.  See Resp.Br.45.3 \nRetreating from Rule 60(b), Respondents note that \nRule 15 \u201ccontemplates two stages of amendment\u2014\nbefore trial and during or after trial.\u201d  Resp.Br.42.  Yet, \nthey fail to explain why that might bear on the \nthreshold vacatur inquiry, which necessarily occurs in \nthe post-judgment context.  At that point, \u201c[t]he suit is \nover.\u201d  Pe\u00f1a v. Mattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996).  \n\u201cThere is no complaint to amend.\u201d  Id.  And \nRespondents concede \u201cthat Rule 15(a) \u2018does not \nprovide a mechanism for amending pleadings after \ndismissal.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.42 (quoting Pet.Br.30).  Rather, \nRule 60(b) defines the \u201climited set of circumstances\u201d \nthat might allow the losing party to \u201crequest \nreopening of his case.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  \n \n3  To be clear, Respondents\u2019 proposed amendments still fail to \nmeet JASTA\u2019s pleading standards under this Court\u2019s decision in \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023), and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s own precedents.  That question is not presented here \nbecause the District Court correctly instructed the parties not to \naddress futility (a Rule 15 question) until Respondents first \ndemonstrated that they could justify vacatur under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014which they could not.  See Pet.App.11, 13; JA.509. \n\n12 \n \nWhile Respondents baldly insist that Rule 15(a) lurks \nin the background to \u201cpresumably inform[] the reasons \nthat \u2018justify relief\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d Resp.Br.42-\n43, that is simply wrong.  \u201cAs long as the judgment \nremains in effect, Rule 15(a) is inapposite.\u201d  Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 508-09 (1st Cir. 2009). \nIf anything, Respondents\u2019 invocation of Rule 15(b) \nrefutes their approach.  That Rule contemplates two \ntypes of late-breaking amendments, neither of which \napplies here.  First, if a party objects that its \nopponent\u2019s evidence at trial deviates from the \npleadings, then the \u201ccourt should freely permit an \namendment when doing so will aid in presenting the \nmerits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court \nthat the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action \nor defense on the merits.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(1).  \nSecond, \u201c[w]hen an issue not raised by the pleadings \nis tried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent, it \nmust be treated in all respects as if raised in the \npleadings.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2).  In that situation, \n\u201c[a] party may move\u2014at any time, even after \njudgment\u2014to amend the pleadings to conform them to \nthe evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue.\u201d  Id.4  \nRule 15 thus contemplates a single, narrow, consent-\nbased ground for a party to amend \u201cafter judgment.\u201d  \nId.  In turn, the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d of expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius confirms that Rule 15 does not apply \nto any other post-judgment efforts to amend.  Bittner \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 94 (2023).  Rather, post-\n \n4  A \u201cfailure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that \nissue.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2).  But amendment can be \u201cuseful in \nclarifying the record on appeal or in determining the preclusive \neffects to be given to the judgment.\u201d  3 James Wm. Moore et al., \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.18[1] (3d ed. 2024). \n\n13 \n \njudgment relief falls squarely within the bailiwick of \nRule 60(b). \nTaking a slightly different tack, Respondents insist \nthat \u201c[p]laintiffs should have the opportunity to have \ntheir case adjudicated on the merits.\u201d  Resp.Br.24.  But \nthey did, in fact, have their case decided on the merits:  \nA final \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d is an \u201cadjudication \non the merits.\u201d  Lomax v. Ortiz-Marquez, 590 U.S. 595, \n601 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).  Respondents \nmerely lost that merits battle.  Along the way, they \ndeliberately chose to stand on their complaint.  They \ndeclined to appeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d aspect of the \ndismissal.  Then they lost again on appeal.  As a result, \nthey cannot reopen the judgment to pursue an \namended complaint unless they satisfy the strictures \nof Rule 60(b). \nIn short, where a losing party seeks leave to file an \namended complaint following a final judgment, it \nmust first clear Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately high hurdle \nfor setting aside that judgment.  The Second Circuit \nerred in collapsing these two inquiries into a single, \nnebulous balancing test. \nB. Respondents Concede that Rule 60(b)(6) \nProvides No Basis for Relief from a Party\u2019s \nVoluntary Litigation Choices. \nRespondents likewise cannot square the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach with basic principles of waiver.  \nIndeed, they do not contest that it would be an abuse \nof discretion for a court to \u201cexcuse a party\u2019s voluntary \nwaiver of a court\u2019s invitation to amend.\u201d  Pet.Br.28; see \nWood, 566 U.S. at 472-73.   \n\n14 \n \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of justice \u201cis designed around the premise that \nparties represented by competent counsel know what \nis best for them, and are responsible for advancing the \nfacts and argument entitling them to relief.\u201d  United \nStates v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375-76 (2020) \n(citation and brackets omitted).  Thus, where a \nplaintiff makes a \u201cvoluntary\u201d choice to rest on their \npleadings\u2014thereby waiving the opportunity to amend \ntheir complaint\u2014Rule 60(b)(6) provides no recourse.  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 200. \nThat principle applies with equal force to \nforfeitures in the context of Rule 60(b)(6).  Rule 60(b) \nmakes clear that if a party is even \u201cpartly to blame for \nthe delay, relief must be sought within one year under \nsubsection (1) and the party\u2019s neglect must be \nexcusable.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That \nparty cannot \u201cseek relief more than a year after the \njudgment by resorting to subsection (6).\u201d  Id.; see \nPet.Br.27-28.   \nRespondents do not contest this either.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s balancing test contravenes that \nframework.  It enables plaintiffs to obtain relief \nthrough Rule 60(b)(6) even when they \u201cwere \nrepeatedly apprised\u201d prior to judgment of the \u201cprecise \npleading defect\u201d that led to dismissal.  Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 368 (Sullivan, J., dissenting); see also \nPet.App.19 (similar).  Granting such a mulligan to \nplaintiffs who caused their own predicament defies the \ntext and structure of Rule 60(b). \nNone of this is to suggest that Rule 60(b) can never \nprovide an avenue for plaintiffs seeking to set aside a \njudgment to pursue an amended complaint.  But the \n\n15 \n \nRule itself sets the parameters for doing so.  For \ninstance, if a plaintiff\u2019s belated allegations were \nomitted because of its \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cexcusable \nneglect,\u201d then Rule 60(b)(1) provides a year in which \nto seek relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  The same \ngoes for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that could not \nhave been found earlier with \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  And so too for a \u201cmistake\u201d \nmade by either the court or the parties or their \nattorneys\u2014whether that be an \u201cerror[] \u2018of law or fact.\u2019\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 534 (quoting Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 1195 (3d ed. 1933)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  A party can also seek relief under Rule 59(e)\u2019s \nmore forgiving standard within 28 days of judgment.  \nOr, in rare cases, truly extraordinary circumstances \noutside the party\u2019s control might justify relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).  Cf. Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. \n601, 613-15 (1949) (lead op.). \nBut what plaintiffs cannot do is what Respondents \ndid here\u2014waive multiple opportunities to amend, \nlitigate the matter to final judgment, drag their \nopponent through an unsuccessful appeal, and then \ntry to use Rule 60(b)(6) to start the process all over.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday, and free, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6). \nUnder the proper Rule 60(b)(6) standard, this is a \nstraightforward \ncase. \n \nPetitioner \nrepeatedly \nemphasized that the complaint failed to allege that the \nbank was aware of a link between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas \u201cat the time\u201d it provided the \ncustomers routine banking services.  Pet.App.109; \n\n16 \n \nJA.145; JA.175-77; JA.249-51.  On multiple occasions, \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nafforded \nRespondents \nthe \nopportunity to cure any deficiencies in their pleadings \nthrough amendment.  Pet.App.93-94; Pet.App.124-25.  \nAnd, each time, Respondents \u201cexpressly declined\u201d the \ninvitation.  Pet.App.17-18.   \nThe District Court then dismissed their complaint, \nexplaining that it failed to plausibly allege Petitioner \n\u201cwas aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time.\u201d  Pet.App.74-75.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cbecause the allegations \ndo not support an inference that [Petitioner] was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Only then did \nRespondents seek to reopen the judgment to file an \namended complaint\u2014in direct contradiction to their \nprior position that they \u201cwould not seek leave to \namend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nThis is thus a classic case of litigator\u2019s remorse, for \nwhich Rule 60(b)(6) provides no relief.  Through \nsophisticated counsel, Respondents repeatedly waived \nor forfeited opportunities to amend their complaint in \nboth the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  \nThese litigation choices led to dismissal with prejudice \nand affirmance on appeal.  And Respondents have not \n\u201cshow[n] \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justifying the \nreopening of a final judgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at \n535 (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.App.14-19.  The District Court certainly did not \nabuse its discretion in reaching that conclusion.   \nRespondents conspicuously fail to address this \ndeferential standard of review anywhere in their brief.  \n\n17 \n \nAnd their last-ditch effort (at 44-49) to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances falls flat.   \nTo start, Respondents insist that they \u201chave yet to \nbe afforded a single opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint.\u201d  Resp.Br.45 (citation omitted).  That is \ncategorically false.  They \u201ctwice expressly declined the \nopportunity to amend their complaint prior to the \n[District] Court\u2019s decision.\u201d  Pet.App.10.  And \nRespondents did not challenge the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \naspect of the dismissal during their first appeal.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  Those decisions were \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate,\u201d and Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d \nfrom the consequences of those voluntary choices \nthrough Rule 60(b)(6).  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198; \nsee Pet.App.19.   \nRespondents elsewhere concede there is nothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d about dismissing a complaint where \n\u201cthe plaintiff has had a meaningful chance to amend.\u201d  \nResp.Br.34.  And their claim that the multiple chances \nthey received were not \u201cmeaningful\u201d is flatly incorrect.  \nResp.Br.46.  Prior to dismissal, they were consistently \napprised of the timing mismatch between their \nallegations of general awareness and Petitioner\u2019s \nalleged provision of banking services.  See Pet.App.19.  \nPetitioner raised this argument in its pre-motion \nletter, see JA.144-45, in its memorandum of law \nsupporting the motion to dismiss, see JA.160-61, 174-\n85, and in its statements at oral argument, see \nPet.App.108-09.  Yet, Respondents chose not to amend. \nThis requirement of contemporaneous awareness \nwas also nothing new.  It traces directly to Halberstam \nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which both \nCongress and the Second Circuit had already \n\n18 \n \nrecognized as providing the \u201cproper legal framework\u201d \nfor JASTA liability.  Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d \n314, 329 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting JASTA, Pub. L. No. \n114-222, \u00a7 2(a)(5), 130 Stat. 852, 852 (2016)).  In fact, \nRespondents themselves urged the court to apply the \nHalberstam \nframework\u2014and \nacknowledged \nits \nrequirement that \u201cthe defendant must be generally \naware of his role . . . at the time he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  JA.210 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477).  Respondents have \nnever \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not allege facts \nsufficient to satisfy the standard for which they were \nadvocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  Nor have they argued \n\u201cthat any of their proposed new allegations were \nunavailable to them when given the opportunity to \namend.\u201d  Pet.App.15.  At best, their tactical decisions \nnot \nto \namend \nwere \nthe \nresult \nof \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1).  And they were time-barred from \nreopening on that basis.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  \nThey cannot end-run those limitations via Rule \n60(b)(6).  See Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533; Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393.5 \nRespondents next argue that the District Court\u2019s \n\u201cdismissal decision was premised on \u2018the wrong legal \n \n5  Respondents misconstrue (at 44) this interplay between \n60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6).  Petitioner has explained at length why \n\u201cRespondents cannot satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.\u201d  \nPet.Br.38-45 (capitalization altered).  And that is in part because \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion is, at best, \u201cbased on grounds \nspecified in clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  \nAccordingly, they cannot avail themselves of Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cany \nother reason\u201d language.  Id. (citation omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(6); Pet.Br.1, 16-17, 27-29, 31-33, 43-44.   \n\n19 \n \nstandard.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.47.  But that argument similarly \nruns straight into the teeth of Rule 60(b)(1), which \n\u201ccovers all mistakes of law made by a judge.\u201d  Kemp, \n596 U.S. at 534.  Rule 60(b)(6) is thus inapplicable.  \nSee id. at 533. \nMoreover, any supposed legal errors cannot excuse \nRespondents\u2019 waivers here because the District Court \ndid not articulate what standard it would apply until \nit issued its decision.  That decision came after \nRespondents proclaimed they \u201cwould not seek leave to \namend\u201d and after they confirmed \u201c[t]here are no facts \nthat [they] would have\u201d to address the deficiencies \nPetitioner identified\u2014including the lack of allegations \nsupporting awareness.  Pet.App.94, 125.  Respondents\u2019 \nallegations on this front were deficient in both the eyes \nof the District Court and the Second Circuit.  And the \n\u201c[District] \nCourt\u2019s \nruling \nthat \n[Respondents\u2019] \ncomplaint d[id] not plausibly allege that [Petitioner] \nwas generally aware of any connection between the \nThree Customers and Hamas [was] not meaningfully \ndifferent from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling as to this \nsame basis for affirming th[e] Court\u2019s dismissal.\u201d  \nPet.App.15 n.3 (quotation marks omitted); see \nPet.App.49-52. \nTo the extent the two decisions differed, any \n\u201cclarification\u201d by the Second Circuit did not compel the \nDistrict Court to reopen its affirmed final judgment.  \nCongress did not amend JASTA, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s decision in the first appeal did not overrule \nprior precedents.  It merely applied the statutory text \nand existing caselaw to the facts alleged.  Thus, there \nwas no change in law.  Respondents instead argue only \nthat the District Court \u201cmisapplied controlling law.\u201d  \n\n20 \n \nResp.Br.12 (emphasis added).  In Kemp, this Court \nheld that this precise type of attack on a final \njudgment falls within Rule 60(b)(1), not Rule 60(b)(6).  \nSee 596 U.S. at 535 n.2 (\u201cKemp alleged that the \nDistrict Court erred by misapplying controlling \nlaw[.]\u201d); see also Pet.Br.32-33, 40-41.6   \nFurther, to the extent Respondents claim they \n\u201ccould not anticipate\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \nResp.Br.48, that too is just another way of saying they \nwere \u201csurprise[d],\u201d made a pleading \u201cmistake,\u201d or \nfailed to include the allegations previously available to \nthem because of \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  All of those grounds for relief \nare explicitly covered by Rule 60(b)(1), and thus fall \noutside Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cother reason\u201d language. \nIn any event, this case pales in comparison to those \nfew extraordinary cases where this Court has found \nRule 60(b)(6) relief appropriate.  In Klapprott, for \nexample, the petitioner sought to set aside a default \njudgment renouncing his citizenship, because he had \nbeen \u201cweakened from illness,\u201d unable to obtain \ncounsel, \u201cwrongfully\u201d detained, and then imprisoned \nby \n\u201chis \nadversary \nin \nthe \ndenaturalization \nproceedings,\u201d with \u201cno reasonable opportunity\u201d to \ndefend himself.  335 U.S. at 607-08, 613-15.  In \n \n6  Respondents insist (at 48) that an outright change in law might \nsometimes justify post-judgment relief.  But this Court has made \nclear that a change in law is not per se \u201cextraordinary.\u201d  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-37.  Whether it ever can be a basis for \n60(b)(6) relief, as opposed to a \u201c\u2018mistake\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(1),\u201d is \nan open question.  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 535 n.2.  Regardless, \nbecause the law here did not change and Respondents argue only \nthat the District Court \u201cmisapplied controlling law,\u201d this Court \nneed not address the issue. \n\n21 \n \nLiljeberg, the judge who presided over a bench trial \n\u201cinexcusabl[y]\u201d failed to recuse himself, despite an \n\u201cobvious conflict of interest\u201d that the movant could not \nreasonably discover.  486 U.S. at 850, 863-66 & n.11.  \nAnd in Buck v. Davis, the petitioner \u201cidentified 11 \nfactors\u201d in his capital murder case\u2014including the \nintroduction of expert evidence suggesting \u201cthe color \nof [his] skin made him more deserving of execution,\u201d \nthe State\u2019s confession of error in similar cases, and \nchanged controlling law that removed a procedural \n\u201cbar[]\u201d to habeas review\u2014which could collectively \nwarrant relief.  580 U.S. 100, 113, 118-26 (2017). \nThis case is a far cry from those.  Respondents \u201chad \nample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but simply chose not to \npursue them.  Pet.App.16.  They are hardly \u201cfaultless \nin the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nThat precludes them from obtaining relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), and the District Court certainly did not abuse \nits discretion by denying Respondents\u2019 motion.   \nSwitching gears, Respondents assert that the \n\u201cburden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss\u201d is \u201cnot the \nkind of prejudice\u201d contemplated by Rule 15(a).  \nResp.Br.45.  Again, though, Respondents needed to \nsatisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \nvacating the final judgment \u201cbefore consideration \n[could] be given to [a Rule 15(a)] motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Those two Rules pose \nseparate inquiries.  See Pet.Br.20-38.  In any case, \nRespondents waived multiple opportunities to amend, \nand the \u201cfederal rule of waiver does not include a \nprejudice requirement.\u201d  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 419 (2022).  Even if it did, Petitioner \n\n22 \n \nwould clearly suffer prejudice if the Court were to \nnullify a final judgment\u2014secured after costly motions \npractice and then successfully defended in a \nprotracted appeal\u2014so that Respondents could pursue \na strategy they repeatedly rebuffed.  That is not how \nfederal litigation works. \nNor can Respondents dispute that they made a \n\u201cseries \nof \ndeliberate \nchoices\u201d \nnot \nto \namend.  \nPet.App.19.  They try to duck that inescapable \nconclusion as one \u201cnot accepted by the panel below.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court made that factual \nfinding, and the Second Circuit did not disturb it.  Nor \ncould it, because Respondents waived or forfeited at \nleast five opportunities to amend\u2014each of which \nsuffices to bar relief.  \nFirst, the District Court asked Respondents at the \npre-motion conference if they wanted the \u201copportunity \nto amend\u201d to plead \u201cadditional facts\u201d based on \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel replied \u201cNo,\u201d and he averred that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend\u201d if the pleadings fell short.  \nPet.App.94.  That is a textbook waiver. \nSecond, the District Court asked at oral argument \non the motion to dismiss whether \u201ceverything [it] \nneed[ed] to consider in terms of sufficiency of [the] \npleading [was] going to be found in the complaint.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  Respondents\u2019 counsel answered \u201cYes, \nYour Honor.\u201d  Pet.App.125.  Another textbook waiver. \nThird, Respondents opted not to file a Rule 59(e) \nmotion after the District Court\u2019s decision.  Doing so \nwould have enabled the court to consider a proposed \namended complaint and \u201cfix any mistakes\u201d that \n\n23 \n \nRespondents believed the court made, \u201cbefore a \npossible appeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. \nFourth, Respondents \u201cnever appealed the \u2018with \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal, and accordingly, \nwaived it.\u201d  Pet.App.16 n.4.  Yet they seek the same \nrelief that such an appeal could have provided, while \ntacitly conceding that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as \na substitute for appeal.\u201d  Pet.Br.44 (citation omitted). \nFifth, Respondents continued to sit on their hands \nbefore the Second Circuit, even though they admit \nthat \u201casking the circuit for leave to amend [was] \npermissible.\u201d  Resp.Br.40.  They forfeited that \nopportunity in their opening brief; they forfeited it in \ntheir reply brief; they forfeited it at oral argument; \nand they forfeited it in their supplemental brief. \n*   *   * \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test \ncollapses under the weight of text, context, structure, \nand precedent.  The proper inquiry for this Rule \n60(b)(6) motion is the one that has always applied to \nRule 60(b)(6) motions:  Respondents had to \u201cshow \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d not covered by any \nother provision of the Rule, that were beyond their \ncontrol and that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a \nfinal judgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (citation \nomitted).  They failed to meet that high bar. \n \n \n\n24 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case, built upon the detailed analysis of the parties' briefs, remains largely intact, but the latest observation\u2014the complete absence of amicus briefs\u2014adds a crucial contextual layer that refines my prediction. This is a significant \"negative signal,\" indicating what is *not* present in this case, which in turn informs the likely dynamics of the Court's decision-making.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Central Procedural Conflict (Now Contextualized as a \"Lawyer's Law\" Issue):** My core understanding of the Petitioner's strict, sequential application of Rules 60(b) and 15(a) versus the Respondents' holistic, equitable approach is stable. The absence of amicus briefs reinforces the view that this is a technical, \"inside baseball\" procedural dispute. It is not a case that has captured the attention of industry groups, civil liberties organizations, or other stakeholders who might have a policy interest in the outcome. This suggests the Court will likely treat it as a pure question of rule interpretation and judicial administration, rather than a case with broad societal consequences.\n\n2.  **Stable Understanding of Competing Narratives:** The \"deliberate choice\" vs. \"no meaningful opportunity\" narratives, drawn from the parties' briefs, remain the central equitable battleground. The lack of amicus support means the Court will only hear these two competing stories, with no external validation or alternative framing. The persuasiveness of each party's counsel in presenting their narrative will be paramount.\n\n3.  **Stable Belief in the Precedential Fault Line (*Foman* vs. *Gonzalez*):** The clash between the Respondents' reliance on the liberal amendment spirit of *Foman v. Davis* and the Petitioner's insistence on the strict \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard from *Gonzalez v. Crosby* for post-judgment relief remains the key legal question. The case will be won or lost on which precedential framework the Court deems applicable to a Rule 60(b) motion filed long after judgment.\n\n4.  **Refined Belief on the Circuit Split's Importance:** My previous belief was that the Petitioner's framing of an 11-1 circuit split was an overwhelmingly powerful argument for reversal. The new observation moderates this belief.\n    *   **New Belief: The Lack of an SG Brief Diminishes the Perceived Urgency.** The absence of an amicus brief from the U.S. Solicitor General is particularly telling. The government frequently weighs in on matters of federal procedure to advocate for uniformity and administrability. Their silence here suggests that, from the perspective of the executive branch (the largest federal litigator), the disuniformity caused by the Second Circuit's \"outlier\" standard is not creating a significant or unmanageable problem for federal courts.\n    *   While the Court's desire to resolve a deep circuit split remains a primary reason for taking the case, the lack of external pressure from major stakeholders like the U.S. government may lower the perceived stakes. It slightly weakens the Petitioner's argument that the Second Circuit's rule is creating a national crisis of procedure, reframing it as a more localized disagreement. This could give the Court more latitude to affirm the Second Circuit's nuanced approach if it finds it jurisprudentially sound, rather than feeling compelled to impose the majority rule simply for uniformity's sake.\n\nIn summary, the observation that no amicus briefs were filed is a significant non-event. It confirms the narrow, technical nature of the legal question and, most importantly, signals that major institutional players like the U.S. government do not perceive the circuit split as a pressing national problem. This tempers the weight I assign to the \"11-1 split\" argument. The case will be decided in an argumentative vacuum, based solely on the textual and precedential arguments in the parties' briefs. The key uncertainty remains the same\u2014how the Court will reconcile the competing rules and narratives\u2014but the external pressure to simply \"correct\" the outlier circuit for the sake of uniformity appears lower than previously believed. This might slightly increase the chances for the Respondents, as it allows more room for a merits-based evaluation of the Second Circuit's rule, but the Petitioner's straightforward, textualist argument for a clean, uniform standard remains very strong.",

The petitioner's arguments are exceptionally strong and multi-faceted, providing the Court with several clear paths to reversal. \n\nKey factors pointing to a reversal (and a 'Yes' answer to the question presented) are:\n1.  **Textual/Structural Argument:** The petitioner's merits reply brief forcefully argues that Rule 60(b)(6) is 'mutually exclusive' from Rule 60(b)(1). The respondents' justification for amendment (mistake/excusable neglect) falls under Rule 60(b)(1) and is time-barred. This argument, supported by the Court's recent decision in *Kemp v. United States*, is a clean, technical basis for reversal that avoids broader analysis and is highly appealing to a textualist court.\n2.  **Precedent Neutralization:** The petitioner has effectively distinguished *Foman v. Davis* (the respondent's key case) as a Rule 59(e) case, which is procedurally distinct from a Rule 60(b) motion. The petitioner powerfully cites the Court's own recent precedent in *Banister v. Davis* to emphasize this very distinction, making it easy for the Court to wall off *Foman* as inapplicable.\n3.  **Outlier Circuit:** The petitioner has successfully framed the Second Circuit's 'balancing test' as a judicial invention with no basis in the rules' text and as an outlier among the circuits. The citation to the recent Fourth Circuit case (*Daulatzai*) rejecting the Second Circuit's approach underscores that this is an active and deep circuit split, increasing the impetus for the Court to impose uniformity.\n4.  **Narrative of Waiver:** The petitioner has built a strong factual narrative that the respondents made a 'series of deliberate choices' not to amend their complaint at multiple earlier stages. This frames the respondents as seeking an unwarranted 'mulligan,' making the application of Rule 60(b)'s stringent 'extraordinary circumstances' standard seem not only legally correct but also equitable.\n\nThe legal question is whether Rule 60(b)(6)'s stringent standard *applies*. The petitioner's entire case is that it *does* apply and that the Second Circuit erred by diluting it with a Rule 15(a) balancing test. A vote for the petitioner is a 'Yes' to the legal question.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to evolve with each filing. The Petitioner's reply briefs, particularly the merits-stage reply, provide the final and most refined version of their arguments, directly responding to the Respondents and significantly sharpening the legal and narrative conflicts. This observation builds upon, and in some areas revises, my previous beliefs which were shaped by the initial briefs and the notable absence of amicus support.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Core Procedural Conflict (Now More Sharply Defined):** My core belief that this case hinges on the conflict between a strict, sequential application of Rules 60(b) and 15(a) versus a holistic \"balancing\" test remains stable. However, the Petitioner's reply brief moves beyond simply advocating for its preferred sequence.\n    *   **New Belief/Refinement:** The Petitioner now forcefully argues that the Second Circuit's \"balancing test\" is not just an alternative interpretation but is a judicial invention with no basis in the text, structure, or history of the Federal Rules. The brief frames the Second Circuit's approach as an illegitimate outlier that \"puts Rule 60(b) at war with itself.\" This escalates the argument from a mere disagreement over interpretation to a fundamental challenge to the lower court's authority to create such a test. This framing is potent, as it appeals to principles of textualism and judicial restraint.\n\n2.  **Refined Understanding of the Precedential Battleground (*Foman* vs. *Gonzalez*):** My prior belief centered on the clash between the liberal spirit of *Foman* and the strictness of *Gonzalez*. The reply brief provides a much more sophisticated and likely effective way to resolve this tension.\n    *   **New Belief/Refinement:** The Petitioner has drawn a clear and decisive line between the two precedents by highlighting their procedural postures. The brief emphasizes that *Foman* was a Rule 59(e) case, which addresses errors in a \"just-issued decision,\" while this case involves a Rule 60(b) motion, which \"attacks an already completed judgment.\" Crucially, the Petitioner cites the Supreme Court's own recent precedent in *Banister v. Davis* (2020) to underscore that the Court itself has stressed this material distinction. This provides the Justices with a direct, precedented path to wall off *Foman* as simply inapplicable to the Rule 60(b) context, thereby neutralizing the Respondents' primary authority.\n\n3.  **New, Powerful Structural Argument Emerges:** Beyond the clash of precedents, the Petitioner's reply brief introduces a potentially case-dispositive structural argument that I had not previously weighted heavily.\n    *   **New Belief:** The Petitioner argues that Rule 60(b)(6) (the \"any other reason\" catch-all) is \"mutually exclusive\" with the specific reasons listed in Rules 60(b)(1)-(5). They contend that the Respondents' justification for amendment\u2014a mistake or excusable neglect in not pleading certain facts\u2014falls squarely within Rule 60(b)(1). Because the motion was filed more than a year after judgment, it is time-barred under Rule 60(b)(1)'s strict deadline, and Rule 60(b)(6) cannot be used as an end-run around that limit. This argument, citing precedents like *Kemp v. United States*, offers the Court a clean, technical basis for reversal that avoids a broader ruling on the \"spirit\" of the rules and instead rests on their plain text and structure.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluation of the Circuit Split's Importance:** I previously moderated the importance of the 11-1 circuit split due to the lack of a Solicitor General amicus brief, which suggested the split wasn't causing a national administrative crisis. The Petitioner's reply brief effectively counters this.\n    *   **Refined Belief:** The Petitioner's citation to the very recent Fourth Circuit case, *Daulatzai v. Maryland* (2024), which explicitly rejected the Second Circuit's approach, reinvigorates the circuit split argument. It demonstrates that the disagreement is not merely historical but active and ongoing, with other circuits consciously choosing the opposite path. This signal of active judicial conflict increases the pressure on the Court to intervene for the sake of uniformity, partially offsetting the negative signal from the SG's silence.\n\n5.  **Strengthened Narrative of \"Deliberate Waiver\":** The competing narratives of \"deliberate choice\" vs. \"no meaningful opportunity\" remain central. The reply brief significantly strengthens the Petitioner's narrative.\n    *   **Refined Belief:** The Petitioner meticulously recounts the procedural history, emphasizing that the Respondents \"twice declined the opportunity to amend,\" chose to appeal the dismissal with prejudice without challenging that aspect, and failed to request leave to amend even during supplemental briefing. By framing these as a \"series of deliberate choices,\" and citing *Ackermann v. United States* for the principle that Rule 60(b) does not relieve parties from such calculated decisions, the Petitioner paints a compelling picture of a litigant seeking an unwarranted \"mulligan.\" This factual narrative makes the application of Rule 60(b)'s high bar seem not only legally correct but also equitable.\n\nIn summary, the Petitioner's reply briefs have substantially strengthened their position. The arguments are now more refined, textually grounded, and strategically aligned with the current Court's jurisprudential tendencies. The introduction of the powerful \"mutual exclusivity\" argument and the effective neutralization of *Foman* provide clear, compelling paths to reversal. While my previous belief saw a slight opening for the Respondents, my updated belief is that the legal and narrative momentum has swung decisively in the Petitioner's favor. The key uncertainty is less about the outcome and more about which of the Petitioner's strong arguments the Court will adopt as the basis for its reversal.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case, which evolved significantly with the filing of the petitioner's reply briefs, has now reached a state of high confidence and stability. The latest observation, representing an internal synthesis of all reviewed materials, confirms and solidifies the beliefs formed from the petitioner's powerful final arguments. My belief system has transitioned from analyzing competing claims to a cohesive predictive model anticipating the Court's likely reasoning.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in the Core Procedural Conflict (Now a Solidified Predictive Pillar):** My core belief that this case hinges on the conflict between a strict, sequential application of Rules 60(b) and 15(a) versus a holistic \"balancing\" test is now a foundational element of my prediction.\n    *   **Refinement/Solidification:** I now firmly believe the Court will reject the Second Circuit's \"balancing test\" as an extra-textual judicial invention. The petitioner's framing of the test as putting \"Rule 60(b) at war with itself\" is highly resonant with the current Court's preference for textualism and judicial restraint. The Second Circuit's approach will likely be characterized as an illegitimate outlier, not a plausible alternative interpretation.\n\n2.  **Stable Belief in the Precedential Battleground (Now Resolved):** The tension between *Foman v. Davis* and *Gonzalez v. Crosby* is, in my assessment, resolved.\n    *   **Refinement/Solidification:** The petitioner's clear distinction between *Foman* (a Rule 59(e) case) and the present Rule 60(b) context has become a central belief. The citation to *Banister v. Davis* (2020), where the Supreme Court itself emphasized this procedural distinction, provides the Justices with their own precedent to cleanly wall off *Foman* as inapplicable. I now believe the Court will not struggle with this conflict but will instead adopt this distinction as a straightforward way to neutralize the respondents' primary authority.\n\n3.  **Stable Belief in the Structural Argument (Now the Most Likely Path to Reversal):** The petitioner's structural argument regarding the mutual exclusivity of Rule 60(b)'s subsections has elevated from a compelling point to what I now see as the most probable basis for the Court's decision.\n    *   **Refinement/Solidification:** I am now highly confident the Court will agree that the respondents' justification for amending their complaint (a mistake or excusable neglect) falls squarely within the time-barred Rule 60(b)(1), and that Rule 60(b)(6) cannot be used as a catch-all to circumvent that one-year deadline. This argument, buttressed by precedent like *Kemp v. United States*, offers a clean, technical, and text-grounded path for reversal that is highly appealing. It allows the Court to resolve the case on narrow procedural grounds without making a broader ruling on the \"spirit\" of the rules.\n\n4.  **Stable Belief in the Narrative of \"Deliberate Waiver\" (Now a Supporting Equitable Justification):** The competing narratives remain central, but my belief is now firm that the petitioner's version will prevail.\n    *   **Refinement/Solidification:** The petitioner's meticulous recitation of the procedural history, highlighting the respondents' \"series of deliberate choices\" to forgo amendment, has successfully framed the respondents as litigants seeking an unwarranted second chance. Citing *Ackermann v. United States*, the Court is likely to find that Rule 60(b) does not exist to relieve parties from their own calculated litigation strategies. This narrative makes the application of Rule 60(b)'s stringent standard feel not only legally correct but also equitable.\n\nIn summary, my beliefs have crystallized. The analysis of the briefs has yielded a clear predictive framework with multiple, reinforcing paths to the same outcome. The petitioner has provided the Court with a textual argument (mutual exclusivity of Rule 60(b) subsections), a precedential argument (distinguishing *Foman* via *Banister*), and a narrative argument (deliberate waiver). I now believe a reversal for the petitioner is the most probable outcome, which directly corresponds to a \"Yes\" answer to the legal question: Rule 60(b)(6)'s stringent standard does indeed apply. The remaining uncertainty is not about the outcome, but which of these strong arguments will form the core of the majority opinion.",
