    "facts_of_the_case": "This case involves an agreement between two Indian corporations, Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. and Antrix Corp. Ltd. After a dispute arose, Devas obtained an arbitration award from the International Chamber of Commerce against Antrix. Devas then sought to confirm this award in a U.S. district court. Antrix challenged the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction, but the district court confirmed the award, concluding that a minimum contacts analysis was unnecessary under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).\n\nAntrix appealed the confirmation order, arguing that the district court erred in exercising personal jurisdiction without conducting a minimum contacts analysis. Meanwhile, a group of intervenors, including CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd. and others, moved to register the judgment in the Eastern District of Virginia. Both Antrix and Devas challenged this registration order. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the plaintiff must prove minimum contacts, and its failure to do so meant it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over Antrix.",

Articulating and adopting this plan refines the agent's general strategic model (D) for how to approach these tasks.\n- **Joint EIG is high (1.5)** as the action provides significant value by both structuring the immediate task for success and reinforcing a robust, reusable analytical framework.",

The \nNinth Circuit\u2019s denial of rehearing (Pet.App. 42a-68a) \nis reported at 91 F.4th 1340.  The opinion of the dis-\ntrict court confirming the arbitral award (Pet.App. \n17a-35a) is unreported but is available at 2020 WL \n6286813.  The opinion of the district court granting \nleave to register the judgment in the Eastern District \nof Virginia (Pet.App. 36a-41a) is unreported but is \navailable at 2022 WL 36731. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on August \n1, 2023.  Timely petitions for rehearing were denied \non February 6, 2024 (Pet.App. 45a).  The timely peti-\ntions for certiorari were granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution provides that: \nNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, lib-\nerty, or property, without due process of law \n* * * . \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) provides that: \nPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall \nexist as to every claim for relief over which the \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction under subsec-\n\n2 \n \ntion (a) where service has been made under \nsection 1608 of this title. \nSTATEMENT \nIn the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA or \nAct), Congress and the President created a compre-\nhensive scheme governing when United States courts \nmay exercise jurisdiction over foreign states.  The \nFSIA provides that \u201ca foreign state shall be immune\u201d \nunless one of several enumerated exceptions to im-\nmunity applies.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091604.  The FSIA includes \na system governing service of process on a foreign \nstate.  Id. \u00a7\u20091608.  And the FSIA provides that \u201cper-\nsonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to \nevery claim for relief \u201d  where an enumerated excep-\ntion to immunity applies and \u201cwhere service has been \nmade\u201d under Section 1608.  Id. \u00a7\u20091330(b). \nHere, it is undisputed that one of the FSIA\u2019s enu-\nmerated exceptions to immunity, the arbitral excep-\ntion, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(6), applies.  Pet.App. 54a.  \nAnd it is likewise undisputed that service was \nproperly made under Section 1608.  Yet the Ninth Cir-\ncuit vacated the judgment confirming an arbitration \naward, holding that FSIA plaintiffs must satisfy an \nadditional requirement\u2014found nowhere in the text of \nthe FSIA or the Constitution\u2014and prove that a for-\neign state has the requisite minimum contacts with \nthe United States to satisfy the standard of Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), \nand its progeny.  That holding is wrong and should be \nreversed. \nThe FSIA\u2019s text is clear.  Personal jurisdiction \n\u201cshall exist\u201d if a state is served and is not immune un-\nder the Act.  The Ninth Circuit based its contrary \n\n3 \n \nholding not on the text, but on decades-old precedent \nthat rests on a misinterpretation of the FSIA\u2019s legis-\nlative history.  That legislative history cannot super-\nsede the text of the Act and, in any event, does not \nsupport the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding. \nNor does the Constitution provide a basis for re-\nquiring minimum contacts, as Antrix has argued and \nanother Ninth Circuit precedent erroneously holds.  \nThe Fifth Amendment provides that no \u201cperson\u201d may \nbe \u201cdeprived of * * * property, without due process of \nlaw.\u201d  U.S. Const. amdt. V.  In Republic of Argentina \nv. Weltover, Inc., this Court suggested that foreign \nstates, like States of the Union, are not \u201cpersons\u201d pro-\ntected by the Due Process Clause.  504 U.S. 607, 619 \n(1992).  That suggestion conforms both with the inter-\npretive principle that \u201cperson\u201d does not include a sov-\nereign and the Court\u2019s precedent holding that States \nof the Union are not persons entitled to invoke due \nprocess protections.     \nBut even if foreign states were \u201cpersons\u201d protected \nby the Due Process Clause, there still would be no ba-\nsis for imposing a minimum-contacts limitation on the \nFSIA\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction over foreign \nstates.  Congress and the President, acting in a do-\nmain in which they have exclusive competence, have \nprovided in the FSIA a comprehensive system of sub-\nstantive and procedural protections for foreign states.  \nThe FSIA\u2019s protections far exceed whatever process is \ndue in this area under the Fifth Amendment. \n1.  For most of this Nation\u2019s history, \u201cthe United \nStates generally granted foreign sovereigns complete \nimmunity from suit in the courts of this country.\u201d  Ver-\nlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, \n\n4 \n \n486 (1983).  At the time of the founding, it was gener-\nally understood that \u201cthe jurisdiction of a nation \nwithin its own territory \u2018is susceptible of no limitation \nnot imposed by itself,\u2019\u200a\u201d and this Nation accorded im-\nmunity to foreign states as \u201ca matter of grace and com-\nity on the part of the United States, and not a re-\nstriction imposed by the Constitution.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nThe Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. (7 \nCranch) 116, 136 (1812)).  Because the immunity of \nforeign states from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts \n\u201cstands upon principles of public comity and conven-\nience\u201d \u201cit may be withdrawn upon notice at any time, \nwithout just offence.\u201d  The Santissima Trinidad, 20 \nU.S. (7 Wheat.) 283, 353 (1822). \nBecause the immunity of foreign states from the \njurisdiction of federal courts was understood as a mat-\nter of comity and custom rather than constitutional \nright, courts correctly \u201cdeferred to the decisions of the \npolitical branches\u2014in particular, those of the Execu-\ntive Branch\u2014on whether to take jurisdiction over ac-\ntions against foreign sovereigns and their instrumen-\ntalities.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 486.  The longstand-\ning practice of federal courts was to abstain from ex-\nercising jurisdiction over foreign states and their \nproperty in all cases in which the State Department \nrecognized a claim of immunity.  A foreign state \nthreatened with suit in American courts could \u201cpre-\nsent its claim to the Department of State, the political \narm of the Government charged with the conduct of \nour foreign affairs.\u201d  Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 \nU.S. 578, 588 (1943).  \u201cUpon recognition and allow-\nance of the claim by the State Department and certi-\nfication of its action presented to the court by the At-\ntorney General, it [was] the court\u2019s duty\u201d to refrain \n\n5 \n \nfrom exercising its jurisdiction and refer the plaintiff \nto \u201crelief obtainable through diplomatic negotiations.\u201d  \nIbid. \nJust as it was \u201cnot for the courts to deny an im-\nmunity which our government ha[d] seen fit to allow,\u201d \ncourts also had no warrant \u201cto allow an immunity on \nnew grounds which the government ha[d] not seen fit \nto recognize.\u201d  Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U.S. \n30, 35 (1945).  That is because \u201crecognition by the \ncourts of an immunity upon principles which the po-\nlitical department of government has not sanctioned \nmay be equally embarrassing\u201d as the judicial denial of \na recognized immunity \u201cin securing the protection of \nour national interests and their recognition by other \nnations.\u201d  Id. at 36. \n2.  This regime was in place for most of our na-\ntion\u2019s history.  \u201cUntil 1952, the State Department or-\ndinarily requested immunity in all actions against \nfriendly foreign sovereigns.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at \n486.  That year, the State Department in the \u201cTate \nLetter\u201d announced that it \u201cwould thereafter apply the \n\u2018restrictive theory\u2019 of sovereign immunity,\u201d under \nwhich \u201cthe immunity of the sovereign is recognized \nwith regard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) \nof a state, but not with respect to private acts (jure \ngestionis).\u201d  Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. \n677, 689-90 (2004).   \n\u201c[T]he change in State Department policy \nwrought by the \u2018Tate Letter\u2019 had little, if any impact \non federal courts\u2019 approach to immunity analyses\u201d be-\ncause \u201c \u2018[a]s in the past, initial responsibility for decid-\ning questions of sovereign immunity fell primarily \nupon the Executive acting through the State Depart-\n\n6 \n \nment,\u2019 and courts continued to \u2018abid[e] by\u2019 that De-\npartment\u2019s \u2018suggestions of immunity.\u2019 \u201d  Id. at 690 \n(quoting Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 487).   \nThe State Department\u2019s adoption of the restrictive \ntheory of sovereign immunity nevertheless \u201c \u2018thr[ew] \nimmunity determinations into some disarray,\u2019 since \n\u2018political considerations sometimes led the Depart-\nment to file suggestions of immunity in cases where \nimmunity would not have been available under the re-\nstrictive theory.\u2019 \u201d  Republic of Argentina v. NML Cap-\nital, Ltd., 573 U.S. 134, 141 (2014) (quoting Altmann, \n541 U.S. at 690).  And \u201cwhen in particular cases the \nState Department did not suggest immunity, courts \nmade immunity determinations \u2018generally by refer-\nence to prior State Department decisions.\u2019 \u201d  Ibid.   \nThus, between 1952 and 1976, \u201csovereign immun-\nity determinations were made in two different \nbranches, subject to a variety of factors, sometimes in-\ncluding diplomatic considerations\u201d and \u201cthe governing \nstandards were neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d  \nVerlinden, 461 U.S. at 488.   \n3.  In 1976, Congress and the President \u201cabated \nthe bedlam\u201d of the Tate Letter system by enacting the \nFSIA.  NML Capital, 573 U.S. at 141.  \u201cBy reason of \nits authority over foreign commerce and foreign rela-\ntions, Congress has the undisputed power to decide, \nas a matter of federal law, whether and under what \ncircumstances foreign nations should be amenable to \nsuit in the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 493.  \nCongress accordingly \u201cexercised its Article I powers by \nenacting a statute \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n20: 20241204151854682_Devas20Merits20Brief20Certificate20of20Service.json (score: 0.449)\nNos. 23-1201, 24-17\n\nINTHE\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\n(CC/Devas (MAURITIUS) LaarrED;\nDEVAS MULTIMEDIA AMERICA, INC.;\nDEVAS EMPLOYEES MAURITIUS PRIVATE LIMITED;\n\u2018TsLcom Devas MAURITIUS LIMITED,\nPetitioners,\nvw\n\nAnrarx Corp.

The \nNinth Circuit\u2019s denial of rehearing (Pet.App. 42a-68a) \nis reported at 91 F.4th 1340.  The opinion of the dis-\ntrict court confirming the arbitral award (Pet.App. \n17a-35a) is unreported but is available at 2020 WL \n6286813.  The opinion of the district court granting \nleave to register the judgment in the Eastern District \nof Virginia (Pet.App. 36a-41a) is unreported but is \navailable at 2022 WL 36731. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on August \n1, 2023.  Timely petitions for rehearing were denied \non February 6, 2024 (Pet.App. 45a).  The timely peti-\ntions for certiorari were granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution provides that: \nNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, lib-\nerty, or property, without due process of law \n* * * . \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) provides that: \nPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall \nexist as to every claim for relief over which the \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction under subsec-\n\n2 \n \ntion (a) where service has been made under \nsection 1608 of this title. \nSTATEMENT \nIn the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA or \nAct), Congress and the President created a compre-\nhensive scheme governing when United States courts \nmay exercise jurisdiction over foreign states.  The \nFSIA provides that \u201ca foreign state shall be immune\u201d \nunless one of several enumerated exceptions to im-\nmunity applies.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091604.  The FSIA includes \na system governing service of process on a foreign \nstate.  Id. \u00a7\u20091608.  And the FSIA provides that \u201cper-\nsonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to \nevery claim for relief \u201d  where an enumerated excep-\ntion to immunity applies and \u201cwhere service has been \nmade\u201d under Section 1608.  Id. \u00a7\u20091330(b). \nHere, it is undisputed that one of the FSIA\u2019s enu-\nmerated exceptions to immunity, the arbitral excep-\ntion, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(6), applies.  Pet.App. 54a.  \nAnd it is likewise undisputed that service was \nproperly made under Section 1608.  Yet the Ninth Cir-\ncuit vacated the judgment confirming an arbitration \naward, holding that FSIA plaintiffs must satisfy an \nadditional requirement\u2014found nowhere in the text of \nthe FSIA or the Constitution\u2014and prove that a for-\neign state has the requisite minimum contacts with \nthe United States to satisfy the standard of Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), \nand its progeny.  That holding is wrong and should be \nreversed. \nThe FSIA\u2019s text is clear.  Personal jurisdiction \n\u201cshall exist\u201d if a state is served and is not immune un-\nder the Act.  The Ninth Circuit based its contrary \n\n3 \n \nholding not on the text, but on decades-old precedent \nthat rests on a misinterpretation of the FSIA\u2019s legis-\nlative history.  That legislative history cannot super-\nsede the text of the Act and, in any event, does not \nsupport the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding. \nNor does the Constitution provide a basis for re-\nquiring minimum contacts, as Antrix has argued and \nanother Ninth Circuit precedent erroneously holds.  \nThe Fifth Amendment provides that no \u201cperson\u201d may \nbe \u201cdeprived of * * * property, without due process of \nlaw.\u201d  U.S. Const. amdt. V.  In Republic of Argentina \nv. Weltover, Inc., this Court suggested that foreign \nstates, like States of the Union, are not \u201cpersons\u201d pro-\ntected by the Due Process Clause.  504 U.S. 607, 619 \n(1992).  That suggestion conforms both with the inter-\npretive principle that \u201cperson\u201d does not include a sov-\nereign and the Court\u2019s precedent holding that States \nof the Union are not persons entitled to invoke due \nprocess protections.     \nBut even if foreign states were \u201cpersons\u201d protected \nby the Due Process Clause, there still would be no ba-\nsis for imposing a minimum-contacts limitation on the \nFSIA\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction over foreign \nstates.  Congress and the President, acting in a do-\nmain in which they have exclusive competence, have \nprovided in the FSIA a comprehensive system of sub-\nstantive and procedural protections for foreign states.  \nThe FSIA\u2019s protections far exceed whatever process is \ndue in this area under the Fifth Amendment. \n1.  For most of this Nation\u2019s history, \u201cthe United \nStates generally granted foreign sovereigns complete \nimmunity from suit in the courts of this country.\u201d  Ver-\nlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, \n\n4 \n \n486 (1983).  At the time of the founding, it was gener-\nally understood that \u201cthe jurisdiction of a nation \nwithin its own territory \u2018is susceptible of no limitation \nnot imposed by itself,\u2019\u200a\u201d and this Nation accorded im-\nmunity to foreign states as \u201ca matter of grace and com-\nity on the part of the United States, and not a re-\nstriction imposed by the Constitution.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nThe Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. (7 \nCranch) 116, 136 (1812)).  Because the immunity of \nforeign states from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts \n\u201cstands upon principles of public comity and conven-\nience\u201d \u201cit may be withdrawn upon notice at any time, \nwithout just offence.\u201d  The Santissima Trinidad, 20 \nU.S. (7 Wheat.) 283, 353 (1822). \nBecause the immunity of foreign states from the \njurisdiction of federal courts was understood as a mat-\nter of comity and custom rather than constitutional \nright, courts correctly \u201cdeferred to the decisions of the \npolitical branches\u2014in particular, those of the Execu-\ntive Branch\u2014on whether to take jurisdiction over ac-\ntions against foreign sovereigns and their instrumen-\ntalities.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 486.  The longstand-\ning practice of federal courts was to abstain from ex-\nercising jurisdiction over foreign states and their \nproperty in all cases in which the State Department \nrecognized a claim of immunity.  A foreign state \nthreatened with suit in American courts could \u201cpre-\nsent its claim to the Department of State, the political \narm of the Government charged with the conduct of \nour foreign affairs.\u201d  Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 \nU.S. 578, 588 (1943).  \u201cUpon recognition and allow-\nance of the claim by the State Department and certi-\nfication of its action presented to the court by the At-\ntorney General, it [was] the court\u2019s duty\u201d to refrain \n\n5 \n \nfrom exercising its jurisdiction and refer the plaintiff \nto \u201crelief obtainable through diplomatic negotiations.\u201d  \nIbid. \nJust as it was \u201cnot for the courts to deny an im-\nmunity which our government ha[d] seen fit to allow,\u201d \ncourts also had no warrant \u201cto allow an immunity on \nnew grounds which the government ha[d] not seen fit \nto recognize.\u201d  Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U.S. \n30, 35 (1945).  That is because \u201crecognition by the \ncourts of an immunity upon principles which the po-\nlitical department of government has not sanctioned \nmay be equally embarrassing\u201d as the judicial denial of \na recognized immunity \u201cin securing the protection of \nour national interests and their recognition by other \nnations.\u201d  Id. at 36. \n2.  This regime was in place for most of our na-\ntion\u2019s history.  \u201cUntil 1952, the State Department or-\ndinarily requested immunity in all actions against \nfriendly foreign sovereigns.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at \n486.  That year, the State Department in the \u201cTate \nLetter\u201d announced that it \u201cwould thereafter apply the \n\u2018restrictive theory\u2019 of sovereign immunity,\u201d under \nwhich \u201cthe immunity of the sovereign is recognized \nwith regard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) \nof a state, but not with respect to private acts (jure \ngestionis).\u201d  Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. \n677, 689-90 (2004).   \n\u201c[T]he change in State Department policy \nwrought by the \u2018Tate Letter\u2019 had little, if any impact \non federal courts\u2019 approach to immunity analyses\u201d be-\ncause \u201c \u2018[a]s in the past, initial responsibility for decid-\ning questions of sovereign immunity fell primarily \nupon the Executive acting through the State Depart-\n\n6 \n \nment,\u2019 and courts continued to \u2018abid[e] by\u2019 that De-\npartment\u2019s \u2018suggestions of immunity.\u2019 \u201d  Id. at 690 \n(quoting Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 487).   \nThe State Department\u2019s adoption of the restrictive \ntheory of sovereign immunity nevertheless \u201c \u2018thr[ew] \nimmunity determinations into some disarray,\u2019 since \n\u2018political considerations sometimes led the Depart-\nment to file suggestions of immunity in cases where \nimmunity would not have been available under the re-\nstrictive theory.\u2019 \u201d  Republic of Argentina v. NML Cap-\nital, Ltd., 573 U.S. 134, 141 (2014) (quoting Altmann, \n541 U.S. at 690).  And \u201cwhen in particular cases the \nState Department did not suggest immunity, courts \nmade immunity determinations \u2018generally by refer-\nence to prior State Department decisions.\u2019 \u201d  Ibid.   \nThus, between 1952 and 1976, \u201csovereign immun-\nity determinations were made in two different \nbranches, subject to a variety of factors, sometimes in-\ncluding diplomatic considerations\u201d and \u201cthe governing \nstandards were neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d  \nVerlinden, 461 U.S. at 488.   \n3.  In 1976, Congress and the President \u201cabated \nthe bedlam\u201d of the Tate Letter system by enacting the \nFSIA.  NML Capital, 573 U.S. at 141.  \u201cBy reason of \nits authority over foreign commerce and foreign rela-\ntions, Congress has the undisputed power to decide, \nas a matter of federal law, whether and under what \ncircumstances foreign nations should be amenable to \nsuit in the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 493.  \nCongress accordingly \u201cexercised its Article I powers by \nenacting a statute comprehensively regulating the \namenability of foreign nations to suit in the United \nStates\u201d\u2014the FSIA.  Ibid. (footnote omitted).   \n\n7 \n \nThe FSIA defines \u201cforeign state\u201d to \u201cinclud[e] a po-\nlitical subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or \ninstrumentality of a foreign state.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20091603(a).  It further defines an \u201cagency or instrumen-\ntality of a foreign state\u201d in relevant part as \u201cany en-\ntity\u201d \u201cwhich is a separate legal person, corporate or \notherwise,\u201d \u201ca majority of whose shares or other own-\nership interest is owned by a foreign state or political \nsubdivision thereof,\u201d and \u201cwhich is neither a citizen of \na State of the United States * * * nor created under \nthe laws of any third country.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u20091603(b). \nThe FSIA provides that \u201ca foreign state shall be \nimmune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the \nUnited States and of the States except as provided in \nsections 1605 to 1607 of this chapter.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20091604.  Section 1605, in turn, enumerates a series of \nexceptions for when \u201c[a] foreign state shall not be im-\nmune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United \nStates.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u20091605(a).  These include actions \u201cin which \nthe foreign state has waived its immunity,\u201d id. \n\u00a7\u20091605(a)(1), actions based on the \u201ccommercial activ-\nity\u201d of the foreign state, id. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(2), actions seek-\ning relief for injuries caused by terrorism, id. \u00a7\u20091605A, \nand \nactions \nto \nenforce \narbitral \nawards, \nid. \n\u00a7\u20091605(a)(6).  \nThe FSIA also governs service of process on a for-\neign state, including an instrumentality or agency of \na foreign state.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091608.  Section 1608 sets \nout \u201cstrict requirements\u201d that differ from the ordinary \nrules of service and that must be followed to effect ser-\nvice on a foreign state.  Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, \n587 U.S. 1, 19 (2019); Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(\u200aj) (\u201cA foreign \nstate * * * must be served in accordance with 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20091608.\u201d). \n\n8 \n \nFinally, the FSIA contains two provisions grant-\ning federal courts jurisdiction over cases against for-\neign states.  Section 1330(a) provides \u201csubject-matter \njurisdiction in federal courts\u201d whenever \u201ca suit falls \nwithin\u201d one of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions from immunity.  \nHarrison, 587 U.S. at 4 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091330(a)).  \nAnd Section 1330(b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdic-\ntion over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim\u201d \nwhere the federal court has subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion under Section 1330(a) and \u201cwhere service has \nbeen made under section 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091330(b). \n4.  This case arises from a dispute between Devas \nMultimedia Private Ltd. (Devas), an Indian corpora-\ntion, and Antrix Corp. Ltd., a corporation wholly \nowned by the Republic of India.  Pet.App. 17a.  India \ncreated Antrix as the commercial arm of India\u2019s De-\npartment of Space and the Indian Space Research Or-\nganization.  Pet.App. 53a.   \nDevas was incorporated by a group of American \ntelecommunications executives and investors to \nprovide satellite-carried telecommunications services \nin India.  Pet.App. 53a.  Devas and Antrix signed a \ncontract in which Antrix agreed to build, launch, and \noperate two government satellites and to lease S-band \nspectrum and transponders on those satellites to \nDevas.  Pet.App. 17a.  The agreement contained an \narbitration clause submitting disputes to arbitration \n\u201cin accordance with the rules and procedures of the \nICC (International Chamber of Commerce) or \nUNCITRAL.\u201d  Pet.App. 18a. \nThe Government of India later decided to retain \nthe spectrum for itself.  So it instructed Antrix to ter-\n\n9 \n \nminate the contract with Devas, which Antrix did.  \nPet.App. 18a.   \nDevas commenced an ICC arbitration, and the ar-\nbitral tribunal concluded that Antrix had wrongfully \nrepudiated its agreement.  Pet.App. 20a.  The panel \nissued Devas an award of $562.5 million plus interest.  \nPet.App. 20a. \n5.  Devas petitioned to confirm the award in the \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of Wash-\nington.  Pet.App. 20a.  Antrix moved to dismiss the \npetition, arguing (among other things) that the dis-\ntrict court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.  \nPet.App. 13a.  The parties \u201cd[id] not dispute that per-\nsonal jurisdiction exists as a matter of statute, but An-\ntrix maintain[ed] that it is entitled to additional, con-\nstitutional due process protections requiring a mini-\nmum contacts analysis.\u201d  Ibid.1   \nThe district court rejected this argument.  Relying \non decisions of the Second, Fifth, and D.C. Circuits, \nthe district court determined that foreign states are \nnot \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process Clause and that, \n\u201c[w]here the state exercises sufficient control over a \nforeign corporation, the due process clause does not \napply and statutory personal jurisdiction under the \nFSIA is all that is required.\u201d  Pet.App. 14a.   \nBecause the district court found that \u201c[t]he Gov-\nernment of India exercises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over An-\ntrix in a principal-agent relationship,\u201d it concluded \nthat \u201cAntrix is not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes\u201d \n \n1 Antrix did not dispute that the suit was properly venued in the \nWestern District of Washington based on its \u201cdoing business\u201d in \nthe district.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091391(f)(3).   \n\n10 \n \nand that it had personal jurisdiction under the FSIA.  \nPet.App. 13a-14a.  The district court also held, in the \nalternative, that even if Antrix were \u201centitled to due \nprocess protection, due process ha[d] been satisfied in \nthis case because [Antrix] possesses the requisite \n\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 with the United States.\u201d  Pet.App. \n22a.   \nThe district court rejected Antrix\u2019s other argu-\nments against confirmation (which are not relevant \nhere) and entered judgment in favor of Devas.  \nPet.App. 34a.  Antrix appealed. \n6.  While Antrix\u2019s appeal was pending, Antrix pe-\ntitioned a corporate-law tribunal in India to liquidate \nDevas based on unsubstantiated assertions that De-\nvas had procured the Devas-Antrix agreement \nthrough fraud\u2014assertions that Antrix had never \nraised in nearly a decade of arbitration and litigation.  \nPet.App. 54a-55a.  The next day, without permitting \nDevas to file a response, the Indian tribunal granted \nAntrix\u2019s petition and appointed an official liquidator \n(Liquidator), who is an employee of the Government \nof India, to seize control of Devas.  Ibid.   \nUpon seizing control of Devas, the Liquidator \nfired Devas\u2019s award-enforcement counsel throughout \nthe world and left Devas unrepresented in the district \ncourt and the Ninth Circuit for months.  Three of De-\nvas\u2019s shareholders and its Delaware subsidiary (Peti-\ntioners) intervened in both the district court and the \nNinth Circuit to defend and enforce the award.  \nPet.App. 54a-55a.   \nThe district court permitted Petitioners to conduct \npost-judgment discovery to locate Antrix\u2019s assets in \nthe United States, and that discovery revealed a claim \n\n11 \n \nthat Antrix held in a bankruptcy proceeding in the \nEastern District of Virginia.  Pet.App. 37a, 41a.  Over \nthe objection of both Antrix and the Liquidator (as-\nsertedly representing Devas), the district court per-\nmitted Petitioners to register the judgment in the \nEastern District of Virginia, and Petitioners gar-\nnished Antrix\u2019s claim in bankruptcy.  Ibid.  Both An-\ntrix and the Liquidator separately appealed from the \norder permitting registration of the judgment.  \nPet.App. 3a.2 \n7.  The Ninth Circuit decided all three appeals\u2014\nAntrix\u2019s appeal from the judgment and Antrix\u2019s and \nthe Liquidator\u2019s appeals from the registration order\u2014\non the ground that the district court lacked personal \njurisdiction over Antrix.  Pet.App. 3a-8a.   \nThe Ninth Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[t]he par-\nties agree that for purposes of the FSIA, Antrix is a \n\u2018foreign state,\u2019 service has been made, and an enumer-\n \n2  Meanwhile, in India, Antrix argued in its long-languishing \ncase to set aside the arbitral award that the Indian corporate-\nlaw tribunal\u2019s findings provided a new basis to set aside the \naward.  The Liquidator (purportedly acting for Devas) acquiesced \nin this argument.  CA9 (No. 20-36024) Dkt. 72, at 31; CA9 \n(No. 20-36024) Dkt. 85, at 21-40; see also CA9 (No. 22-35085) \nDkt. 24-2, at 4-6.  And the Indian court set aside the award.  \nPet.App. 55a.  Antrix then filed a motion for a limited remand \nfrom the Ninth Circuit.  Ibid.  But Antrix never moved the dis-\ntrict court for an indicative ruling to set aside the judgment.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60, 62.1.  Had Antrix done so, Petitioners would have \nopposed on the ground that the proceedings in India were \u201cre-\npugnant to fundamental notions of what is decent and just\u201d and \nnot entitled to respect in United States courts.  Corporaci\u00f3n Me-\nxicana de Mantenimiento Integral, S. de R.L. de C.V. v. Pemex-\nExploraci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n, 832 F.3d 92, 106 (2d Cir. 2016).  Be-\ncause these issues have yet to be presented to any U.S. court, \nthey have no bearing on the question presented. \n\n12 \n \nated exception [to sovereign immunity] applies.\u201d  \nPet.App. 4a.  But the panel nevertheless felt bound by \nNinth Circuit precedent engrafting an atextual mini-\nmum-contacts requirement onto the FSIA.   \nThe panel observed that in Thomas P. Gonzalez \nCorp. v. Consejo Nacional De Produccion De Costa \nRica, 614 F.2d 1247 (9th Cir. 1980), the Ninth Circuit \n\u201cheld that \u2018the legislative history of the Act confirms \nthat the reach of \u00a7\u20091330(b) does not extend beyond the \nlimits set by the International Shoe line of cases\u2019 \u201d and \n\u201crequires satisfaction of the traditional minimum con-\ntacts standard.\u201d  Pet.App. 4a (quoting Gonzalez, 614 \nF.2d at 1255) (cleaned up).  Based on Gonzalez and its \nprogeny, the Ninth Circuit held:  \u201cIt follows that if a \nforeign state is not a person and thus not entitled to a \nminimum contacts analysis through the Constitution, \nit is still entitled to a minimum contacts analysis \nthrough our reading of the FSIA.\u201d  Pet.App. 5a. \nThe Ninth Circuit panel accordingly concluded \nthat \u201cthe district court erred in ignoring our prece-\ndents requiring it to conduct a minimum contacts \nanalysis\u201d and that \u201c[t]he district court also erred in \nconcluding that Antrix has the requisite minimum \ncontacts with the United States.\u201d  Pet.App. 6a.  Be-\ncause it determined that the district court lacked per-\nsonal jurisdiction over Antrix, the Ninth Circuit re-\nversed the judgment against Antrix.  Pet.App. 8a.  \nAnd because there was no longer a judgment to regis-\nter, the panel also reversed the order permitting Peti-\ntioners to register the judgment in the Eastern Dis-\ntrict of Virginia.  Ibid. \nJudge Miller, joined by Judge Koh, wrote a con-\ncurrence joining the disposition based on existing \n\n13 \n \nNinth Circuit precedent.  Pet.App. 10a.  But the con-\ncurring judges argued that this \u201cprecedent applying \nthe minimum-contacts test to the exercise of personal \njurisdiction over foreign states has no foundation in \nthe Constitution or the FSIA\u201d and suggested the \nNinth Circuit should \u201creconsider it en banc.\u201d  \nPet.App. 10a-11a. \n8.  Petitioners and the Liquidator petitioned for \nrehearing en banc, but the Ninth Circuit denied those \npetitions over a dissent authored by Judge Bumatay \nand supported by six other circuit judges.  Pet.App. \n45a-46a.  The dissenting judges reasoned that the \nFSIA\u2019s clear text granted the district court personal \njurisdiction over Antrix.  Pet.App. 47a.  Because \u201csome \nof [the Ninth Circuit\u2019s] later precedents began couch-\ning [its] minimum-contacts inquiry as a constitutional \nrequirement,\u201d Pet.App. 62a\u2014as Antrix has argued \nthroughout the litigation\u2014the dissenting judges also \nexplained that \u201cnothing in the Constitution requires a \nminimum-contacts analysis either,\u201d Pet.App. 49a, \n62a. \n9.  Petitioners and the Liquidator both petitioned \nfor certiorari.  This Court granted both petitions and \nconsolidated the cases for briefing and oral argument. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.A.  When Congress enacted the Foreign Sov-\nereign Immunities Act, it established a comprehen-\nsive statutory framework governing the amenability \nof foreign states to suit in federal and state courts.  In \nthe FSIA, Congress provided that jurisdiction \u201cshall \nexist\u201d over \u201cevery claim\u201d against a foreign state in \nwhich (1) an enumerated exception to immunity ap-\n\n14 \n \nplies; and (2) the foreign state is properly served with \nprocess.  \nB.  The Ninth Circuit erroneously engrafted \nonto the FSIA a minimum-contacts requirement \nfound nowhere in the statutory text.  Its precedent \nrested not on the text of the FSIA\u2019s personal jurisdic-\ntion provision but instead on the FSIA\u2019s commercial-\nactivity immunity exception and on a House Commit-\ntee report.  The Ninth Circuit improperly allowed un-\nenacted legislative history, which it misinterpreted, to \ntrump the FSIA\u2019s clear text.  That holding was wrong. \nC.  The arbitral exception, the only alternate \ntextual basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \nthe FSIA, provides no support for a minimum-con-\ntacts standard.  It provides the express terms on \nwhich an arbitral award against a foreign state is en-\nforceable in the United States, with no mention of \nminimum contacts.  And the history of the enactment \nof the arbitral exception confirms that this proceeding \nwas precisely the type of enforcement allowable under \nthe FSIA. \nD.  The arbitral exception allows the United \nStates to comply with its obligations under various in-\nternational agreements requiring it to recognize arbi-\ntral awards.  Congress was aware of those obligations \nwhen it enacted the FSIA and the arbitral exception, \nand there is no basis to impose on the FSIA a reading \nthat would place the United States in violation of \nthose obligations. \nII.A.  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s minimum-contacts \nrequirement cannot be grounded in the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment either.  The original \nmeaning of the Due Process Clause makes clear that \nforeign states have no right to demand a showing of \n\n15 \n \nminimum contacts before being haled into a U.S. \ncourt.  The word \u201cperson\u201d in legal texts ordinarily is \ninterpreted to exclude sovereigns, and this Court does \nnot interpret the Constitution to accord due-process \nrights to the States of the Union. \nB. Even if foreign states were \u201cpersons\u201d entitled \nto \u201cprocess,\u201d the Due Process Clause permits the exer-\ncise of personal jurisdiction where Congress has so \nprovided regardless of whether the defendant has suf-\nficient minimum contacts with the United States.  \nThis Court has never required minimum contacts un-\nder the Fifth Amendment.  History provides no sup-\nport for such a requirement.  And the FSIA vastly ex-\nceeds whatever process may be due to foreign states.   \nC.  The structural relationship between the \nUnited States and foreign states and the history of \nU.S. foreign-relations law confirm that foreign states \ndo not enjoy a constitutional right to demand a show-\ning of minimum contacts.  Under basic principles of \ninternational law, disputes between juridically co-\nequal sovereign states are not determined by the in-\nternal law of either state but by the law of nations, \ninternational agreements, and principles of comity.  \nThere is therefore no reason to interpret the Due Pro-\ncess Clause to accord rights to foreign states\u2014who ex-\nist entirely outside our constitutional system\u2014beyond \nthose afforded by the political branches in the FSIA. \nIII.  Finally, interpreting the Due Process \nClause to accord foreign states a right to require proof \nof minimum contacts would contravene important leg-\nislative judgments of the political branches and call \nthe FSIA into constitutional doubt.  Congress deter-\nmined that certain plaintiffs\u2014victims of terrorism, \nthose harmed by certain commercial activities of for-\neign states, and holders of arbitral awards against for-\n\n16 \n \neign states\u2014are entitled to seek relief in this coun-\ntry\u2019s courts.  Congress\u2019s authority in this field is par-\namount, and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s refusal to defer to its \nforeign-policy judgments in the FSIA violates the sep-\naration of powers and undermines important national \ninterests. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe FSIA Does Not Require Minimum \nContacts \nTo \nEstablish \nPersonal \nJurisdiction. \nA. The FSIA\u2019s plain text precludes a \nminimum-contacts requirement. \nThe FSIA addresses subject matter and personal \njurisdiction in parallel provisions.  Section 1330(a) \ngrants district courts subject-matter jurisdiction over \nany claim against a foreign state when the require-\nments for an exception to immunity under the FSIA \nare satisfied.  And Section 1330(b) provides: \u201cPersonal \njurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have ju-\nrisdiction under subsection (a) where service has been \nmade under section 1608 of this title.\u201d  (emphasis \nadded). \nUnder any plausible reading of its statutory text, \nthe FSIA requires district courts to exercise personal \njurisdiction whenever there is subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion and service in accordance with Section 1608.  In \n\u201cevery\u201d case where those conditions are satisfied, per-\nsonal jurisdiction \u201cshall exist.\u201d  The word \u201cshall\u201d con-\nnotes a \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement.  Sebelius v. Auburn \nRegional Medical Center, 568 U.S. 145, 154 (2013).  \nAnd \u201cevery\u201d identifies \u201ceach individual or part of a \ngroup without exception.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New Collegiate \n\n17 \n \nDictionary 288 (1977 ed.) (emphasis added).  \u201c[I]t is \nhard to imagine a clearer statute.\u201d  Pet.App. 58a.  As \nthis Court explained decades ago, \u201c\u00a7\u20091330(b) provides \npersonal jurisdiction wherever [1] subject matter ju-\nrisdiction exists under subsection (a) and [2] service of \nprocess has been made under \u00a7\u20091608 of the Act.\u201d  Ver-\nlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, \n485 n.5 (1983) (emphasis added).   \nBy directly tying the scope of personal jurisdiction \nover foreign states to the scope of the substantive ex-\nceptions to immunity, the FSIA\u2019s text and structure \nmake personal jurisdiction coextensive with the Act\u2019s \nenumerated exceptions to immunity, so long as the \nplaintiff complies with Section 1608\u2019s reticulated ser-\nvice requirements to serve a foreign state.  Antrix it-\nself has conceded that the FSIA provides \u201cthat per-\nsonal jurisdiction exists where, in addition to proper \nservice, the textual requirements of an exception to \nimmunity set forth in [\u00a7]\u20091605 have been met.\u201d  Br. in \nOpp. 16.  And, other than the Ninth Circuit, every \ncourt of appeals to consider the issue has agreed.  See, \ne.g., Gater Assets Ltd. v. AO Moldovagaz, 2 F.4th 42, \n49 (2d Cir. 2021); TMR Energy Ltd. v. State Property \nFund of Ukraine, 411 F.3d 296, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2005); \nS & Davis International, Inc. v. Republic of Yemen, \n218 F.3d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir. 2000); Callejo v. Ban-\ncomer, S.A., 764 F.2d 1101, 1107 n.5 (5th Cir. 1985). \nThe FSIA\u2019s limitations on personal jurisdiction \nthus arise not from minimum-contacts requirements \nfound in many longarm statutes, see, e.g., Alaska Stat. \n\u00a7\u200909.05.015(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u200913-1-124(1); Conn. \nGen. Stat. \u00a7\u200952-59b; Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7\u20093104; Fla. \nStat. \u00a7\u200948.193; Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7\u20099-10-91, but from the \nstatute\u2019s strict limitations on subject matter jurisdic-\n\n18 \n \ntion and Section 1608\u2019s reticulated service require-\nments.  While other federal statutes allow service of \nprocess on a defendant \u201cwherever it may be found,\u201d 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u200953(a), the FSIA imposes \u201cstrict requirements\u201d \nfor service of process, Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, \n587 U.S. 1, 19 (2019), that allow service only through \nspecified means appropriate to a sovereign litigant, \nsuch as \u201cspecial arrangement[s]\u201d between the plaintiff \nand the defendant or \u201cin accordance with an applica-\nble international convention.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091608(a)(1)-\n(2), (b)(1)-(2).  And \u201cauthoriz[ing] service of process\u201d is \n\u201cCongress\u2019s typical mode of providing for the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction.\u201d  BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyr-\nrell, 581 U.S. 402, 409 (2017) (collecting statutes).   \nCongress having expressly imposed these two lim-\nitations on personal jurisdiction in the text of the \nFSIA, an additional, unwritten minimum-contacts re-\nquirement is \u201cnot to be implied.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. An-\ndrews, 534 U.S. 19, 28-29 (2001) (citation omitted).  \u201cIf \ncourts were authorized to add a fairness requirement \nto the implementation of federal statutes, judges \nwould be potent lawmakers indeed.  We do not\u2014we \ncannot\u2014add provisions to a federal statute.\u201d  Ala-\nbama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, 351-52 (2010).   \nB. The Ninth Circuit erred by engrafting a \nminimum-contacts requirement. \nThe Ninth Circuit has never purported to \n\u201cground\u201d its minimum-contacts requirement \u201cin the \ntext of \u00a7\u20091330(b).\u201d  Pet.App. 58a.  Nor could it, given \nthat the provision includes not a word about minimum \ncontacts.  Instead, the Ninth Circuit located a mini-\nmum-contacts requirement in the FSIA\u2019s immunity \nexception for commercial activity\u2014then expanded \n\n19 \n \nthat supposed requirement for one ground of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction into a requirement for personal ju-\nrisdiction in every circumstance covered by the Act.  \nIn addition to conflating subject-matter and personal \njurisdiction in this way, the Ninth Circuit sprinkled \non some inapposite legislative history.  Neither the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s statutory analysis nor its invocation of \nlegislative history provides any basis for imposing a \nminimum-contacts limitation on personal jurisdiction \nunder the FSIA. \n1.  The Ninth Circuit announced its minimum-\ncontacts requirement more than 40 years ago, holding \nthat \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction under the Act requires \nsatisfaction of the traditional minimum contacts \nstandard.\u201d  Thomas P. Gonzalez Corp. v. Consejo Na-\ncional de Produccion de Costa Rica (\u201cGonzalez\u201d), 614 \nF.2d 1247, 1255 (9th Cir. 1980).  It supported this \nholding with the \u201ctersest of reasoning.\u201d  Pet.App. 57a.   \nThe court first noted that \u201c[t]he words \u2018direct ef-\nfect\u2019 \u201d in the commercial-activity exception, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20091605(a)(2)\u2014\u201chave been interpreted as embodying \nthe minimum contacts standard of International \nShoe.\u201d  Gonzalez, 614 F.2d at 1255.  It then stated that \n\u201c[t]he legislative history of the Act confirms that the \nreach of \u00a7\u20091330(b) does not extend beyond the limits \nset by the International Shoe line of cases.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\u201cThat\u2019s the entirety of Gonzalez\u2019s textual analysis.\u201d  \nPet.App. 58a. \nThis analysis collapses on even minimal scrutiny.  \nTrue, the immunity exception for commercial activity \nrequires an assessment of the extent and nature of the \nforeign state\u2019s contacts with the United States.  See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(2).  But nothing in the text of the \n\n20 \n \ncommercial-activity exception even remotely suggests \nan incorporation of the International Shoe minimum-\ncontacts test that had been developed in an entirely \ndifferent context.  While some \u201ccircuits have sug-\ngested that the \u2018direct effects\u2019 analysis and \u2018minimum \ncontacts\u2019 test are related, * * * the Ninth Circuit ap-\npears to stand alone in expressly incorporating the \n\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 test wholesale.\u201d  Rote v. Zel Cus-\ntom Manufacturing LLC, 816 F.3d 383, 395 n.8 (6th \nCir. 2016).   \nNor is it obvious why the FSIA would adopt Inter-\nnational Shoe\u2019s standard, whether for the commercial-\nactivity exception or otherwise.  The International \nShoe standard is grounded in \u201cprinciples of \u2018interstate \nfederalism,\u2019 \u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judi-\ncial Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 368 (2021) (quoting World-\nWide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 293 \n(1980)), that \u201care a consequence of territorial limita-\ntions on the power of the respective States,\u201d Hanson \nv. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251 (1958).  Those concerns \nplay no role in suits in federal courts against foreign \nstates, as it is well-established that \u201cCongress has the \nauthority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d  EEOC v. Arabian \nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991), super-\nseded by statute on other grounds. \nEven if the commercial-activity exception did \nsomehow include a minimum-contacts requirement, \nother immunity exceptions\u2014the exception relating to \nwaivers of sovereign immunity, for example, see 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(1)\u2014most certainly do not.  To import \na minimum-contacts requirement into these other im-\nmunity exceptions would disregard Congress\u2019s careful \ndesign of those differing exceptions.  It likewise would \n\n21 \n \ninvert the principle that \u201c[w]here Congress includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but \nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is gen-\nerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \npurposely in the disparate inclusion.\u201d  Russello v. \nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983).  And, of course, \nthe existence of a minimum-contacts limitation on \nsubject-matter jurisdiction under the commercial-ac-\ntivity exception suggests no basis whatsoever for sep-\narately imposing the same limitation on the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction.  See Verlinden, 461 U.S. at \n488.   \nGonzalez\u2019s statutory analysis is not salvaged by \nits detour into the FSIA\u2019s legislative history.  \u201c[L]egis-\nlative history is not the law.\u201d  Epic Systems Corp. v. \nLewis, 584 U.S. 497, 523 (2018).  According to Gonza-\nlez, a House Committee report \u201cconfirms\u201d that Section \n1330(b) \u201cdoes not extend beyond the limits\u201d of Inter-\nnational Shoe.  614 F.2d at 1255.  But \u201cit is the stat-\nute, and not the Committee Report, which is the au-\nthoritative expression of the law.\u201d  City of Chicago v. \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, 511 U.S. 328, 337 \n(1994).  Nor could the House Committee report \u201ctrump \nclear statutory language.\u201d  National Ass\u2019n of Manufac-\nturers v. Department of Defense, 583 U.S. 109, 132 n.9 \n(2018) (cleaned up).  And the text of Section 1330(b) is \npellucid; it contains no minimum-contacts limitation \non personal jurisdiction. \nIn any event, Gonzalez misread the Committee \nReport on which it relied.  That report did not state \nthat Section 1330(b) always requires a showing of \nminimum contacts.  Instead, it expressed the Commit-\ntee\u2019s view that the enumerated \u201cimmunity provisions \nin the bill, sections 1605-1607\u201d\u2014one of which must \n\n22 \n \napply for subject-matter jurisdiction to exist under \nSection 1330(a)\u2014\u201crequire[e] some connection be-\ntween the lawsuit and the United States, or an ex-\npress or implied waiver by the foreign state of its im-\nmunity from jurisdiction.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at \n13-14 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, \n6612.  As a result, the Committee wrote, citing Inter-\nnational Shoe, the \u201crequirements of minimum juris-\ndictional contacts and adequate notice are embodied\u201d \nin Section 1330(b).  Ibid. \nThe Committee\u2019s acknowledgement that some of \nthe FSIA\u2019s then-enumerated exceptions to sovereign \nimmunity\u2014which Section 1330(b) incorporates by ref-\nerence\u2014require a connection with the United States \ndoes not mean that the FSIA\u2019s personal-jurisdiction \nprovision always requires a showing of sufficient min-\nimum contacts, even if the applicable exception to im-\nmunity requires no such contacts.  In concluding oth-\nerwise, \u201cGonzalez simply mixe[d] up subject-matter \njurisdiction and personal jurisdiction\u201d and \u201ccreate[d] \na universal minimum-contacts requirement for \n\u00a7\u20091330(b) [that] conflates the two concepts and makes \nno textual sense.\u201d  Pet.App. 59a. \nAnd if that were not enough, \u201cthe arbitral excep-\ntion\u201d at issue here \u201cwas added more than a decade af-\nter the Committee Report\u201d cited in Gonzalez, render-\ning the \u201capplication of a minimum-contacts test here \neven more dubious.\u201d  Pet.App. 62a. \nGonzalez\u2019s approach is, in short \u201ca relic from a by-\ngone era of statutory construction,\u201d Food Marketing \nInstitute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. 427, 437 \n(2019), unpersuasive even in its time, and inapplica-\nble here. \n\n23 \n \n2.  In the district court and on appeal, Antrix \n\u201cacknowledge[d] the statutory basis for personal juris-\ndiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091330(b)\u201d and \u201cd[id] not dis-\npute that personal jurisdiction exists as a matter of \nstatute.\u201d  Pet.App. 13a, 21a-22a.  Its certiorari-stage \nattempts to rehabilitate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s mini-\nmum-contacts requirement lack merit.  See Br. in \nOpp. 13-20. \nAntrix begins, not with the text of Section 1330(b), \nbut with a grab bag of legislative history.  It cites, for \nexample, materials from a \u201ccongressional hearin[g] \nyears earlier on a different bill that was never enacted \ninto law.\u201d  Food Marketing Institute, 588 U.S. at 437; \nsee Br. in Opp. 14 (quoting 1973 hearing report).  It \nblock quotes testimony from a non-lawmaker\u2014\n\u201camong the least illuminating forms of legislative his-\ntory.\u201d  Food Marketing Institute, 588 U.S. at 437 (cita-\ntion omitted); see Br. in Opp. 15.  And it launders the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s legislative history by quoting a law re-\nview article quoting the same inapposite Committee \nReport.  See Br. in Opp. 14 (quoting Mary Kay Kane, \nSuing Foreign Sovereigns:  A Procedural Compass, 34 \nStan. L. Rev. 385, 396 n.64 (Jan. 1982)). \n\u201cAnd even those lowly sources speak at best indi-\nrectly to the precise question here.\u201d  Advocate Health \nCare Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.S. 468, 481 (2017).  \nEach suggests only that certain of the FSIA\u2019s original \nexceptions required some connection to the United \nStates for purposes of subject-matter jurisdiction.  \nNone trumps\u2014or even illuminates\u2014the plain and un-\nambiguous text of Section 1330(b). \nWhen Antrix turns to the text, it concedes the ar-\ngument:  \u201c[W]hat section 1330(b) provides is that per-\n\n24 \n \nsonal jurisdiction exists where, in addition to proper \nservice, the textual requirements of an exception to \nimmunity set forth in section 1605 have been met.\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16.  Because those requirements are not \nin dispute, the FSIA\u2019s personal jurisdiction require-\nments are satisfied. \nTo evade that conclusion, Antrix merely points \nout that some of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions \u201crequire some \nconnection\u201d between the parties, the dispute, and the \nUnited States.  Br. in Opp. 17.  This just repeats the \nerrors of Antrix\u2019s sources.  Antrix cannot point to any \nexception requiring International Shoe minimum con-\ntacts with the United States.  See id. at 17-20.  And \neven if it could locate such a requirement in some im-\nmunity exceptions, it would not follow that minimum \ncontacts are always required.  Antrix does not even \npurport to find such a requirement in the text of the \narbitral exception.  Instead, it resorts\u2014again\u2014to \nhearing testimony from someone who was not even a \nmember of Congress.  See id. at 19. \nC. The arbitral exception does not require \nminimum contacts. \nBecause a minimum-contacts requirement cannot \nbe interpolated into Section 1330(b) itself, the decision \nbelow could be affirmed only if such a requirement \ncould be located in the text of the arbitral exception.  \nBut that text contains no such requirement.  The ar-\nbitral exception confers jurisdiction over any action \n\u201cto confirm an award made pursuant to * * * an agree-\nment to arbitrate.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(6).  And it ap-\nplies whenever \u201cthe agreement or award is or may be \ngoverned by a treaty or other international agreement \nin force for the United States calling for the recogni-\n\n25 \n \ntion and enforcement of arbitral awards.\u201d  Ibid.  The \narbitral exception does not require any greater nexus \nwith the United States. \nIn fact, the legislative and statutory history of the \narbitral exception confirms that it does not require a \nminimum-contacts showing.  The Committee Report \non which Gonzalez relied, for example, observed in \ndiscussing the waiver exception to sovereign immun-\nity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(1), that \u201ccourts have found \n[implicit] waivers in cases where a foreign state has \nagreed to arbitration in another country.\u201d  H.R. Rep. \nNo. 94-1487, at 18.  Although the FSIA originally did \nnot include an arbitral exception, some expected \u201car-\nbitration awards to be executed against the commer-\ncial assets of foreign states under Sections 1605(a)(1) \nand 1610(a)(1) of the Act,\u201d i.e., the waiver exceptions.3   \nProving that expectations based on legislative his-\ntory are ill-founded, courts expressed \u201cuncertainty\u201d \nand \u201cconfusion\u201d about whether and when \u201can agree-\nment to international arbitration constitutes a waiver \nof sovereign immunity.\u201d  1986 House Hearing at 95.  \nEnacted text, not legislative history, was needed \u201cto \nclarify the jurisdiction of the federal courts to enforce \narbitration agreements with and arbitral awards \n \n3 Arbitral Awards: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Admin-\nistrative Law & Governmental Relations of the Committee on the \nJudiciary, 99th Cong. 89, 92 (1986) (\u201c1986 House Hearing\u201d) \n(statement of Mark B. Feldman, Chairman, Ad Hoc Committee \non Revision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, American \nBar Association); see Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations \nLaw \u00a7\u2009456 (1987) (\u201cUnder the law of the United States * * * an \nagreement to arbitrate is a waiver of immunity from jurisdiction \nin * * * an action to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant \nto the agreement.\u201d).  \n\n26 \n \nmade against foreign states and government agen-\ncies.\u201d  Id. at 92.   \nIn drafting the text that would eventually become \nthe arbitral exception, its proponents expressly re-\njected \u201cminimum contacts\u201d objections.  1986 House \nHearing at 95.  Such objections \u201cignore[d],\u201d for exam-\nple, that the arbitral exception rested on an implicit \n\u201cwaive[r].\u201d  Id. at 95, 97-98.4  The arbitral exception \nthus allowed enforcement against a foreign state not \npresent in the United States\u2014even when \u201cthe under-\nlying transaction has no connection with the United \nStates.\u201d  Id. at 95. \nThus, the arbitral exception\u2019s legislative history \nonly confirms what the plain text provides:  There is \nno basis for imposing a minimum-contacts require-\nment upon it.  And the fact that Congress was aware \nof minimum-contacts objections and declined to re-\nquire minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction un-\nderscores that it was a \u201cdeliberate choice, not inad-\nvertence.\u201d  Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. 223, \n232-33 (2011) (citation omitted). \n \n4 Accord, e.g., 1986 House Hearing at 32 (statement of Elizabeth \nG. Verville, Acting Legal Adviser, Dep\u2019t of State) (\u201c[T]he amend-\nment would clarify the law that is emerging from a body of cases \non implicit waiver.\u201d); Id. at 184-85 (statement of Cecil J. \nOlmstead, The National Foreign Trade Council) (\u201c[I]t is im-\nportant that Congress ensure that its previously stated position \non implied waivers, at least as to enforcement of arbitral awards, \nbe enacted into law to ensure that courts do not follow misguided \ndecisions as precedents in the future.\u201d). \n\n27 \n \nD. Requiring minimum contacts would \nviolate the United States\u2019s international \nobligations. \nAdopting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of the FSIA \nwould place the United States in conflict with other \nnations on the enforceability of arbitral awards and \nthe obligations imposed by international conventions \ngoverning arbitral enforcement.  Those conventions \npre-dated the enactment of the FSIA and of the arbi-\ntral exception, and there is no basis to impute to Con-\ngress an intent to place the United States in violation \nof those obligations. \nDevas\u2019s arbitration against Antrix is enforceable \nunder the New York Convention, in which contracting \nstates commit to enforce arbitral awards arising out \nof commercial relationships.  N.Y. Convention, \nArt. I(3).  The Convention directs that \u201cEach Con-\ntracting State shall recognize arbitral awards as bind-\ning and enforce them.\u201d  Id. Art. III; 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u2009207.  \nOther international conventions impose similar obli-\ngations.  See, e.g., 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u2009301-07 (Inter-American \nConvention on International Commercial Arbitra-\ntion); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091650a (International Centre for Set-\ntlement of Investment Disputes \u201cICSID\u201d Convention).   \nThus, if the FSIA is read to require a minimum-\ncontacts showing before foreign states may be haled \ninto court in the United States, the United States may \nbe in violation of its obligation to enforce awards.    \nCongress was aware of this risk when it enacted the \narbitral exception, and the importance of the United \nStates\u2019s obligation to recognize such awards was a \ndriving factor in the enactment of the arbitral excep-\ntion.  See 1986 House Hearing, at 98 (\u201cAny other con-\n\n28 \n \nclusion would impede the United States from dis-\ncharging its obligations under the New York Conven-\ntion to enforce foreign arbitral awards.\u201d).  Given that \nbackground, it would upend ordinary rules of statu-\ntory construction to interpret Section 1330(b) to place \nthe United States in violation of its obligation under \nthese conventions.  See Restatement (Third) of For-\neign Relations Law \u00a7\u2009114 (1987); Murray v. Schooner \nCharming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804).  \nMoreover, by acceding to these Conventions, a for-\neign state has also agreed that it may be subject to \nenforcement proceedings in other contracting states, \nincluding the United States.  As courts in other com-\nmon law countries have explained, \u201cContracting \nStates have submitted to the jurisdiction\u201d of other \nContracting States by acceding to these conventions \n\u201cand therefore may not oppose the registration of [ar-\nbitral] awards against them on the grounds of state \nimmunity.\u201d  Infrastructure Services Luxembourg \nS.\u00c0.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain, No. CA-2023-001556, \n\u00b6 103 (Court of Appeals (Eng. & Wales) Oct. 22, 2024); \nsee also Kingdom of Spain v. Infrastructure Services \nLuxembourg S.\u00c0.R.L., [2023] HCA 11, \u00b6 8 (High Court \nof Austl. Apr. 12, 2023) (\u201cthe effect of Spain\u2019s agree-\nment to [the ICSID Convention] amounted to a waiver \nof foreign State immunity from the jurisdiction of the \ncourts of Australia to recognize and enforce\u201d award \nagainst Spain).   \nIf a minimum-contacts requirement is read into \nthe FSIA, however, other foreign states will have de-\nfenses available in U.S. courts that are entirely una-\nvailable to the United States in foreign courts.  There \nis no basis for interpreting the FSIA to impose that \ndisuniformity. \n\n29 \n \n* \n* \n* \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the FSIA re-\nquires a showing of minimum contacts flies in the face \nof the Act\u2019s text, history, and structure, and threatens \nto place the United States in violation of its interna-\ntional obligations.  This Court should reverse and \nmake clear the FSIA requires only an applicable ex-\nception to immunity and proper service of process to \ncreate personal jurisdiction\u2014exactly what its plain \ntext provides. \nII. The Due Process Clause Does Not Require \nMinimum Contacts To Establish Personal \nJurisdiction. \nAlthough the panel in this case purported to rest \nits holding on statutory grounds, Antrix has argued \nthat it is entitled to a minimum-contacts analysis as a \nconstitutional matter.  And Ninth Circuit precedent, \nundisturbed by the panel\u2019s opinion, holds that in FSIA \nactions \u201ca court must consider whether the constitu-\ntional constraints of the Due Process clause preclude \nthe assertion of personal jurisdiction\u201d by reference to \n\u201cthe traditional minimum contacts standard.\u201d  Grego-\nrian v. Izvestia, 871 F.2d 1515, 1529 (9th Cir. 1989); \nsee Pet.App. 5a (declining to depart from prior Ninth \nCircuit precedent notwithstanding Republic of Argen-\ntina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 619 (1992)).   \nThat outlier view conflicts with the views of every \ncourt of appeals to consider this question since Wel-\ntover, see Pet. 11-14, and would render Section \n1330(b) unconstitutional.  This Court should resolve \nthe conflict among the circuits and hold that Section \n1330(b) is constitutional. \n\n30 \n \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does \nnot require a showing of minimum contacts for the as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction over a foreign state for \nat least two reasons.  First, a foreign state is not a \n\u201cperson\u201d capable of invoking the Due Process Clause.  \nSecond, and more fundamentally, the political \nbranches have authority under the Fifth Amendment \nto define by statute the process that is \u201cdue\u201d in this \narea of international relations.  Congress and the \nPresident, by enacting the FSIA\u2019s comprehensive \nframework governing civil litigation against foreign \nstates (including their agencies and instrumentali-\nties), far exceeded any constitutional minimum re-\nquired by the Fifth Amendment for the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. \nA. Foreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d within \nthe meaning of the Due Process Clause. \nA foreign state is not a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to due \nprocess under the Fifth Amendment.  As this Court \nhas explained, there is an \u201coften-expressed under-\nstanding that in common usage, the term \u2018person\u2019 does \nnot include the sovereign.\u201d  Will v. Michigan Depart-\nment of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 64 (1989).  For that \nreason, \u201cstatutes employing the word are ordinarily \nconstrued to exclude it.\u201d  Ibid.  And, in South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, this Court held as a constitutional \nmatter that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, \nby any reasonable mode of interpretation, be ex-\npanded to encompass the States of the Union.\u201d  383 \nU.S. 301, 323-24 (1966). \nWhen this Court was confronted with the ques-\ntion whether foreign states are entitled to more due \nprocess protection than States of the Union, it \n\n31 \n \n\u201c[a]ssum[ed], without deciding, that a foreign state is \na \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  \nWeltover, 504 U.S. at 619.  But it suggested that as-\nsumption was not correct by citing Katzenbach\u2019s hold-\ning that \u201cStates of the Union are not \u2018persons\u2019 for the \npurposes of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Ibid. (citing Kat-\nzenbach, 383 U.S. at 323-24). \nThat assumption was not correct.  It is in fact \u201cun-\nlikely that the framers of the Fifth Amendment would \nhave viewed foreign states as persons\u201d within the \nmeaning of an Amendment guaranteeing due process \nin connection with civil lawsuits \u201cgiven that foreign \nsovereigns were treated as completely immune from \nsuit at the time of the founding.\u201d  Donald Earl Chil-\ndress III, Questioning the Constitutional Rights of \nForeign Nations, 88 Fordham L. Rev. Online 60, 70 \n(2019).  \u201cGiven this absolute immunity, foreign states \nwould not need to be persons protected by any process \nunder the Fifth Amendment because at that time they \nwere absolutely immune from all process.\u201d  Ibid.   \nAfter all, as Alexander Hamilton put it, it \u201cis in-\nherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable \nto the suit of an individual without its consent.  This \nis the general sense, and the general practice of man-\nkind.\u201d  The Federalist No. 81, at 548-49 (Alexander \nHamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). \nChief Justice Marshall expanded on this point in \nThe Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. (7 \nCranch) 116 (1812).  There, he explained that the \u201cju-\nrisdiction of the nation within its own territory is nec-\nessarily exclusive and absolute\u201d and \u201cis susceptible of \nno limitation not imposed by itself.\u201d  Id. at 136.  As a \ncorollary, the \u201cfull and absolute territorial jurisdiction \n\n32 \n \n* * * of every sovereign\u201d did not \u201ccontemplate foreign \nsovereigns nor their sovereign rights as its objects.\u201d  \nId. at 137.  To the contrary, under then-prevailing \u201cus-\nages and received obligations,\u201d a \u201csovereign being in \nno respect amenable to another\u201d would \u201center a for-\neign territory only under an express license\u201d or confi-\ndent that sovereign immunity would be \u201creserved by \nimplication, and [would] be extended to him.\u201d  Ibid. \n\u201cIf, as Schooner Exchange suggests, the assertion \nof jurisdiction against a foreign sovereign was unim-\naginable, it is very difficult to argue that the framers \nintended that foreign sovereigns would require the \nprotection of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d  Joseph W. Glan-\nnon & Jeffery Atik, Politics and Personal Jurisdiction: \nSuing State Sponsors of Terrorism Under the 1996 \nAmendments to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, \n87 Georgetown L.J. 675, 692 (1999).  Moreover, \u201cit \nwould seem anomalous for a new nation to inaugurate \nits foreign policy by gratuitously adopting constraints \non its foreign policy power which are not reciprocated \nby other states.\u201d  Ibid. \nIt would be equally anomalous for the new United \nStates \u201cto afford greater Fifth Amendment rights to \nforeign nations, who are entirely alien to our constitu-\ntional system, than are afforded to the states, who \nhelp make up the very fabric of that system.\u201d  Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 96 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  As \u201cintegral and active partic-\nipants in the Constitution\u2019s infrastructure\u201d the States \nof the Union \u201cboth derive important benefits and must \nabide by significant limitations as a consequence of \ntheir participation.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n33 \n \nThe States of the Union, for example, benefit from \nthe protections the federal military provides against \nhostile foreign states, see U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u20098, cl. 10-\n14, and from \u201ca national market for competition un-\ndisturbed by preferential advantages conferred by a \nState upon its residents or resident competitors,\u201d Gen-\neral Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 299 (1997).  \nIn exchange for these benefits, the Constitution pro-\nhibits the States from engaging in certain acts, see \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u200910, and it provides that state law \nshall be preempted to the extent that it is inconsistent \nwith federal law, id. art. VI, cl. 2.  \nIn contrast, a \u201cforeign State lies outside the struc-\nture of the Union.\u201d  Principality of Monaco v. State of \nMississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 (1934).  \u201c[T]he Consti-\ntution does not limit foreign states, as it does the \nStates of the Union, in the power they can exert \nagainst the United States or its government.\u201d  Price, \n294 F.3d at 97.  And \u201cthe federal government cannot \ninvoke the Constitution, save possibly to declare war, \nto prevent a foreign nation from taking action adverse \nto the interest of the United States or to compel it to \ntake action favorable to the United States.\u201d  Ibid.  It \nwould thus \u201cbe quite strange to interpret the Due Pro-\ncess Clause as conferring upon [foreign states] rights \nand protections against the power of [the] federal gov-\nernment\u201d that the Constitution denies to the States of \nthe Union.  Ibid.; accord Abelesz v. Magyar Nemzeti \nBank, 692 F.3d 661, 694 (7th Cir. 2012); Frontera Re-\nsources Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan \nRepublic, 582 F.3d 393, 399 (2d Cir. 2009). \nAs against this Nation\u2019s government, the inter-\nests of foreign nations are addressed through \u201ccomity \nand international law,\u201d not the Due Process Clause.  \n\n34 \n \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 97.  And because foreign states are \nnot \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to due process, Antrix is \u201cnot a \n\u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes\u201d because it is the al-\nter ego of its parent sovereign, the Republic of India.  \nPet.App. 13a. \nB. The political branches have provided all \nthe process that is due to a foreign state. \nEven if foreign states (or their agencies or instru-\nmentalities) were \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to due process, \nthe Fifth Amendment still would not require mini-\nmum contacts for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  \nTo the contrary, the FSIA\u2019s careful and reticulated \nframework more than satisfies any due process re-\nquirements. \n1.  This Court has never held that the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment incorporates Interna-\ntional Shoe\u2019s minimum-contacts requirement.  Ra-\nther, the Court has repeatedly left \u201copen the question \nwhether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same re-\nstrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a \nfederal court\u201d as the Fourteen Amendment imposes on \nthat of a state court.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Su-\nperior Court of California, 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); \nsee also J. McIntyre, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, \n885 (2011) (plurality) (It \u201cmay be that * * * Congress \ncould authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appro-\npriate courts\u201d though a state could not.).  As the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments \u201cwere ingrafted upon \nthe Constitution at different times and in widely dif-\nferent circumstances of our national life, it may be \nthat questions may arise in which different construc-\ntions and applications of their provisions may be \nproper.\u201d  French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., 181 \nU.S. 324, 328 (1901). \n\n35 \n \nThose differences are particularly sharp with re-\nspect to personal jurisdiction.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, the constitutional \u201crestrictions on personal \njurisdiction\u201d that the Court has enforced under the \nFourteenth Amendment \u201c \u2018are more than a guarantee \nof immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation.  \nThey are a consequence of territorial limitations on \nthe power of the respective States.\u2019 \u200a\u201d  Bristol-Myers \nSquibb, 582 U.S. at 263 (emphasis added).  Although \nStates retain \u201cthe sovereign power to try causes in \ntheir courts,\u201d the \u201csovereignty of each State * * * im-\nplie[s] a limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister \nStates.\u201d  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, \n444 U.S. 286, 293 (1980).   \nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause thus \u201cact[s] as an instrument of interstate fed-\neralism.\u201d  Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263.  And \nthe \u201climitation\u201d it imposes is \u201cexpress or implicit in \nboth the original scheme of the Constitution and the \nFourteenth Amendment,\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, \n444 U.S. at 293. \nThere is no reason to conclude that the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause acts the same way \nor imposes the same restrictions on the sovereign \npower of the United States to try causes in its courts \nagainst foreign states or their agencies or instrumen-\ntalities.  The Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with \ninterstate federalism.  See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. \n228, n.23 (1979) (\u201capplication of the Fifth Amend-\nment\u201d does not \u201cserve the purposes of federalism\u201d).  \nAnd nothing in the original scheme of the Constitu-\ntion or the Fifth Amendment limits the national sov-\nereignty of the United States with respect to foreign \nstates.  Rather, as was understood at the founding, \n\n36 \n \n\u201cthe jurisdiction of a nation within its own territory \u2018is \nsusceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself,\u2019 \u201d \nand the protections given to foreign states are \u201ca mat-\nter of grace and comity on the part of the United \nStates, and not a restriction imposed by the Constitu-\ntion.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 486; see also Congres-\nsional Power to Provide for the Vesting of Iranian De-\nposits in Foreign Branches of United States Banks, 4A \nOp. OLC 365, 368 (1980) (The \u201crights of foreign states \nin this country depend not on constitutional protec-\ntions, but on treaties, international custom, and such \nprivileges as this nation extends under principles of \ncomity.\u201d).  Transplanting the minimum-contacts re-\nquirement into the Fifth Amendment makes little \nsense. \n2.  Unsurprisingly, the early \u201c[c]ases involving \nforeign states provide no support for extending the \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 analy-\nsis to the Fifth Amendment.\u201d  Ingrid Wuerth, The Due \nProcess and Other Constitutional Rights of Foreign \nNations, 88 Fordham L. Rev. 633, 683 (2019).  Rather, \nthey \u201csuggest that the Constitution itself does not dic-\ntate the rules governing personal jurisdiction, \nwhether as a function of Article III or the Fifth \nAmendment.\u201d  Ibid.  In short, the original understand-\ning reflected in those cases indicates that \u201cCongress \ncould extend personal jurisdiction and abrogate the \nimmunity of foreign states if it wanted to do so.\u201d  Ibid.   \nTo the extent courts at the founding considered \noverarching restrictions on personal jurisdiction, they \ngrounded those restrictions in \u201cgeneral and interna-\ntional law\u201d but those were \u201crules that could be altered \nby federal statute, with no obvious constitutional con-\nstraint.\u201d  Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdic-\n\n37 \n \ntion of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1711 \n(2020); see also Service of Process on a British Ship-\nof-War, 1 U.S. Op. Atty. Gen. 87, 91-92 (1799) (recog-\nnizing Congress\u2019s legislative power to authorize ser-\nvice of process aboard foreign vessel). \nFor example, Justice Washington, riding circuit, \nexplained that \u201cgeneral principles of law, which our \ncourts acknowledge as rules of decision,\u201d provided \nthat federal courts had \u201cno authority, generally, to is-\nsue process into another district, except in cases \nwhere such authority has been specially bestowed, by \nsome law of the United States.\u201d  Ex parte Graham, 10 \nF. Cas. 911, 912 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818).  He reasoned \nthat, \u201cshould it be the will of congress to vest in the \ncourts of the United States an extra-territorial juris-\ndiction in prize causes, over persons and things found \nin a district other than that from which the process \nissued,\u201d the courts would be bound to follow Con-\ngress\u2019s instruction.  Id. at 913; see id. (\u201cthe exercise of \njurisdiction over persons not inhabitants of, or found \nwithin the district where the suit is brought\u201d presents \n\u201cdifficulties, which, in the opinion of the court, nothing \nbut an act of congress can remove\u201d).   \nJustice Story applied the same reasoning in Pic-\nquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828).  \nThere, the plaintiff attempted to subject a U.S. citizen \nresiding in France to the circuit court\u2019s in personam \njurisdiction by attaching property of the nonresident \ndefendant in Massachusetts.  Id. at 609-10.  Justice \nStory concluded that the circuit court could not exer-\ncise jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant\u2014but \nhe reached that decision \u201cas a matter of general law \nand statute, not as something regulated by the Con-\nstitution.\u201d  Sachs, supra, 106 Va. L. Rev. at 1714. \n\n38 \n \nInterpreting a provision in the Judiciary Act of \n1789 providing that suits against an inhabitant of the \nUnited States must be brought in the district where \nhe is an inhabitant or where he is found, Justice Story \nrejected the argument that this provision\u2014because it \nmade no such restriction for non-inhabitants\u2014implic-\nitly authorized proceedings against a foreigner in any \ndistrict.  Picquet, 19 F. Cas. at 613.  He concluded that \nthe statute did not because \u201c[s]uch an intention, so re-\npugnant to the general rights and sovereignty of other \nnations, ought not to be presumed, unless it is estab-\nlished by irresistible proof.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).   \nCritically, Justice Story explained that though \nCongress had not authorized service in Picquet, Con-\ngress had the authority to do so if it so chose.  Thus, if \nCongress had ordered \u201ca subject of England, or France \nor Russia, * * * be summoned from the other end of \nthe globe to obey our process,\u201d the court \u201cwould cer-\ntainly be bound to follow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d  \nPicquet, 19 F. Cas. at 613, 615. \nThis Court adopted Justice Story\u2019s reasoning in \nToland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838).  That \nplaintiff attempted to subject a citizen of Massachu-\nsetts residing in Gibraltar to the personal jurisdiction \nof a Pennsylvania circuit court by attaching the non-\nresident\u2019s Pennsylvania property.  Id. at 302.  The \nquestion was \u201cwhether the process of foreign attach-\nment can be properly used in the circuit courts of the \nUnited States, in cases where the defendant is domi-\nciled abroad, and not found within the district in \nwhich the process issues, so that it can be served upon \nhim.\u201d  Id. at 327.  This Court explained that the \u201can-\nswer to this question must be found\u201d not in the mean-\ning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\n\n39 \n \nment, but \u201cin the construction of the 11th section of \nthe judiciary act of 1789, as influenced by the true \nprinciples of interpretation; and by the course of leg-\nislation on the subject.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThis Court noted that it \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Pic-\nquet\u2019s recitation of the issue as one of positive law.  To-\nland, 37 U.S. at 328.  The Court acknowledged that \n\u201cCongress might have authorized civil process from \nany circuit court, to have run into any state of the Un-\nion\u201d but, as in Picquet, concluded that \u201c[i]t has not \ndone so.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  This Court agreed \nwith Justice Story in Picquet that if \u201ccongress acted \nunder the idea that the process of the circuit courts \ncould reach persons in a foreign jurisdiction,\u201d then it \nwould be bound to enforce the law, but that \u201cinde-\npendently of positive legislation, the process can only \nbe served upon persons within the same districts.\u201d  Id. \nat 330 (emphasis added). \n3.  In light of that early history, as Judge Buma-\ntay explained, \u201can emerging consensus shows that the \noriginal understanding of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause does not require minimum contacts for \nforeign states.\u201d  Pet.App. 66a.   \nUnder the Fifth Amendment, a \u201cfederal long-arm \nprovision,\u201d such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091330(b), \u201cif within Con-\ngress\u2019s enumerated powers, establishes territorial ju-\nrisdiction to the satisfaction of the courts; the due pro-\ncess objection to a judgment-without-jurisdiction can \nnever get started.\u201d  Sachs, supra, 106 Va. L. Rev. at \n1709.  \u201cBecause the Due Process of Law Clause re-\nquires process, * * * service on a defendant\u201d may be \n\u201csufficient to validate personal jurisdiction whether or \nnot the International Shoe Co. v. Washington mini-\n\n40 \n \nmum contacts test was satisfied.\u201d  Max Crema & Law-\nrence B. Solum, The Original Meaning of \u201cDue Process \nof Law\u201d in the Fifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, \n530-31 (2022) (emphasis added). \nEven the leading proponent of the argument that \n\u201chistorical sources show that foreign states were \nviewed as \u2018persons\u2019 entitled to \u2018process,\u2019 \u201d agrees that \n\u201cthe content of those due process protections is a dis-\ntinct issue.\u201d  Wuerth, supra, 88 Fordham L. Rev. at \n637.  The \u201cbest reading may be that Congress controls \nthe content of personal jurisdiction protections due to \nall defendants under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d  Ibid. \nIn short, the early cases suggest that \u201cso long as \nCongress expressly authorized such expansive pro-\ncess, Fifth Amendment due process does not impose \nconstitutional limits on federal courts\u2019 exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d  Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Ka-\nbushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 262 (5th Cir. 2022) (El-\nrod, J., dissenting); see also id. at 284 (Oldham, J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201c[A]s originally understood, the Fifth \nAmendment did not impose any limits on the personal \njurisdiction of the federal courts.\u201d). \nThe contrary view articulated by some courts of \nappeals\u2014that \u201cthe standards developed in the Four-\nteenth Amendment context must govern under the \nFifth Amendment,\u201d Douglass, 46 F.4th at 238\u2014rests \non the pure ipse dixit that the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments must be coterminous.  But the historical \nbackdrop of the Fifth Amendment and the absence of \nany interstate federalism concerns refute that conclu-\nsion.  And they counsel great caution, at a minimum, \nbefore this Court extends the rule of International \nShoe, with all its confusion and shortcomings, into the \n\n41 \n \nrealm of the Fifth Amendment.  Cf. Burnham v. Supe-\nrior Ct. of Cal., 495 U.S. 604, 619 (1990) (plurality) \n(International Shoe\u2019s test does not displace the \u201ccon-\ntinuing traditions of our legal system that define the \ndue process standard of \u2018traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d) \n4.  Of course, concluding that the Fifth Amend-\nment does not require minimum contacts does not \nmean that anything goes.  Due process generally re-\nquires \u201cnotice and an opportunity to be heard before \nthe Government deprives [defendants] of property.\u201d  \nUnited States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, \n510 U.S. 43, 48 (1993); see also Toland, 37 U.S. at 329 \n(noting importance of process and right of appear-\nance).  And \u201cin the absence of valid service of process, \npersonal jurisdiction would violate the Due Process of \nLaw Clause\u201d\u2014under the Fourteenth or the Fifth \nAmendment.  Crema & Solum, supra, 108 Va. L. Rev. \nat 531. \nThe FSIA extends protections far beyond that \nminimum.  Congress\u2019s comprehensive scheme pro-\nvides not only protective \u201cstrict requirements\u201d for ser-\nvice, Harrison, 587 U.S. at 19; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091608(a)-(c), \nbut also protection from default judgment, id. \n\u00a7\u20091608(e), protection from punitive damages, id. \n\u00a7\u20091606, limitations on liability \u201cto the same extent as \na private individual\u201d, id., presumptive immunity from \nsuit, id. \u00a7\u20091604, and immunity from attachment, id. \n\u00a7\u20091609.  That goes well beyond notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard.  In the field of foreign relations \nwhere the political branches are at the apex of their \npower, infra 46-47, the Constitution gives no directive \nfor the judiciary to alter the comprehensive system \n\n42 \n \nthe political branches have devised by imposing a \nminimum-contacts requirement.   \nC. A minimum-contacts test fails to account \nfor the nature of the relationship \nbetween the United States and foreign \nstates. \nWhen the United States interacts with foreign \nsovereigns, it exercises inherent authority that pre-\ndates and does not depend on the Constitution.  In this \nrealm, the political branches are supreme.  The Due \nProcess Clause offers no basis for the judiciary to sup-\nplement the reticulated framework erected by Con-\ngress and the President in the FSIA with the regime \nof International Shoe. \n1.  This Court has long distinguished \u201cbetween the \npowers of the federal government in respect of foreign \nor external affairs and those in respect of domestic or \ninternal affairs.\u201d  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-\nport Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 315 (1936).  Although the fed-\neral government\u2019s domestic powers are limited to \n\u201cthose specifically enumerated in the Constitution, and \nsuch implied powers as are necessary and proper to \ncarry into effect the enumerated powers,\u201d its foreign af-\nfairs power is not.  Id. at 316.  That latter power preex-\nisted the Constitution and \u201cimmediately passed to the \nUnion\u201d once \u201cthe external sovereignty of Great Britain \nin respect of the colonies ceased.\u201d  Id. at 317. \nAccordingly, \u201cinvestment of the federal govern-\nment with the powers of external sovereignty did not \ndepend upon the affirmative grants of the Constitu-\ntion,\u201d and \u201cwould have vested in the federal govern-\nment as necessary concomitants of nationality\u201d even \u201cif \nthey had never been mentioned in the Constitution.\u201d  \nCurtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 318.  Our Nation\u2019s external \n\n43 \n \nrelations with other sovereigns are thus governed not \nby \u201cthe Constitution nor the laws passed in pursuance \nof it\u201d but \u201cby treaties, international understandings \nand compacts, and the principles of international law.\u201d  \nIbid. \nIt is thus unsurprising that this Court has regu-\nlarly described the federal government\u2019s power \u201cwith \nrespect to foreign relations and international com-\nmerce\u201d as \u201cplenary.\u201d  See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, \n225 (1982); Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 320 (referring \nto \u201cthe very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the \nPresident as the sole organ of the federal government \nin the field of international relations\u201d).  Antrix\u2019s consti-\ntutional argument disparages that plenary authority, \ninsisting that the federal government is powerless to \nset the terms on which foreign states and their agen-\ncies and instrumentalities may be haled into its courts.  \nThere is no constitutional basis for such limitation. \n2.  The nature of the relationship of the United \nStates to foreign states in the international community \njustifies the primary and plenary power the political \nbranches exercise in foreign relations.  \u201cForeign states \nexist with the United States as coequal sovereigns on \nthe international plane,\u201d each of which \u201cis left free to \ndetermine its own internal political organization \nthrough whatever constitutional or other vehicles are \nappropriate to its own circumstances.\u201d  Lori Fisler \nDamrosch, Foreign States and the Constitution, 73 Va. \nL. Rev. 483, 519-520 (1987).  Based on \u201cthese basic in-\nternational law concepts, foreign states lack any legal \ninterest in whether another state has a constitution, \nwhat it says, or whether constitutional provisions are \napplied according to their terms.  The most a foreign \nstate can demand is that other states observe interna-\n\n44 \n \ntional law, not that they enforce provisions of domestic \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 520.   \nBecause foreign states are outsiders to our consti-\ntutional system who have not agreed to abide by our \nConstitution and internal law\u2014just as the United \nStates has not agreed to abide by their internal law\u2014\n\u201c[r]elations between nations in the international com-\nmunity are seldom governed by the domestic law of one \nstate or the other.\u201d  Price, 294 F.3d at 97.  \u201cAnd legal \ndisputes between the United States and foreign gov-\nernments are not mediated through the Constitution.\u201d  \nIbid.  Instead, \u201cthe federal judiciary has relied on prin-\nciples of comity and international law to protect foreign \ngovernments in the American legal system,\u201d an \u201cap-\nproach [that] recognizes the reality that foreign na-\ntions are external to the constitutional compact\u201d and \n\u201cpreserves the flexibility and discretion of the political \nbranches in conducting the country\u2019s relations with \nother nations.\u201d  Ibid.  \nBased on the structural relationship of the United \nStates and its Constitution to external foreign states, \nthe \u201crelevant inquiry\u201d is \u201cwhether courts should inter-\nvene in the structure of foreign policy decisionmaking \nat the instance of parties whose relation to that struc-\nture is one not just of an outsider but of a sovereign \nequal.\u201d  Damrosch, supra, 73 Va. L. Rev. at 527.   \nIt makes little sense to consider whether a foreign \nstate\u2019s due-process rights have been violated because \n\u201c[t]he personal jurisdiction requirement recognizes and \nprotects an individual liberty interest,\u201d and \u201crepresents \na restriction on judicial power not as a matter of sover-\neignty, but as a matter of individual liberty.\u201d  Insurance \nCorp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxite de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982) (emphasis added); \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 98.   \n\n45 \n \nGiven the Due Process Clause\u2019s purpose in protect-\ning the liberty of those subject to our Constitution and \nlaws from unjust deprivation, it is \u201cquite clear\u201d that the \npersonal-jurisdiction requirement \u201csecures interests \nquite different from those at stake when a sovereign \nnation * * * seeks to defend itself against the preroga-\ntives of a rival government.\u201d  Price, 294 F.3d at 98.  The \nUnited States\u2019 sovereign juridical equals on the inter-\nnational plane \u201cstand on a fundamentally different \nfooting than do private litigants who are compelled to \ndefend themselves in American courts.\u201d  Ibid.   \nForeign states may avail themselves of a \u201cpanoply \nof mechanisms in the international arena\u201d to protect \ntheir interests.  Price, 294 F.3d at 98.  But it would \n\u201cbreak with the norms of international law and the \nstructure of domestic law\u201d to \u201cextend a constitutional \nrule meant to protect individual liberty\u201d to \u201cfrustrate \nthe Unites States government\u2019s clear statutory com-\nmand that [a foreign state] be subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the federal courts in the circumstances of this \ncase.\u201d  Id. at 98-99. \nBecause foreign states exist outside our constitu-\ntional order, the \u201cconstitutional limits that have been \nplaced on the exercise of personal jurisdiction do not \nlimit the prerogative of our nation to authorize legal \naction against another sovereign.\u201d  Price, 294 F.3d at \n99.  The United States exercised this prerogative when \nit enacted the FSIA.  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 493.  Con-\nferring upon a foreign state entirely alien to our consti-\ntutional order a \u201cdue process trump * * * against the \nauthority of the United States\u201d as expressed in the \nFSIA is \u201cnot only textually and structurally unsound, \nbut it would distort the very notion of \u2018liberty\u2019 that un-\nderlies the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Price, 294 F.3d at 99. \n\n46 \n \nIII. Requiring \nMinimum \nContacts \nWould \nDisrupt The Comprehensive FSIA System \nCrafted By The Political Branches. \nTo accept Antrix\u2019s argument, whether on statutory \nor constitutional grounds, would invert the respective \nroles of the three branches of the federal government \nwith respect to foreign affairs.  As this Court has long \nheld, \u201cthe very nature of executive decisions as to for-\neign policy is political, not judicial.\u201d  Chicago & South-\nern Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, \n111 (1948).  \u201cSuch decisions are wholly confided by our \nConstitution to the political departments of the govern-\nment, Executive and Legislative.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cThey are de-\ncisions of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither \naptitude, facilities nor responsibility and have long \nbeen held to belong in the domain of political power not \nsubject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.\u201d Ibid. \nIn short, \u201cforeign affairs\u201d is a \u201cdomain in which the \ncontrolling role of the political branches is both neces-\nsary and proper.\u201d  Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. \n212, 234, (2016).  \u201cIn a world that is ever more com-\npressed and interdependent, it is essential the congres-\nsional role in foreign affairs be understood and re-\nspected.\u201d  Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry 576 U.S. \n1, 21 (2015).  This Court has gone so far as to say that \n\u201cpolicies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations \n* * * are so exclusively entrusted to the political \nbranches of government so as to be largely immune \nfrom judicial inquiry or interference.\u201d  Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 589 (1952).   \nCongress has \u201cundisputed power to decide, as a \nmatter of federal law, whether and under what cir-\ncumstances foreign nations should be amenable to \nsuit in the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 493.  \nCongress, exercising its plenary authority in matters \n\n47 \n \nof foreign affairs, enacted the FSIA, a \u201cstatute com-\nprehensively regulating the amenability of foreign na-\ntions to suit in the United States.\u201d  Ibid. \nThus, the FSIA erects a \u201ccomprehensive set of le-\ngal standards governing claims of immunity in every \ncivil action against a foreign state.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 488.  \u201cThe key word there * * * is comprehen-\nsive,\u201d a term this Court has used \u201coften and advisedly \nto describe the Act\u2019s sweep.\u201d  Republic of Argentina v. \nNML Capital, Ltd., 573 U.S. 134, 141 (2014); see Re-\npublic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, 699 (2004) \n(\u201cCongress established [in the FSIA] a comprehensive \nframework for resolving any claim of sovereign im-\nmunity.\u201d).  Accordingly, \u201cany sort of immunity defense \nmade by a foreign sovereign in an American court \nmust stand on the Act\u2019s text.  Or it must fall.\u201d  NML \nCapital, 573 U.S. at 141-42. \nIn the FSIA, Congress determined that a judicial \nforum for seeking relief against foreign states is avail-\nable under certain enumerated circumstances.  These \ninclude if the foreign state has waived its immunity, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(1), if the action is based on certain \ncommercial activities of the foreign state, id. \n\u00a7\u20091605(a)(2), if the foreign state has expropriated cer-\ntain property in violation of international law, id. \n\u00a7\u20091605(a)(3), if a plaintiff is seeking to confirm an ar-\nbitral award against a foreign state, id. \u00a7\u20091605(a)(6), \nand if the foreign state is a state sponsor of terrorism \nresponsible for personal injury or death caused by an \nact of terrorism, id. \u00a7\u20091605A. \nIn each circumstance, Congress has decided that \n\u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist \nas to every claim for relief \u201d so long as the plaintiff \n\n48 \n \nserves the foreign state with process in accordance \nwith the procedure Congress has enacted.  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20091330(b) (emphasis added); see id. \u00a7\u20091608 (rules gov-\nerning service of process on a foreign state).  By apply-\ning a minimum-contacts standard with no basis in the \nFSIA\u2019s text, the Ninth Circuit usurped the role of the \npolitical branches.  It is for Congress and the President, \nnot courts, to devise conditions in which sovereign im-\nmunity falls away and a foreign state becomes subject \nto suit.   \nWorse still, the comprehensive system Congress \nset forth in the FSIA would be displaced in part by an \nInternational Shoe standard that leads to unpredicta-\nble and occasionally divergent outcomes.  And in mat-\nters, such as these, that \u201ctouch on foreign relations\u201d the \nUnited States must speak \u201cwith one voice.\u201d  Arizona v. \nUnited States, 567 U.S. 387, 409 (2012).  It is \u201cconcern \nfor uniformity in this country\u2019s dealings with foreign \nnations\u201d that \u201canimated the Constitution\u2019s allocation of \nthe foreign relations power to the National Govern-\nment in the first place.\u201d  American Insurance Ass\u2019n v. \nGaramendi, 539 U.S. 396, 413 (2003); The Federalist \nNo. 42, at 279 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cook ed., \n1961) (\u201cIf we are to be one nation in any respect, it \nclearly ought to be in respect to other nations.\u201d).  The \nNinth Circuit\u2019s rule \u201cviolates the separation of powers \nand anoints [courts] gatekeepers in a way not contem-\nplated by Congress or the Constitution.\u201d  Pet.App. \n47a. \nAs a practical matter, requiring minimum con-\ntacts would undermine the FSIA\u2019s carefully articu-\nlated exceptions to immunity.  It would mean that \ncourts \u201clock the courthouse doors to plaintiffs whom \nCongress expressly granted access,\u201d such as \u201cvictims \n\n49 \n \nof terrorism, those harmed by violations of interna-\ntional law, and persons who suffered from torture.\u201d  \nPet.App. 47a.   \nThe result would be \u201cserious practical problems.\u201d  \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 99.  As Judge Bumatay noted below, \nU.S. citizens would be required to demonstrate that a \nstate sponsor of terrorism such as Iran has sufficient \nminimum contacts with the United States in order to \n\u201cvindicate the death or injury of a loved one at the \nhands of a terrorist.\u201d  Pet.App. 68a.  Decisions of Con-\ngress and the President \u201cto freeze the assets of foreign \nnations, or to impose economic sanctions on them, \ncould be challenged as deprivations of property with-\nout due process of law,\u201d and \u201ccourts would be called \nupon to adjudicate these sensitive questions, which in \nturn could tie the hands of the other branches as they \nsought to respond to foreign policy crises.\u201d  Price, 294 \nF.3d at 99. \nProperly recognizing that foreign states or their \nagencies or instrumentalities cannot invoke the mini-\nmum-contacts rule, by contrast, would not have dis-\nruptive effects on the FSIA\u2019s system.  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s experience of more than two decades since the \nholding in Price\u2014and that of other circuits in the \nthree decades since Weltover\u2014demonstrate that for-\neign states do not need minimum-contacts protections \nto ensure fair adjudication in United States courts.  \n(Indeed, more than half a century of case law demon-\nstrates that States of the Union receive fair and ap-\npropriate justice despite their inability to invoke due \nprocess protections.) \nThe FSIA provides ample protections that are bet-\nter attuned to the delicate considerations of the for-\n\n50 \n \neign relations context than a minimum-contacts test.  \nMost important among these, of course, is the FSIA\u2019s \nbaseline guarantee of sovereign immunity, subject to \nnarrow and specific enumerated exceptions.  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u20091604, 1605, 1605A.  These are supported by \nother, equally specific, exceptions governing the cir-\ncumstances in which a foreign state\u2019s assets may be \navailable for execution in the United States.  Id. \n\u00a7\u00a7\u20091610, 1610A.   \nThe FSIA also protects foreign states with its par-\nticular service rules, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091608, and substan-\ntive protections governing liability and default, id. \n\u00a7\u20091606.  Foreign states and their agencies and instru-\nmentalities also enjoy particular standards governing \nvenue that channel FSIA actions into courts accus-\ntomed to handling the complexities of sovereign litiga-\ntion or where the foreign state has made itself pre-\nsent.  Id. \u00a7\u20091391.  With the established system of these \nrigorous and detailed protections, there is no cause for \ncourts to transplant the minimum-contacts standard \ninto the foreign sovereign context. \nThis Court should accordingly hold that neither \nthe FSIA nor the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment requires plaintiffs to demonstrate mini-\nmum contacts with the United States in cases where \nthe political branches have determined that a foreign \nstate or its agency or instrumentality is subject to suit \nin our courts. \n\n51 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nANNE CHAMPION \nGIBSON, DUNN & CRUTCHER LLP \n200 Park Avenue \nNew York, NY  10166 \n \nMALAIKA EATON \nMCNAUL EBEL NAWROT  \n& HELGREN PLLC \nOne Union Square \n600 University Street  \nSuite 2700 \nSeattle, WA  98101 \n \n \nMATTHEW D.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief was a state of no specific knowledge about the legal facts, precedents, or arguments in this case. This observation, while reflecting an internal thought process, has provided the foundational legal framework for my analysis.\n\nMy understanding has now evolved to identify the central legal question at the heart of this case: **Must a plaintiff prove that a foreign state has 'minimum contacts' with the forum for a U.S. court to assert personal jurisdiction, or does the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) provide a complete and sufficient framework for jurisdiction on its own?**\n\nThis clarifies the core conflict as a potential tension between a specific statutory scheme (FSIA) and a general constitutional requirement (the Due Process Clause's minimum contacts test, established in *International Shoe Co. v. Washington*). My prediction will ultimately depend on how the Court resolves this interplay.\n\nSpecifically, I now understand the following key elements of the case:\n*   **Petitioner's likely argument:** The FSIA itself, when its conditions are met, establishes both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, making a separate constitutional minimum contacts analysis unnecessary for suits against foreign sovereigns.\n*   **Respondent's likely argument:** The Due Process Clause is a constitutional floor, and statutory grants of jurisdiction like the FSIA cannot bypass the requirement to show minimum contacts before a defendant can be haled into court.\n*   **Key Legal Doctrines:** The case will turn on the interpretation of the FSIA's jurisdictional provisions (likely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b)), its relationship to the long-arm statute rule (Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)), and its interaction with the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\nWhile I have not yet analyzed any specific legal arguments or precedents from the briefs, I have moved from a state of no knowledge to a clear understanding of the legal battleground. My uncertainty is now focused on which interpretive methodology (textualism, originalism, purposivism) the Court will apply to the FSIA and how it will weigh precedents concerning personal jurisdiction over foreign states versus domestic corporations.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous understanding correctly identified the central legal question as the conflict between the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) and the constitutional \"minimum contacts\" test for personal jurisdiction. I had hypothesized that the petitioner's argument would center on the FSIA providing a complete jurisdictional framework that implicitly satisfies due process.\n\nThe observation of the petitioner's merits brief has substantially refined and deepened this understanding, moving from hypothesis to concrete legal strategy. My beliefs are now updated with the specific, multi-layered arguments CC/Devas will present to the Court.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **The Petitioner's argument is two-pronged, attacking both the statutory and constitutional basis for a minimum contacts requirement.** This is a more aggressive and fundamental challenge than I initially anticipated. The arguments are not just that the FSIA *satisfies* due process, but that the minimum contacts test is inapplicable on both statutory and constitutional grounds.\n\n2.  **Statutory Argument: The plain text of the FSIA is dispositive.**\n    *   **Core Text:** The petitioner's argument hinges on the mandatory language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b): \"Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state **shall exist** as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has been made under section 1608 of this title.\"\n    *   **Interpretation:** They argue this text establishes a simple, two-part test for personal jurisdiction: (1) subject-matter jurisdiction exists (i.e., an FSIA immunity exception like the arbitral exception applies), and (2) service of process is proper. The statute's plain language leaves no room for a third, judicially-engrafted requirement like minimum contacts.\n    *   **Key Precedents Cited:** They will likely use cases like *Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria* to emphasize the FSIA's role as a \"comprehensive\" jurisdictional scheme and *Republic of Sudan v. Harrison* to support a strict textualist reading of the FSIA's procedural requirements.\n\n3.  **Constitutional Argument: The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not protect foreign states with a minimum contacts requirement.** This is the most significant new piece of information, as it reframes the constitutional debate.\n    *   **Primary Claim: Foreign states are not \"persons.\"** The brief argues that foreign sovereigns are not \"persons\" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause. This argument draws an analogy to U.S. States, which are not considered \"persons\" for due process purposes.\n    *   **Key Precedent Cited:** They lean on a suggestion made by the Court in *Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.* (1992) and cite cases like *South Carolina v. Katzenbach* to support the principle that sovereigns are not \"persons\" under the Constitution.\n    *   **Alternative Claim: The FSIA itself provides all the \"process that is due.\"** Even if a foreign state *is* a \"person,\" the petitioner argues that the traditional *International Shoe* minimum contacts test is the wrong framework. Instead, the process due to a foreign sovereign is determined by the political branches (Congress and the President) acting in their exclusive domain of foreign relations. The comprehensive FSIA\u2014with its detailed immunity exceptions and service rules\u2014*is* that process. This argument frames the FSIA not as a statute that must be measured against a pre-existing judicial test, but as the political branches' authoritative definition of what process is appropriate for foreign sovereigns.\n\n4.  **Policy and Structural Arguments:**\n    *   **Disruption of a \"Comprehensive Scheme\":** The petitioner argues that imposing a minimum contacts analysis would undermine the FSIA's core purpose: to replace the chaotic, politically-driven \"Tate Letter\" system with a clear, uniform, and exclusive statutory framework.\n    *   **International Comity and Obligations:** They contend that requiring minimum contacts would violate U.S. obligations under international treaties, specifically the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, by creating an additional hurdle to enforcement not contemplated by the treaty.\n\nMy belief state has evolved from a general awareness of the legal conflict to a detailed understanding of the petitioner's specific lines of attack. My predictive model must now weigh how a textualist- and originalist-leaning Court will react to these specific arguments, particularly the foundational constitutional claim that foreign states lack \"personhood\" for due process purposes. My uncertainty is now focused on the strength and nature of the respondent's forthcoming counter-arguments.",

The primary source of uncertainty in my predictive model is the nature and strength of the respondent's counter-arguments. This action directly targets that uncertainty by seeking the respondent's merits brief.\n\nTask EIG is extremely high (0.95) because observing the respondent's brief is the single most critical action to balance my understanding of the case. It will reveal the direct rebuttals to the petitioner's statutory and constitutional claims, introduce new arguments, and clarify the core points of legal disagreement. This will cause a massive update to my posterior belief about the case outcome, moving it from a speculative, one-sided position to a much more robust, evidence-based prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5). While 'reading the other side's brief' is a fundamental and known-good strategy, executing it provides valuable data for refining my general model. Observing how a sophisticated party like Antrix counters a specific combination of textualist and novel constitutional arguments provides a concrete data point for my understanding of legal argumentation patterns. It reinforces the importance of this step and helps me better model the 'call and response' dynamic of Supreme Court litigation, improving my strategic approach in future, similar cases.\n\nConfidence is very high (0.95) because the value of obtaining the primary document from the opposing party in a legal dispute is self-evident and a cornerstone of any analytical process.

Ltd. \n\ni \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nAntrix, an Indian government-owned company, \nwas sued in U.S. district court under the arbitration \nexception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \n(FSIA) by another Indian company, Devas (Petitioner \nin No. 24-17). Devas sought to enforce an Indian \narbitration award\u2014later set aside by the competent \nIndian court\u2014that arose out of a dispute in India. \nShareholders and a subsidiary of Devas (Petitioners \nin No. 23-1201) intervened and convinced the district \ncourt not only to confirm the arbitral award, but to \nallow the Intervenors to register that judgment.  \nThe Ninth Circuit overturned those decisions. \nThe panel held that, for personal jurisdiction to lie, \nthe FSIA requires a claimant to show that the \ndefendant meets the minimum-contacts standard, \nand that no such showing was made here. Rehearing \nen banc was denied. The question presented is thus: \nDoes either the FSIA or constitutional due \nprocess require a minimum-contacts showing\u2014i.e., \nthat there is some connection between the parties, the \ndispute, and the United States\u2014for a U.S. court to \nexercise personal jurisdiction to enforce a foreign \narbitral award against a foreign sovereign entity?     \n \n \n\nii \n \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  \nAntrix Corp.

Rev. \n385, 396 n.64 (Jan. 1982).................................. 14 \n \n \n \n\n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nPetitioners ask this Court to review the \nunpublished decision of a Ninth Circuit panel holding, \nbased on forty years of FSIA precedent, that to enforce \nan arbitration award against a foreign sovereign in a \nU.S. court, the sovereign must have some relevant \nconnection to, or property in, the forum. The source of \nthat ruling is the settled understanding, reflected in \nprecedent from across the circuits, that in subjecting \nforeign sovereigns to jurisdiction under the FSIA \nexceptions to immunity, Congress understood those \nexceptions to embody the contacts with the United \nStates described in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).   \nPetitioners argue that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nstatutory analysis is wrong. They then invite the \nCourt to address a broader constitutional question: \nwhether foreign sovereigns are entitled to due process \nunder the Fifth Amendment. And Petitioners ask the \nCourt to take up these statutory and constitutional \nquestions in an unusual context: a case to enforce an \narbitral award that has been set aside by the court of \ncompetent jurisdiction, brought in a forum that has \nno connection to the parties\u2019 dispute. Petitioners also \nignore that the question they present\u2014whether \nforeign sovereigns are entitled to due process\u2014is \ndifficult to reach here because Respondent is a \ndistinct corporate entity, not the sovereign. The Court \nshould decline Petitioners\u2019 invitation.  \nAs shown below, the Ninth Circuit is no outlier in \nits application of minimum contacts analysis to FSIA \ncases. In fact, most circuits have long recognized that \nthe FSIA\u2019s exceptions to sovereign immunity\u2014at \nleast most of them, save one that is not at issue here \n\n2 \n \n(the terrorism exception)\u2014incorporate minimum \ncontacts requirements. This is evident from their text, \nand it is consistent with Congress\u2019s clear intent in \nenacting the FSIA. It is also fully consistent with both \nthe text and Congress\u2019s understanding of the \n\u201carbitration enforcement\u201d exception to the FSIA. An \naction to enforce an arbitration award against a \nforeign sovereign, just as against a private party, \nnecessarily contemplates that there be some property \nor presence in the forum where the action is brought. \nPetitioners\u2019 contrary position explicitly posits \nthat the FSIA\u2019s arbitration enforcement exception \nopened every federal courthouse to any plaintiff, from \nanywhere in the world, to drag a foreign sovereign \nthat lost an arbitration into U.S. court, and then \nsubject that sovereign to intrusive discovery\u2014even if \nthe sovereign has no presence or assets in the forum \nand the dispute has no connection to the forum. See \nInt.Pet.23 (\u201cParties seeking to confirm foreign \narbitral awards are often unaware whether their \njudgment debtor has assets in the United States and \nseek confirmation for the purpose of propounding \npost-judgment discovery requests[.]\u201d); Devas.Pet.19 \n(similar). Petitioners go even further here, urging \nthat, in a case that involves no contact with the \nUnited States and in which the United States has no \ninterest, U.S. courts may nonetheless review and \noverrule the final judgment of India\u2019s highest court \nthat an arbitration award was entered improperly. It \nis unlikely Congress would abandon basic principles \nof comity and open U.S. courts to suits against foreign \nsovereigns in this way. \n\n3 \n \nPetitioners try to support their assertion that the \nFSIA exceptions do not embrace due process \nstandards by invoking a recent exception not \napplicable here: the terrorism exception. They even \nsuggest that the decision below will frustrate \nattempts to hold terrorists responsible for harm to \nU.S. nationals and U.S. government employees. E.g., \nInt.Pet.22. But the exception allowing suits by U.S. \nnationals or government employees against state \nsponsors of terrorism, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a), is \ndifferent in text and intent from the other FSIA \nexceptions. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit decision on which \nPetitioners rely most heavily to argue that there is no \nright to a minimum contacts analysis in any FSIA \ncase, Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya, \ndiscussed \nthat \ndifference\u2014and \nreaffirmed that the other exceptions incorporate \nminimum contacts requirements. 294 F.3d 82, 89 \n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (\u201cUnder the original FSIA, . . . there \nhad to be some tangible connection between the \nconduct of the foreign defendant and the territory of \nthe United States.\u201d). While a few circuits have \nextended Price to other exceptions, they are a \nminority\u2014and at least one has indicated it is \nreconsidering that choice. \nPetitioners make much of that fact that two panel \njudges joined a brief concurrence opining that, \u201c[i]n an \nappropriate case, we should reconsider [the issue] en \nbanc.\u201d Int.Pet.App.11a. But all panel members then \nvoted (or recommended, in the case of District Judge \nMolloy, sitting by designation) against en banc \nreview, thus conveying that they did not view this \ncase as an appropriate vehicle to revisit the issue.  \n\n4 \n \nThe reasons for that are clear enough, and strongly \ncounsel against granting certiorari. \nFirst, there is no longer an award to enforce \nbecause the Delhi High Court\u2014the court of competent \njurisdiction to determine the award\u2019s enforceability\u2014\nset it aside, a decision affirmed by the Indian \nSupreme Court. Under principles of comity and \nlongstanding case law, the award no longer exists and \ncannot be enforced. Petitioners suggest that the Court \nshould ignore that development and let the Ninth \nCircuit deal with it on remand. But since there is no \naward to enforce, this case should be moot. At the very \nleast, it is not suitable for review.   \nSecond, Respondent is not a foreign state, but a \nstate-owned corporation. It is well established that \njuridical entities distinct from their sovereign are \npresumptively entitled to due process even when they \nare not entitled to sovereign immunity under the \nFSIA. Unless the entity was subject to extensive \ngovernment control and used for fraudulent purposes \n(of which there is no suggestion here), it retains its \nseparate identity. This threshold issue, which the \nNinth Circuit did not address, is logically antecedent \nto whether foreign sovereigns are entitled to due \nprocess under the FSIA or the Constitution.  \nIn short, the question Petitioners raise\u2014which is \nreally two questions, one statutory and one \nconstitutional\u2014arises infrequently and is not cleanly \npresented here. And the panel decision is no outlier, \nbut aligns with precedent from across the circuits, as \nwell as Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the FSIA. The \npetitions for certiorari should be denied.  \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. \nLegal Background. \nBefore Congress enacted the FSIA, lawsuits \nbrought against foreign sovereigns operated under \nthe \u201cprinciple [ ] that courts may not so exercise their \njurisdiction \u2026 as to embarrass the executive arm of \nthe government in conducting foreign relations.\u201d Ex \nparte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 588 (1943). \nThere followed a \u201cpolicy, recognized both by the \nDepartment of State and the courts, that our national \ninterest will be better served in such cases if the \nwrongs to suitors, involving our relations with a \nfriendly \nforeign \npower, \nare \nrighted \nthrough \ndiplomatic \nnegotiations \nrather \nthan \nby \nthe \ncompulsions of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. at 589. This \nmeant sovereign immunity determinations were often \nmade by two different branches under governing \nstandards that were neither clear nor uniformly \napplied. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, \n691 (2004). \u201cIn 1976 Congress sought to remedy these \nproblems by enacting the FSIA.\u201d Id. \nThe FSIA \u201ccodifies . . . the restrictive theory of \nsovereign immunity. A foreign state is normally \nimmune from the jurisdiction of federal and state \ncourts \u2026 subject to a set of exceptions specified\u201d in the \nFSIA. Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 \nU.S. 480, 488 (1983). Subject to those exceptions, the \nFSIA \n\u201cprovides \nthe \nsole \nbasis \nfor \nobtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this \ncountry.\u201d Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 355 \n(1993) (quoting Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess \nShipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 443 (1989)). At present, \n\n6 \n \nthe \nFSIA\u2019s \nexceptions \ncover: \n(1) \nwaiver; \n(2) \ncommercial \nactivity; \n(3) \nexpropriation; \n(4) \nnoncommercial torts in the United States; (5) \nenforcement of arbitral awards; and (6) state-\nsponsored terrorism. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605, 1605A. \nOnly the exception for enforcement of arbitral awards \nis at issue here.  \nWhen enacted in 1976, it was understood that the \nFSIA would be applied to suits to enforce arbitration \nagreements or confirm arbitral awards against \nforeign states through the waiver exception of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1). But waiver was found only \u201cin \ncases where a foreign state has agreed to arbitration \nin another country or where a foreign state has agreed \nthat the law of a particular country should govern a \ncontract.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976), \nreprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6617; see \nIpitrade Int\u2019l, S. A. v. Fed. Republic of Nigeria, 465 F. \nSupp. 824, 826 (D.D.C. 1978).  \nA decade later, in 1988, the arbitration exception \nwas enacted to allow suits against a foreign state to \nenforce an arbitration agreement between the foreign \nstate and a private party\u2014or to confirm an arbitral \naward pursuant to such an agreement. Pub. L. No. \n100-669, 102 Stat. 3969 (1988) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6)). The amendment codified implied waiver \nas one of the grounds for application of the arbitration \nexception. Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(D). And it added further \ngrounds, including to allow suit where the agreement \nor award is \u201cgoverned by a treaty or other \ninternational agreement in force for the United States \ncalling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral \nawards[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B).  \n\n7 \n \nThe terrorism exception, enacted twenty years \nafter the original FSIA,1 is a different story. That \nexception provides that a \u201cdesignated state sponsor of \nterrorism\u201d has no immunity from a suit for money \ndamages for personal injury or death caused by \u201can \nact of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, \nhostage taking, or the provision of material support \nor resources for such an act if such act \u2026 is engaged \nin by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign \nstate[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1). The terrorism \nexception was amended substantially in 2008, \nincluding to remove it from the list of immunity \nexceptions set forth in section 1605(a), and to create a \nnew statutory provision outlining the particular \nrequirements of that unique exception.2  \nThe terrorism exception is an outlier to the \nterritoriality originally required, and still otherwise \nrequired, for FSIA jurisdiction. Under that exception, \n\u201cthe only required link between the defendant nation \nand the territory of the United States is the \nnationality of the claimant.\u201d Price, 294 F.3d at 90. It \nthus \u201callows personal jurisdiction to be maintained ... \nin circumstances that do not appear to satisfy the \n\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 requirement of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d Id. But nothing in the text of the terrorism \nexception suggests any change to the scope of earlier \nFSIA exceptions. \n                                            \n1 See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1241 (1996) (formerly \ncodified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(7)). \n2 See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. \nNo. 110-181, 122 Stat. 3, 338\u201344 (2008). \n\n8 \n \nB. \nFactual Background. \nThis case arises from a contract between two \nIndian companies that contracted in India for \nperformance \nin \nIndia, \nthen \narbitrated \ntheir \ncontractual dispute before a tribunal seated in India, \nresulting in an award that has since been set aside by \nthe Indian court of competent jurisdiction. \nAntrix is a private Indian company owned by the \nGovernment of India. ER-246.3 Antrix has provided \nspace-related services since its incorporation in 1992, \nbut Antrix is not an agent of the Indian Department \nof Space or the Indian Space Research Organization \n(\u201cISRO\u201d). DevasSER-53; ER-110. Antrix acts with a \nseparate \nlegal \npersonality \nfrom \nthe \nIndian \ngovernment, and it operates under the Indian \nCompanies Act like any other private company. See \nid. Antrix has never had agents, offices, or operations \nin the United States.  \nDevas Multimedia Private Ltd. (\u201cDevas\u201d), a \nprivate Indian company,4 was founded in 2004.

Dkt.\u201d are references \nto the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nWashington\u2019s 2:18-cv-1360 docket. \n4 Devas misleadingly states that it was founded by American \ninvestors and executives to provide telecommunications service \nin India. Devas.Pet.4. But Devas was founded by Indian \nshareholders, including one ex-ISRO official, to provide satellite-\nbased multimedia services. See ER-79 \n\n9 \n \n46; ECF 72 at 4\u20135. Devas was later found liable in \nIndia for fraud in its incorporation and management. \n3-ER-335\u2013349; ECF 72 at 234\u2013245. \nThe parties\u2019 dispute arose out of a satellite leasing \nAgreement executed in India in 2005, governed \npurely by Indian law and calling for performance in \nIndia, which Antrix terminated when India\u2019s Cabinet \nCommittee on Security blocked performance. ER-50\u2013\n52; ER-88. Over Antrix\u2019s objections and without any \narbitrators selected by Antrix, Devas commenced an \nICC-administered arbitration. ER-60\u201361; ER-89; ER-\n251\u2013252. The arbitration was seated in New Delhi \nand applied Indian law. ER-64; ER-89\u201390; ER-251-52.  \nIn September 2015, the Tribunal issued an award \nfor Devas (the \u201cAward\u201d). ER-150. That same year, \nAntrix appealed by applying to set aside the Award in \nan Indian court. Petitioner Devas, however, initiated \nproceedings to secure the Award in a different Indian \ncourt\u2014the Delhi High Court.

Ltd. \n\ni \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nAntrix, an Indian government-owned company, \nwas sued in U.S. district court under the arbitration \nexception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \n(FSIA) by another Indian company, Devas (Petitioner \nin No. 24-17). Devas sought to enforce an Indian \narbitration award\u2014later set aside by the competent \nIndian court\u2014that arose out of a dispute in India. \nShareholders and a subsidiary of Devas (Petitioners \nin No. 23-1201) intervened and convinced the district \ncourt not only to confirm the arbitral award, but to \nallow the Intervenors to register that judgment.  \nThe Ninth Circuit overturned those decisions. \nThe panel held that, for personal jurisdiction to lie, \nthe FSIA requires a claimant to show that the \ndefendant meets the minimum-contacts standard, \nand that no such showing was made here. Rehearing \nen banc was denied. The question presented is thus: \nDoes either the FSIA or constitutional due \nprocess require a minimum-contacts showing\u2014i.e., \nthat there is some connection between the parties, the \ndispute, and the United States\u2014for a U.S. court to \nexercise personal jurisdiction to enforce a foreign \narbitral award against a foreign sovereign entity?     \n \n \n\nii \n \nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  \nAntrix Corp. Ltd does not have a parent \ncorporation. \nAntrix \nis \nwholly \nowned \nby \nthe \nGovernment of India.

Rev. \n385, 396 n.64 (Jan. 1982).................................. 14 \n \n \n \n\n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nPetitioners ask this Court to review the \nunpublished decision of a Ninth Circuit panel holding, \nbased on forty years of FSIA precedent, that to enforce \nan arbitration award against a foreign sovereign in a \nU.S. court, the sovereign must have some relevant \nconnection to, or property in, the forum. The source of \nthat ruling is the settled understanding, reflected in \nprecedent from across the circuits, that in subjecting \nforeign sovereigns to jurisdiction under the FSIA \nexceptions to immunity, Congress understood those \nexceptions to embody the contacts with the United \nStates described in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).   \nPetitioners argue that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nstatutory analysis is wrong. They then invite the \nCourt to address a broader constitutional question: \nwhether foreign sovereigns are entitled to due process \nunder the Fifth Amendment. And Petitioners ask the \nCourt to take up these statutory and constitutional \nquestions in an unusual context: a case to enforce an \narbitral award that has been set aside by the court of \ncompetent jurisdiction, brought in a forum that has \nno connection to the parties\u2019 dispute. Petitioners also \nignore that the question they present\u2014whether \nforeign sovereigns are entitled to due process\u2014is \ndifficult to reach here because Respondent is a \ndistinct corporate entity, not the sovereign. The Court \nshould decline Petitioners\u2019 invitation.  \nAs shown below, the Ninth Circuit is no outlier in \nits application of minimum contacts analysis to FSIA \ncases. In fact, most circuits have long recognized that \nthe FSIA\u2019s exceptions to sovereign immunity\u2014at \nleast most of them, save one that is not at issue here \n\n2 \n \n(the terrorism exception)\u2014incorporate minimum \ncontacts requirements. This is evident from their text, \nand it is consistent with Congress\u2019s clear intent in \nenacting the FSIA. It is also fully consistent with both \nthe text and Congress\u2019s understanding of the \n\u201carbitration enforcement\u201d exception to the FSIA. An \naction to enforce an arbitration award against a \nforeign sovereign, just as against a private party, \nnecessarily contemplates that there be some property \nor presence in the forum where the action is brought. \nPetitioners\u2019 contrary position explicitly posits \nthat the FSIA\u2019s arbitration enforcement exception \nopened every federal courthouse to any plaintiff, from \nanywhere in the world, to drag a foreign sovereign \nthat lost an arbitration into U.S. court, and then \nsubject that sovereign to intrusive discovery\u2014even if \nthe sovereign has no presence or assets in the forum \nand the dispute has no connection to the forum. See \nInt.Pet.23 (\u201cParties seeking to confirm foreign \narbitral awards are often unaware whether their \njudgment debtor has assets in the United States and \nseek confirmation for the purpose of propounding \npost-judgment discovery requests[.]\u201d); Devas.Pet.19 \n(similar). Petitioners go even further here, urging \nthat, in a case that involves no contact with the \nUnited States and in which the United States has no \ninterest, U.S. courts may nonetheless review and \noverrule the final judgment of India\u2019s highest court \nthat an arbitration award was entered improperly. It \nis unlikely Congress would abandon basic principles \nof comity and open U.S. courts to suits against foreign \nsovereigns in this way. \n\n3 \n \nPetitioners try to support their assertion that the \nFSIA exceptions do not embrace due process \nstandards by invoking a recent exception not \napplicable here: the terrorism exception. They even \nsuggest that the decision below will frustrate \nattempts to hold terrorists responsible for harm to \nU.S. nationals and U.S. government employees. E.g., \nInt.Pet.22. But the exception allowing suits by U.S. \nnationals or government employees against state \nsponsors of terrorism, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a), is \ndifferent in text and intent from the other FSIA \nexceptions. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit decision on which \nPetitioners rely most heavily to argue that there is no \nright to a minimum contacts analysis in any FSIA \ncase, Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya, \ndiscussed \nthat \ndifference\u2014and \nreaffirmed that the other exceptions incorporate \nminimum contacts requirements. 294 F.3d 82, 89 \n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (\u201cUnder the original FSIA, . . . there \nhad to be some tangible connection between the \nconduct of the foreign defendant and the territory of \nthe United States.\u201d). While a few circuits have \nextended Price to other exceptions, they are a \nminority\u2014and at least one has indicated it is \nreconsidering that choice. \nPetitioners make much of that fact that two panel \njudges joined a brief concurrence opining that, \u201c[i]n an \nappropriate case, we should reconsider [the issue] en \nbanc.\u201d Int.Pet.App.11a. But all panel members then \nvoted (or recommended, in the case of District Judge \nMolloy, sitting by designation) against en banc \nreview, thus conveying that they did not view this \ncase as an appropriate vehicle to revisit the issue.  \n\n4 \n \nThe reasons for that are clear enough, and strongly \ncounsel against granting certiorari. \nFirst, there is no longer an award to enforce \nbecause the Delhi High Court\u2014the court of competent \njurisdiction to determine the award\u2019s enforceability\u2014\nset it aside, a decision affirmed by the Indian \nSupreme Court. Under principles of comity and \nlongstanding case law, the award no longer exists and \ncannot be enforced. Petitioners suggest that the Court \nshould ignore that development and let the Ninth \nCircuit deal with it on remand. But since there is no \naward to enforce, this case should be moot. At the very \nleast, it is not suitable for review.   \nSecond, Respondent is not a foreign state, but a \nstate-owned corporation. It is well established that \njuridical entities distinct from their sovereign are \npresumptively entitled to due process even when they \nare not entitled to sovereign immunity under the \nFSIA. Unless the entity was subject to extensive \ngovernment control and used for fraudulent purposes \n(of which there is no suggestion here), it retains its \nseparate identity. This threshold issue, which the \nNinth Circuit did not address, is logically antecedent \nto whether foreign sovereigns are entitled to due \nprocess under the FSIA or the Constitution.  \nIn short, the question Petitioners raise\u2014which is \nreally two questions, one statutory and one \nconstitutional\u2014arises infrequently and is not cleanly \npresented here. And the panel decision is no outlier, \nbut aligns with precedent from across the circuits, as \nwell as Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the FSIA. The \npetitions for certiorari should be denied.  \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. \nLegal Background. \nBefore Congress enacted the FSIA, lawsuits \nbrought against foreign sovereigns operated under \nthe \u201cprinciple [ ] that courts may not so exercise their \njurisdiction \u2026 as to embarrass the executive arm of \nthe government in conducting foreign relations.\u201d Ex \nparte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 588 (1943). \nThere followed a \u201cpolicy, recognized both by the \nDepartment of State and the courts, that our national \ninterest will be better served in such cases if the \nwrongs to suitors, involving our relations with a \nfriendly \nforeign \npower, \nare \nrighted \nthrough \ndiplomatic \nnegotiations \nrather \nthan \nby \nthe \ncompulsions of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. at 589. This \nmeant sovereign immunity determinations were often \nmade by two different branches under governing \nstandards that were neither clear nor uniformly \napplied. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, \n691 (2004). \u201cIn 1976 Congress sought to remedy these \nproblems by enacting the FSIA.\u201d Id. \nThe FSIA \u201ccodifies . . . the restrictive theory of \nsovereign immunity. A foreign state is normally \nimmune from the jurisdiction of federal and state \ncourts \u2026 subject to a set of exceptions specified\u201d in the \nFSIA. Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 \nU.S. 480, 488 (1983). Subject to those exceptions, the \nFSIA \n\u201cprovides \nthe \nsole \nbasis \nfor \nobtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this \ncountry.\u201d Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 355 \n(1993) (quoting Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess \nShipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 443 (1989)). At present, \n\n6 \n \nthe \nFSIA\u2019s \nexceptions \ncover: \n(1) \nwaiver; \n(2) \ncommercial \nactivity; \n(3) \nexpropriation; \n(4) \nnoncommercial torts in the United States; (5) \nenforcement of arbitral awards; and (6) state-\nsponsored terrorism. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605, 1605A. \nOnly the exception for enforcement of arbitral awards \nis at issue here.  \nWhen enacted in 1976, it was understood that the \nFSIA would be applied to suits to enforce arbitration \nagreements or confirm arbitral awards against \nforeign states through the waiver exception of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1). But waiver was found only \u201cin \ncases where a foreign state has agreed to arbitration \nin another country or where a foreign state has agreed \nthat the law of a particular country should govern a \ncontract.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976), \nreprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6617; see \nIpitrade Int\u2019l, S. A. v. Fed. Republic of Nigeria, 465 F. \nSupp. 824, 826 (D.D.C. 1978).  \nA decade later, in 1988, the arbitration exception \nwas enacted to allow suits against a foreign state to \nenforce an arbitration agreement between the foreign \nstate and a private party\u2014or to confirm an arbitral \naward pursuant to such an agreement. Pub. L. No. \n100-669, 102 Stat. 3969 (1988) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6)). The amendment codified implied waiver \nas one of the grounds for application of the arbitration \nexception. Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(D). And it added further \ngrounds, including to allow suit where the agreement \nor award is \u201cgoverned by a treaty or other \ninternational agreement in force for the United States \ncalling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral \nawards[.]\u201d Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B).  \n\n7 \n \nThe terrorism exception, enacted twenty years \nafter the original FSIA,1 is a different story. That \nexception provides that a \u201cdesignated state sponsor of \nterrorism\u201d has no immunity from a suit for money \ndamages for personal injury or death caused by \u201can \nact of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, \nhostage taking, or the provision of material support \nor resources for such an act if such act \u2026 is engaged \nin by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign \nstate[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1). The terrorism \nexception was amended substantially in 2008, \nincluding to remove it from the list of immunity \nexceptions set forth in section 1605(a), and to create a \nnew statutory provision outlining the particular \nrequirements of that unique exception.2  \nThe terrorism exception is an outlier to the \nterritoriality originally required, and still otherwise \nrequired, for FSIA jurisdiction. Under that exception, \n\u201cthe only required link between the defendant nation \nand the territory of the United States is the \nnationality of the claimant.\u201d Price, 294 F.3d at 90. It \nthus \u201callows personal jurisdiction to be maintained ... \nin circumstances that do not appear to satisfy the \n\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 requirement of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d Id. But nothing in the text of the terrorism \nexception suggests any change to the scope of earlier \nFSIA exceptions. \n                                            \n1 See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \nPub.

ER-246.3 Antrix has provided \nspace-related services since its incorporation in 1992, \nbut Antrix is not an agent of the Indian Department \nof Space or the Indian Space Research Organization \n(\u201cISRO\u201d). DevasSER-53; ER-110. Antrix acts with a \nseparate \nlegal \npersonality \nfrom \nthe \nIndian \ngovernment, and it operates under the Indian \nCompanies Act like any other private company. See \nid. Antrix has never had agents, offices, or operations \nin the United States.  \nDevas Multimedia Private Ltd. (\u201cDevas\u201d), a \nprivate Indian company,4 was founded in 2004.

Devas.Pet.4. But Devas was founded by Indian \nshareholders, including one ex-ISRO official, to provide satellite-\nbased multimedia services. See ER-79 \n\n9 \n \n46; ECF 72 at 4\u20135. Devas was later found liable in \nIndia for fraud in its incorporation and management. \n3-ER-335\u2013349; ECF 72 at 234\u2013245. \nThe parties\u2019 dispute arose out of a satellite leasing \nAgreement executed in India in 2005, governed \npurely by Indian law and calling for performance in \nIndia, which Antrix terminated when India\u2019s Cabinet \nCommittee on Security blocked performance. ER-50\u2013\n52; ER-88. Over Antrix\u2019s objections and without any \narbitrators selected by Antrix, Devas commenced an \nICC-administered arbitration. ER-60\u201361; ER-89; ER-\n251\u2013252. The arbitration was seated in New Delhi \nand applied Indian law. ER-64; ER-89\u201390; ER-251-52.  \nIn September 2015, the Tribunal issued an award \nfor Devas (the \u201cAward\u201d). ER-150. That same year, \nAntrix appealed by applying to set aside the Award in \nan Indian court. Petitioner Devas, however, initiated \nproceedings to secure the Award in a different Indian \ncourt\u2014the Delhi High Court. The Indian Supreme \nCourt determined that the Delhi High Court was the \ncompetent court to decide the issue. 3-ER-350\u2013354.  \nWhile the set-aside proceedings were ongoing, a \nspecialized corporate law court in Bengaluru found \nDevas liable for fraud in its incorporation and \nmanagement and appointed a liquidator. 3-ER-335\u2013\n349. The Indian Supreme Court upheld that decision. \nECF 72 at 234\u2013245. \nOn August 29, 2022, the Delhi High Court set \naside the Award. The court concluded that the \nTribunal had erred in key respects, including by \nignoring the pre-contractual documents and issuing \n\n10 \n \ncontradictory rulings, and that the Award was \ncontrary to public policy in light of the Indian \nSupreme Court\u2019s findings of fraud in Devas\u2019s \nformation and management. See ECF 72. An \nappellate panel of the Delhi High Court affirmed that \nset-aside. ECF 85. The Indian Supreme Court \ndismissed Devas\u2019s last appeal, ECF 116 (Attach. A), \nand so the set-aside decision is final. \nC. \nProcedural Background. \nIn 2018, with Antrix\u2019s set-aside application still \npending, Devas filed suit to confirm the Award in the \nWestern District of Washington. ER-45\u201348. Devas \nassured the district court that, \u201c[i]f the ultimate \nresult in India is that the award is affirmed, then no \nprejudice whatsoever is had. If the ultimate decision \nin India is that the award is somehow rescinded, then \nmoney is returned.\u201d D.C. Dkt. 50, Hr\u2019g Tr. 16:14\u201317 \n(Oct. 24, 2020).  \nOver Antrix\u2019s opposition, and with Indian court \nproceedings pending, the district court confirmed the \nAward in November 2020 and entered judgment for \nDevas. Int.Pet.App.34a. The district court then \nallowed Intervenors (Mauritian shareholders5 of \nDevas and one U.S. subsidiary) to conduct post-\n                                            \n5 These companies have been under the control of a liquidator \nappointed by the Mauritius Supreme Court, which entered an \norder in 2023 prohibiting shareholders and \u201c[any] agent acting \non their behalf\u201d from representing these companies \u201cin any legal \nor arbitral proceedings, including\u201d to \u201ccontinu[e] . . . proceedings \nbefore any forum, institution, or jurisdiction, whether local or \nabroad.\u201d ECF 116, Attach. B at 10-11. Intervenor-Petitioners\u2019 \npursuit of certiorari violates that order. \n\n11 \n \njudgment discovery. 2-ER-287; 2-ER-166\u2013167; 1-ER-\n28. Over Devas\u2019s opposition, the district court \ncertified the judgment for Intervenors to register in \nthe Eastern District of Virginia and garnish $146,457 \nowed to Antrix there. Devas.Pet.App.40a. Intervenors \ndid so and collected funds. Antrix appealed both the \nentry and registry of the judgment. Devas also \nappealed the decision allowing Intervenors to register \nthe judgment.  \nIn September 2022, shortly after the Delhi High \nCourt set aside the Award, Antrix moved for a limited \nremand back to the district court to ask the district \ncourt to vacate its judgment confirming an award that \nhad since been set aside by the Indian courts.   ECF \n72. The Ninth Circuit instead scheduled argument, \nasking the parties to address the remand motion \ntherein. ECF 78, 84.  \nIn an unpublished decision, a Ninth Circuit panel \nreversed the district court\u2019s judgment, holding that \nunder \nlongstanding \nNinth \nCircuit \nprecedent, \nminimum contacts requirements must be met for a \nforeign sovereign to be sued in the United States \nunder the FSIA. Int.Pet.App.5a-6a.  \nThe Ninth Circuit further held that \u201cthe district \ncourt erred in holding that Antrix had the requisite \nminimum contacts for personal jurisdiction\u201d because \nthe dispute bore no connection to the United States: \nthe Agreement \u201cwas negotiated outside of the United \nStates, executed in India in 2005, and did not require \nAntrix to conduct any activities or create ongoing \nobligations in the United States.\u201d Int.Pet.App.7a. \nNotably, Petitioners do not ask this Court to revisit \n\n12 \n \nthe panel\u2019s holding that Antrix lacks minimum \ncontacts with the United States; they only challenge \nwhether minimum contacts analysis is required at all.  \nBecause the panel reversed the judgment below \non other grounds, it denied Antrix\u2019s motion for a \nlimited remand as moot. Int.Pet.App.8a n.1. The \npanel also did not reach the question of Intervenors\u2019 \nauthority to enforce the Award. \nIn a concurring opinion, two panel members \nopined that the Ninth Circuit should, in \u201can \nappropriate case,\u201d reconsider its precedent requiring \na minimum-contacts showing for foreign states.  \nInt.Pet.App.11a. They did not say this is the \nappropriate case. Indeed, all panel members voted to \ndeny en banc review. Int.Pet.App.45a. Only six of the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s twenty-nine active judges voted for en \nbanc \nrehearing, \nwhich \nwas \ntherefore \ndenied. \nInt.Pet.App.45a-46a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITIONS \nI. \nThe decision below is sound and consistent \nwith the FSIA\u2019s history and text.  \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s unreported panel decision \nreversing the judgment against Antrix because \nAntrix lacks minimum contacts with the United \nStates is fundamentally sound. It aligns with the \nhistory, text, and Congressional intent behind the \nFSIA and its exceptions to sovereign immunity, \nincluding the arbitration exception.  \n\n13 \n \nA. \nThe panel\u2019s decision aligns with the \nFSIA\u2019s history. \nThe panel\u2019s holding that a foreign sovereign \nentity must have minimum contacts with the United \nStates before it can be sued under the FSIA\u2019s \narbitration exception is well grounded in the history \nof and Congressional intent behind the FSIA. \nBefore Congress enacted the FSIA, lawsuits \nbrought against foreign sovereigns were subject to the \n\u201cprinciple [] that courts may not so exercise their \njurisdiction ... as to embarrass the executive arm of \nthe government in conducting foreign relations.\u201d \nEx parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. at 588. This \nreflected a \u201cpolicy, recognized both by the Department \nof State and the courts, that our national interest will \nbe better served in such cases if the wrongs to suitors, \ninvolving our relations with a friendly foreign power, \nare righted through diplomatic negotiations rather \nthan by the compulsions of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. \nat 589. \nIn 1952 the State Department issued the \u201cTate \nLetter,\u201d \nwhich \nintroduced \na \nnewly-narrowed \nframework for immunity in which \u201cthe immunity of \nthe sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign \nor public acts (jure imperii) of a state, but not with \nrespect to private acts (jure gestionis).\u201d6 Congress \nenacted the FSIA in 1976 to codify this distinction, \ndescribing the Act as \u201ca Federal long-arm statute over \nforeign states[.]\u201d H. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 13. And, in \n                                            \n6 Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nState, to Acting U.S. Attorney General Philip B. Perlman (May \n19, 1952). \n\n14 \n \nenacting the text, Congress plainly proceeded on the \nunderstanding that:  \nThe \nrequirements \nof \nminimum \njurisdictional contacts and adequate \nnotice are embodied in the provision.  \nId.  \nThat understanding was consistent with practice \nat the time. As this Court has explained, when the \nFSIA was enacted, the exercise of jurisdiction over a \nforeign sovereign \u201cgenerally requires some form of \ncontact with the United States.\u201d See Verlinden B.V., \n461 U.S. at 490 n.15. \u201cSignificantly, each of the \nimmunity provisions in the bill, sections 1605-1607, \nrequires some connection between the lawsuit and the \nUnited States\u201d and thus \u201cprescribe the necessary \ncontacts which must exist before our courts can \nexercise \npersonal \njurisdiction.\u201d \nMary \nKay \nKane, Suing \nForeign \nSovereigns: \nA \nProcedural \nCompass, 34 Stan. L. Rev. 385, 396 n.64 (Jan. 1982) \n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1487, at 13). \nCongress was quite clear about its intent to bake \nthe minimum contacts standard into the FSIA\u2019s \nexceptions to immunity. In the years leading to \nenactment, \nCongress \ncontemplated \nthat \n\u201cthe \njurisdictional standard [would be] the same for the \nactivities of a foreign state as for the activities of a \nforeign private enterprise.\u201d Immunities of Foreign \nStates: Hearing on H.R. 3493 before the Subcomm. on \nClaims and Governmental Relations of the H Comm. \non the Judiciary, 93d Cong., 41 (1973). As scholars \nhave explained, \u201cthe general assumption was that \nforeign sovereigns enjoyed the same constitutional \nprotections as other defendants.\u201d  Ingrid Wuerth, The \n\n15 \n \nDue Process and Other Constitutional Rights of \nForeign Nations, 88 Fordham L. Rev. 633, 646 \n(Nov. 2019). \nShortly before enactment, one FSIA drafter\u2014and \nthe Chief of the Foreign Litigation Section of the \nDepartment of Justice\u2019s Civil Division\u2014testified:  \nAbsent the requisite contacts, no suit can be \nmaintained since the existence of the \ncontacts with the forum is essentially to \nsatisfy the constitutional requirement of due \nprocess. \u2026 [T]he long-arm feature of the bill \nwill insure that only those disputes which \nhave a relation to the United States are \nlitigated in the courts of the United States[.]7  \nOnce the FSIA was enacted, circuit courts \nconsistently \nrecognized \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nincorporate a minimum contacts requirement. E.g., \nCarey v. Nat\u2019l Oil Corp., 592 F.2d 673, 676 (2d Cir. \n1979) (\u201cThe legislative history of this section makes \nclear that it embodies the standard set out in \nInternational Shoe . . . that in order to satisfy due \nprocess requirements, a defendant . . . must have \n\u2018certain minimum contacts with [the forum] such that \nthe maintenance of the suit does not offend \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantive \njustice.\u2019\u2019\u201d); see also Gregorian v. Izvestia, 871 F.2d \n1515, 1529 (9th Cir. 1989) (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction \nunder the FSIA requires satisfaction of the traditional \n                                            \n7 Jurisdiction of U.S. Courts in Suits Against Foreign States: \nHearings on H.R. 11315 Before Subcomm. on Admin.

Consejo Nacional De Produccion De \nCosta Rica, 614 F.2d 1247, 1255 n.5 (9th Cir. 1980) \n(\u201cThe \nrequirements \nof \nminimum \njurisdictional \ncontacts and adequate notice are embodied in the \nprovision.\u201d)).  \nDecades after enactment of the FSIA, scholars \ncontinued to note Congress\u2019s intent to \u201ctreat foreign \nstate defendants similar[ly] to other \u2018persons\u2019 who are \nentitled to due process protection\u201d for personal \njurisdiction purposes.8  \nB. \nThe panel\u2019s decision aligns with the \nFSIA\u2019s text. \nThe text of the FSIA reflects Congress\u2019s intent to \nallow suit against a foreign sovereign only where it \nhas contacts with the United States of the kind that \nwould satisfy due process standards. Petitioners point \nto section 1330(b), arguing that it requires only a \nshowing of subject matter jurisdiction plus proper \nservice to establish personal jurisdiction. E.g., \nDevas.Pet.11. But what section 1330(b) provides is \nthat personal jurisdiction exists where, in addition to \nproper service, the textual requirements of an \nexception to immunity set forth in section 1605 have \nbeen met. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b); see also id. \u00a7 \n1330(a) (jurisdiction exists only where \u201cthe foreign \n                                            \n8 Karen Halverson, Is a Foreign State a \u201cPerson\u201d?

Int\u2019l L. & Pol. 115, 122 \n(2001). \n\n17 \n \nstate is not entitled to immunity \u2026 under sections \n1605\u20131607 of this title\u201d).  \nThus, it is not the Ninth Circuit that has \u201cmixed \nup\u201d \nsubject \nmatter \nand \npersonal \njurisdiction \n(Devas.Pet.12, quoting Judge Bumatay\u2019s dissent from \nthe denial of en banc rehearing). It is Congress that \nchose to make the requirements of the exceptions \nprerequisites for establishing personal jurisdiction. \nAnd those exceptions, in turn, require some \nconnection between the parties, the dispute, and the \nUnited States. \nFor most of those exceptions, the required nexus \nto the United States satisfying both the exception and \nthe traditional requisites of due process are apparent.  \nFor example, the commercial activity exception, \ncodified at section 1605(a)(2), uses \u201cdirect effects\u201d \nlanguage which \u201cclosely resembles the \u2018minimum \ncontacts\u2019 language of constitutional due process and \nthese two analyses have overlapped.\u201d S & Davis Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. The Republic of Yemen, 218 F.3d 1292, 1304 \n(11th Cir. 2000); U.S. Fidelity & Guar. Co. v. \nBraspetro Oil Servs., Co., 199 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. \n1999) (\u201c[T]he Rein Court made explicit the finding \nthat was implicit in Hanil Bank, stating that \nquestions regarding minimum contacts for personal \njurisdiction purposes and commercial contacts for \nFSIA purposes were inextricably intertwined.\u201d). \nIndeed, \nthat \nwas \nthe \nbasis \nof \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nconstitutional conclusion in Republic of Argentina v. \nWeltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 619\u201320 (1992); i.e., that \nany due process requirements were satisfied by the \nsame debt issuance actions that satisfied the FSIA\u2019s \n\u201cdirect effects\u201d standard. See also Sec. Pac. Nat\u2019l Bank \n\n18 \n \nv. Derderian, 872 F.2d 281, 286\u201387 (9th Cir. 1989) \n(\u201cthe requirement of a \u2018direct effect\u2019 incorporates the \nminimum contacts standards of International Shoe\u201d); \nRein v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, \n162 F.3d 748, 760\u201361 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cThe finding of \nsubject matter jurisdiction under the commercial \nactivities exception also entail[s] a finding of \nminimum contacts[.]\u201d). \nSimilarly, under the expropriation exception, \nclaims involving rights in property taken in violation \nof international law may be heard if the property has \na commercial nexus with the United States. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(3). And that requirement may be met by \nshowing either that \u201cproperty is present in the United \nStates in connection with a commercial activity \ncarried on in the United States by the foreign state,\u201d \nor that \u201cproperty is owned or operated by an agency \nor instrumentality of the foreign state and that \nagency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial \nactivity[.]\u201d Zappia Middle E. Constr. Co. v. Emirate of \nAbu Dhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 2000).  \nSection 1605(a)(4), addressing cases \u201cin which \nrights in property in the United States acquired by \nsuccession or gift or rights in immovable property \nsituated in the United States are in issue,\u201d likewise \npresumes sufficient contacts with the U.S. to satisfy \nthe minimum contacts standard. The property must \neither be present in the United States in connection \nwith the foreign state\u2019s commercial activity, or owned \nor operated by an agent of that state engaged in \ncommercial activity in the forum. See Abelesz v. \nMagyar Nemzeti Bank, 692 F.3d 661, 686 (7th Cir. \n2012).  \n\n19 \n \nSection 1605(a)(5), in turn, denies immunity \u201cfor \npersonal injury or death, or damage to or loss of \nproperty, occurring in the United States and caused \nby the tortious act or omission of that foreign state\u201d\u2014 \nthus implicitly requiring a direct connection between \nthe dispute, the foreign sovereign, and the United \nStates. See Cmty. Fin. Grp., Inc. v. Republic of Kenya, \n663 F.3d 977, 982 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing Amerada \nHess Shipping Corp., 488 U.S. at 441). In other words, \na foreign sovereign must commit a tort that causes \nharm in the United States.   \nThe arbitration exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6), \nfollows the same model as the prior exceptions. It \nallows suit in the U.S. to \u201cenforce\u201d an arbitral \nagreement and \u201cconfirm\u201d the resulting award. Id. The \nrequired connection with the United States is implicit \nin the very notion of enforcement and confirmation, \nwhich requires the presence of the person against \nwhich to enforce the agreement or the property \nagainst which to confirm the award. Mark Feldman, \nChair of the Ad Hoc Committee on Revision of the \nFSIA, so observed, stating: \u201cEnforcement of arbitral \nawards \u2026 requires the presence of property of the \ndefendant in the United States.\u201d9 Feldman further \nnoted that \u201cthere would seem to be no unfairness in \nallowing an action to realize on [a] debt in a state \nwhere the defendant has property.\u201d10 Thus, Congress \nyet again demonstrated its intent to require a \n                                            \n9 Arbitral Awards: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Admin. \nLaw and Governmental Relations of the H. Comm. On the \nJudiciary, 99th Cong. 102\u201303 (1986). \n10 Id. at 98 (emphasis added). \n\n20 \n \nconnection between the dispute and the forum before \nallowing a suit against a foreign sovereign to proceed. \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision is thus consistent \nwith both Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the FSIA\u2019s \nexceptions and the language Congress chose to \nexpress that intent.  \nC. \nThe panel\u2019s decision aligns with the \nhistoric treatment of foreign \nsovereigns and reinforces the \nseparation of powers. \nIf the Court were to resolve the statutory question \nin Petitioners\u2019 favor, it would then need to reach the \nconstitutional aspect of the question: whether foreign \nsovereigns are \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to due process in \nUnited States courts. The Court should not rush to \ntake up that question, particularly in such an unusual \nand ill-suited vehicle (see Section IV, infra). \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 suggestion, there is \nnothing incongruent or ahistorical about applying \nbasic constitutional due process requirements when \nforeign sovereigns are sued in U.S. courts. Congress \nand the courts historically viewed foreign sovereigns \nas \u201cpersons.\u201d See People v. McLeod, 25 Wend. 483, \n536, 551\u201352, 595 (N.Y. 1841) (discussing the \nimputation of the acts of subjects to their sovereigns \nas though both are persons with moral and legal \nagency); The Schooner Exch. v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. \n116, 130 (1812) (explaining the possessive rights of \nsovereigns and the exercise of jurisdiction over \nsovereigns in terms of persons); see also The \nJurisdictional Immunity of Foreign Sovereigns, 63 \nYale L.J. 1148, 1149 (June 1954) (describing The \n\n21 \n \nSchooner Exchange as holding \u201cthat the immunity of \nthe sovereign person extended to the sovereign\u2019s \npublic armed vessels\u201d) (emphasis added). There is \nthus ample support for application of minimum \ncontacts analysis as a constitutional matter, not just \na statutory mandate. \n \nPetitioners make much of this Court\u2019s citation in \nWeltover, to South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. \n301 (1966). They characterize it as suggesting that \nforeign states should not be entitled to due process-\nbased protections if U.S. states are not. Petitioners \nmake too much of a \u201ccf\u201d citation to a decision that \u201cwas \nnot about personal jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cis explicitly \nlimited to \u2018States of the Union.\u2019\u201d Wuerth, 88 Fordham \nL. Rev. at 649. But were the Court to take up this \nissue, it would have to consider that, as an historic \nmatter, foreign sovereigns are very differently \nsituated, in terms of their relationship to the federal \ngovernment and our Constitution, than U.S. states.  \nWhen ratifying the Constitution, each U.S. state \nopted in to our unique federal structure, which is \ncharacterized by a particular balance between state \nand federal authority. See The Federalist No. 9 \n(Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe proposed Constitution, so \nfar from implying an abolition of the State \ngovernments, makes them constituent parts of the \nnational sovereignty, by allowing them a direct \nrepresentation in the Senate, and leaves in their \npossession certain exclusive and very important \nportions of sovereign power.\u201d). As a result of their \nstatus within the union, U.S. states enjoy many \nprivileges that foreign governments do not, including \nrepresentation for their citizens in Congress and the \n\n22 \n \nElectoral College;11 unrestricted access for their \nbusinesses to the common market of the United \nStates;12 freedom of travel throughout the nation for \ntheir residents;13 and full faith and credit afforded to \nthe judgments of their courts in the courts of all other \nstates.14 U.S. states also have recourse, should the \nfederal government take an action adverse to their \ninterests, through both judicial and legislative action. \nStates thus have an ability to influence the federal \ngovernment that a foreign sovereign could never hope \nto enjoy, even where there is a strong diplomatic \nrelationship. There is thus nothing anomalous in \nsuggesting that domestic and foreign states may be \ntreated differently for purposes of the due process \nclause and its application to personal jurisdiction. \nFinally, rather than violating the separation of \npowers as Petitioners assert (e.g., Devas.Pet.3), the \npanel\u2019s decision protects the Executive Branch\u2019s \nprimary role in conducting foreign relations. The \ndecision below, and the long line of precedent on \nwhich it is based, ensure that courts do not assert \njurisdiction so broadly as to interfere in foreign \ndisputes in which the U.S. has no interest or stake, \nand thereby threaten diplomatic relations with allies \nsuch as India.   \n                                            \n11 U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 2. \n12 See Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 380 \n(1976). \n13 See Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 501 (1999). \n14 U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 1. \n\n23 \n \nII. The decision below aligns with precedent \nfrom across the circuits. \nIn addition to being well grounded in the FSIA\u2019s \nhistory and text, the panel decision is no outlier, as \nPetitioners claim. E.g., Devas.Pet.2. It is consistent \nwith a long line of precedent applying minimum \ncontacts requirements in FSIA suits.  \nA. \nBefore and after Weltover, courts have \napplied minimum contacts \nrequirements in FSIA cases.  \nThe \nNinth \nCircuit\u2019s \ndecision \naligns \nwith \nprecedent from most of the remaining circuits. \nSpecifically, the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, \nand Eleventh Circuits have all determined, either \nimplicitly or explicitly, that the various FSIA \nexceptions to sovereign immunity reflect and embody \ntraditional due process standards, requiring a \nminimum contacts analysis to exercise jurisdiction. \nFor example, in Stena Rederi AB v. Comision de \nContratos del Comite Ejecutivo General del Sindicato \nRevolucionario de Trabajadores Petroleros de la \nRepublica Mexicana, S.C., the Fifth Circuit held that \nthere was no jurisdiction under the commercial \nactivities exception due to the lack of connection \nbetween the dispute and the United States. 923 F.2d \n380, 391 (5th Cir. 1991). The court of appeals opined: \n\u201cPemex\u2019s commercial operations are not of sufficient \nimport\u2014both in relation to the territorial boundaries \nof the United States and Stena\u2019s causes of action\u2014to \nsupport \u2026 jurisdiction under the FSIA.\u201d Id. In the \ncourse of its analysis, the court noted: \u201cAs with all \n\n24 \n \nsuits \u2026 the exercise of personal jurisdiction must \ncomport with the requirements of due process.\u201d Id. at \n386 n.8 (citing Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., 764 F.2d \n1101, 1107 n.5 (5th Cir. 1985)). \nThe Sixth Circuit also employs a minimum \ncontacts analysis in FSIA cases. In Antoine v. Atlas \nTurner, \nInc., \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendant, \n\u201can \ninstrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d argued \u201cthat the \nDistrict Court lacked personal jurisdiction because \nAtlas did not have the requisite minimum contacts \nwith the State of Ohio.\u201d 66 F.3d 105, 109, 111 (6th Cir. \n1995). The court rejected this argument\u2014but not \nbecause \nit \nthought \nminimum \ncontacts \nwere \nunnecessary. To the contrary, the court adopted \nNinth Circuit precedent applying the minimum \ncontacts analysis, explained how to conduct the \nminimum contacts analysis in an FSIA case, and \nupheld the lower court\u2019s conclusion that defendant \nhad sufficient contacts in the United States. Id.  \nThe Eighth, Third, and Fourth Circuits have \nsimilarly expressed agreement with the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requiring a minimum contacts showing \nto allow a suit to proceed under the FSIA. See BP \nChems. Ltd., an Eng. Corp. v. Jiangsu SOPO Corp. \n(Grp.) Ltd., 420 F.3d 810, 818 (8th Cir. 2005) (\u201cThe \ndistrict court found SOPO had sufficient contacts \nwith the United States to fit within the commercial \nactivity exception of the FSIA. We believe this is \ndispositive of the related issue whether SOPO had \nsufficient minimum contacts with an American forum \nthat it could be expected to be haled into court \nthere.\u201d); Velidor v. L/P/G Benghazi, 653 F.2d 812, \n819 n.12 (3d Cir. 1981) (\u201cWe must also inquire \u2026 \n\n25 \n \nwhether the assertion of personal jurisdiction \ncomports with the due process clause.\u201d); cf. Gerding v. \nRepublic of France, 943 F.2d 521, 527 (4th Cir. 1991) \n(\u201cWhen the district court examined these contacts it \nfound that the Gerdings had not satisfied the due \nprocess \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 standard, much less the \nFSIA\u2019s \u2018substantial contacts\u2019 requirement.\u201d). \nThe Eleventh Circuit also requires minimum \ncontacts, notwithstanding Petitioners\u2019 argument to \nthe contrary. Before Weltover, the Eleventh Circuit \nevaluated minimum contacts in detail when assessing \npersonal jurisdiction under the FSIA, explaining that, \nbecause the FSIA \u201ccannot create personal jurisdiction \nwhere the Constitution forbids it, we must assess the \nexercise of authority against the standards of due \nprocess.\u201d Harris Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Iranian Radio & \nTelevision, 691 F.2d 1344, 1352 (11th Cir. 1982) \n(internal quotation omitted). After Weltover, the \nEleventh Circuit continues to do so. See Vermeulen v. \nRenault, U.S.A., Inc., 985 F.2d 1534, 1545 (11th Cir. \n1993) \n(\u201cBecause \nwe \nsimilarly \nconclude \nthat \n[Defendant, a government-owned car manufacturer] \npossessed minimum contacts to satisfy the Due \nProcess Clause, we likewise hold that the exercise of \nfederal jurisdiction in this case would not violate \n[Defendant\u2019s] constitutional rights.\u201d). The Eleventh \nCircuit case on which Petitioners rely to suggest \notherwise did not address whether the foreign \nsovereign was entitled to due process, instead holding \nthat minimum contacts existed under the FSIA\u2019s \ncommercial activity exception. See S & Davis Int\u2019l, \nInc., 218 F.3d at 1303\u201304 (\u201cWe do not need to \ndetermine the precise constitutional status of a \n\n26 \n \nforeign sovereign because we find that the due process \nrequirements have been met[.]\u201d). \nThus, far from being an outlier, the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s unreported decision comports with the rule \napplied by a majority of circuits: i.e., that there must \nbe some connection between the parties, the dispute, \nand the United States for a foreign sovereign to be \nhauled into U.S. court. And that rule, in turn, rests on \nfundamental due process and fairness principles, \nwhich this Court should not rush to abandon. \nB. \nThe contrary precedent on which \nPetitioners rely arises out of the \nFSIA\u2019s terrorism exception, which is \ndifferent in text and intent. \nThe cases on which Petitioners rely to argue that \nminimum contacts requirements do not apply in FSIA \ncases\u2014either as a matter of statutory text or \nconstitutional right\u2014are drawn from a minority of \ncircuits that reached that conclusion based on \nprecedent assessing a unique FSIA exception not at \nissue here: the terrorism exception.  \nSpecifically, the Second and Seventh Circuits \nrelied on the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Price to hold \nthat a minimum contacts analysis is not required in \nFSIA cases. See Frontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. \nState Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, \n399 (2d Cir. 2009) (relying on Price); Abelesz, 692 F.3d \nat 694 (citing Price and Frontera). The Second Circuit, \nhowever, has since questioned the validity of its \ndecision to broadly dispense with due process \nprotections for foreign sovereigns. See Gater Assets \n\n27 \n \nLtd. v. AO Moldovagaz, 2 F.4th 42, 66 n.24 (2d Cir. \n2021) (\u201cRecent scholarship questions our earlier \nholding in Frontera that foreign sovereigns do not \nqualify as persons under the Due Process Clause.\u201d). \nIn any event, Price\u2019s analysis of the terrorism \nexception does not support applying its reasoning to \nother FSIA exceptions. \nIn Price, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged that, \n\u201c[w]hen Congress passed the original FSIA, it was \nassumed that the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nover foreign states under the statute always would \nsatisfy the demands of the Constitution.\u201d 294 F.3d at \n90. But the court explained that the text of the \nterrorism exception did not reflect the same intent. \nSee id. (\u201cThe antiterrorism amendments changed this \nstatutory framework.\u201d). Rather, on its face, that \nexception\u2019s text indicated Congress\u2019s intent to allow \nsuits based on acts of terror against U.S. nationals \nand employees to proceed, even where the connection \nto the United States would not satisfy traditional \n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d standards. Id.15   \nBoth Petitioners and Judge Bumatay, in his \nopinion dissenting from denial of en banc review, \nhighlight the terrorism exception case law. But there \nis nothing in the unpublished decision below or prior \nNinth Circuit precedent that would prevent a future \npanel addressing the terrorism exception from \n                                            \n15 Having determined that application of the terrorism exception \ndid not require a minimum contacts showing, the Price court \nconsidered whether constitutional due process applies to foreign \nsovereigns (294 F.3d at 95\u201399). The Ninth Circuit did not reach \nthat issue here, and this Court should not reach it either. \n\n28 \n \nreaching the same conclusion as the Price court. The \nunique text, context, and history of the terrorism \nexception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A, may well overcome any \nassumption that Congress expected traditional due \nprocess concerns to limit jurisdiction over foreign \nsovereigns. But that issue is not presented here. \nThis case concerns the FSIA\u2019s arbitral award \nenforcement exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6), for \nwhich there is no indication that Congress intended \nthe traditional rule requiring some connection \nbetween the dispute, the parties, and the forum before \nhauling a foreign state (let alone a state-owned \ncorporation) into U.S. court to fall by the wayside. The \narbitral exception also presents none of the special \nforeign policy concerns associated with protecting \nU.S. nationals and government employees abroad \nfrom terrorism. Where a foreign sovereign has had no \nrelevant contact with the United States, has no \npresence in the forum, and has no property in the \nforum against which to enforce a judgment, it is \ndifficult to identify any interest that the United \nStates has in lending its courts to enforcement actions \nfor foreign arbitral awards. Conversely, it would be \nunfair to subject a foreign sovereign to suit in such \ncircumstances. \nWere Petitioners\u2019 view to prevail, the result would \nbe highly incongruous: only the arbitration exception \nwould allow an FSIA suit to proceed in a U.S. court \nwhere there is no connection between the foreign \nparties, their dispute, and the forum, but rather was \nbrought solely to subject a foreign sovereign to U.S.-\nstyle discovery. This Court should not rush to re-\n\n29 \n \ninterpret the FSIA\u2019s immunity exceptions in such an \nillogical and imbalanced way. \nIndeed, even the terrorism exception requires a \nconnection between the suit and the United States; \nsuit may only be brought by U.S. nationals, \ngovernment employees or contractors, or members of \nthe armed forces. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(2)(A)(ii). \nThus, relying on the terrorism exception to jettison \nthe minimum contacts test for all FSIA exceptions is \nillogical. That a few circuits continue to apply the rule \narising out of Price\u2019s examination of the terrorism \nexception in other FSIA cases does not create a need \nfor this court to re-examine the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlongstanding application of traditional minimum \ncontacts requirements. \nPetitioner Devas argues that the panel\u2019s decision \n\u201cundermines Congress\u2019s goal of creating \u2018a uniform \nbody of law concerning the amenability of a foreign \nsovereign \nto \nsuit \nin \nUnited \nStates \ncourts.\u2019\u201d \nDevas.Pet.3 (quoting First National City Bank v. \nBanco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. \n611, 622 n.11 (1983) (\u201cBancec\u201d). But it is the few \ncircuits that have extended an exemption to the \nminimum contacts requirement that arose out of the \npeculiarities of the terrorism exception to other FSIA \nclaims that have undermined an otherwise uniform \nbody of law recognizing that due process must be \nobserved for a foreign state to be hauled into U.S. \ncourts. The Ninth Circuit did nothing more than \napply the traditional rule to a case where there is \nplainly no connection between the parties, the \ndispute, and the United States. There is no cause for \nthis Court to review that unremarkable decision.  \n\n30 \n \nIII. The question presented rarely arises.  \nThe panel opinion rightly recognized that the \nquestion of whether there must be minimum contacts \nto sue under the FSIA\u2019s arbitration exception rarely \narises, for a simple reason: \u201cIn most cases involving \nthe enforcement of an arbitral award[,]\u201d that \nrequirement \u201ccan easily be satisfied by the presence \nof assets in the forum.\u201d Int.Pet.App.11a. The \nconcurring opinion further noted that Petitioners \n\u201cforfeited\u201d their opportunity to invoke jurisdiction on \nthat basis, even in briefing on appeal, after learning \nof funds owed to Antrix in Virginia. That makes it \nparticularly inappropriate to use this case as the \nvehicle for this Court to take up the questions of \nwhether either the FSIA or the Constitution requires \na minimum contacts analysis. Int.Pet.App.12a.  \nPetitioners nonetheless assert that the issue \npresented here is likely to recur because foreign states \nare regularly sued in the Ninth Circuit. Int.Pet.22. \nBut the cases they cite only demonstrate, by contrast, \nhow unique the issue raised here is: \n\uf0b7 Mohammad v. General Consulate of State of \nKuwait in L.A., 28 F.4th 980, 983\u201384 (9th Cir. \n2022), was brought under the commercial \nactivities exception; the defendant consulate \nwas a California employer with substantial \ncontacts with the forum; and the cause of action \narose from those contacts. \n\uf0b7 The Ninth Circuit resolved Broidy Capital \nManagement, LLC v. State of Qatar, 982 F.3d \n582, 594\u201396 (9th Cir. 2020), by concluding that \n\n31 \n \nneither \nthe \ntortious \nconduct \nnor \nthe \ncommercial activity exceptions applied based \non the facts of the case.  \n\uf0b7 The Ninth Circuit dismissed claims against the \nUkraine in Baiul-Farina v. Lemire, 804 F. \nApp\u2019x 533, 537 (9th Cir. 2020), because the \nstate was \u201cfraudulently joined.\u201d \n\uf0b7 In Sequeira v. Republic of Nicaragua, 791 F. \nApp\u2019x 681 (9th Cir. 2020), the Ninth Circuit \nagreed that the plaintiff did not allege facts \nshowing that the defendant was subject to the \nwaiver or commercial activity exceptions. \n\uf0b7 In Sukyas v. Romania, 765 F. App\u2019x 179, 179\u2013\n80 (9th Cir. 2019), the Ninth Circuit affirmed \nthat defendant lacked sufficient connections \nwith the United States to come within the \ncommercial activities exception, but ordered \nthe district court to reevaluate whether the \nexpropriation exception applied.  \n \nNone of these cases concern the FSIA\u2019s arbitration \nexception. Most simply addressed whether a plaintiff \nhad alleged facts sufficient to meet the specific \nrequirements of some other exception.  Thus, far from \nbeing an issue of great importance, the issue raised \nhere is an obscure one. But if the Court were to take \nit up and broadly hold, as Petitioners ask, that there \nare no minimum contacts requirements to sue a \nforeign sovereign under any FSIA exception, the \nCourt would be opening the doors of all U.S. courts\u2014\nand our liberal discovery process\u2014to foreign disputes \nthat have no connection to the United States.  \n\n32 \n \nIV. The question is not cleanly presented here. \nThis case is unique, and the context is strange. It \ndoes not present the question Petitioners seek to raise \n\u201ccleanly,\u201d as they claim. Int.Pet.24; Devas.Pet.20. \nQuite the opposite; there are several threshold issues \nthat logically precede that question, and that make \nthis case an inappropriate vehicle for the Court to \nresolve the question posed.  \nA. \nThe arbitral award no longer exists. \nIt would be incongruous for the Court to take up \nthe issue raised here\u2014whether there must be a \nminimum contacts showing when a foreign entity is \nsued under the FSIA\u2019s arbitral award exception\u2014\nwhen there is no longer an arbitral award to enforce \nbecause it has been set aside by the court of competent \njurisdiction in the country where it was made. \nHaving resolved the issue on minimum contacts, \nthe Ninth Circuit did not have occasion to consider \nthis case\u2019s unique posture: there is no longer an \nAward to enforce because the Delhi High Court set it \naside. ECF 72 at 28\u2013115; ECF 85 at 2\u2013134. No party \ndisputes that the Delhi High Court\u2014Devas\u2019s chosen \nforum\u2014is the court of competent jurisdiction to \ndecide the validity of the Award. ER-251\u2013252; 3-ER-\n351\u2013354. And the Indian Supreme Court has \ndismissed Devas\u2019s final appeal to that decision. See \nECF 116, Attach. A. \nThe Delhi High Court\u2019s set-aside of the Award \nrendered it unenforceable under the New York \nConvention. See N.Y. Convention Guide, Art. V(1)(e); \n\n33 \n \n9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Every circuit court to address the issue \nhas held that \u201can arbitration award does not exist to \nbe enforced \u2026 if it has been lawfully \u2018set aside\u2019 by a \ncompetent authority in the State in which the award \nwas made.\u201d TermoRio S.A. E.S.P. v. Electranta S.P., \n487 F.3d 928, 935\u201336 (D.C. Cir. 2007); see Esso Expl. \n& Prod. Nigeria Ltd. v. Nigerian Nat\u2019l Petroleum \nCorp. (\u201cEsso\u201d), 40 F.4th 56, 74 (2d Cir. 2022); Getma \nInt\u2019l v. Republic of Guinea, 862 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Baker Marine (Nig.) Ltd. v. Chevron (Nig.) Ltd., \n191 F.3d 194, 197\u201398 (2d Cir. 1999). The result is the \nsame even when the award is set aside after a \njudgment \nenforcing \nit. \nSee \nThai-Lao \nLignite \n(Thailand) Co. v. Gov\u2019t of Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, 864 F.3d 172, 179\u201380 (2d Cir. 2017). A suit \ncannot be brought under the FSIA\u2019s arbitration \nexception to enforce an award that does not exist. \nOnly twice have circuit courts refused to recognize \na set-aside as \u201crepugnant to fundamental notions of \nwhat is decent and just.\u201d See Corporacion Mexicana \nDe Mantenimiento Integral, S. De R.L. De C.V. v. \nPemex-Exploracion Y Produccion, 832 F.3d 92, 108\u2013\n10 (2d Cir. 2016) (addressing retroactive law resulting \nin \npublic \ntaking); \nCompania \nde \nInversiones \nMercantiles S.A. v. Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua \nS.A.B. de C.V., 58 F.4th 429, 460\u201361 (10th Cir. 2023) \n(parties waived right to seek annulment). That \n\u201cstandard is high, and infrequently met,\u201d Esso, 40 \nF.4th at 73\u201374 (internal quotation omitted). No such \nshowing could be made here, where the set-aside \ndecision was thoroughly explained by the Delhi High \nCourt, properly considered on appeal, and has been \nconfirmed by the Indian Supreme Court.  \n\n34 \n \nThe judgment enforcing the Award thus cannot \nstand, even setting aside the minimum contacts issue. \nPetitioners argue that this Court could address the \ndue process issues they raise, leaving for later \nwhether there is an extant award to enforce, but offer \nlittle explanation as to why this Court should choose \nto take up such questions in the context of an attempt \nto enforce an award that no longer exists.  \nB. \nAntrix is a state-owned corporation, \nnot a foreign government.  \nEven if this Court were inclined to determine \nwhether foreign states lack due process rights under \nboth the FSIA and the Constitution, the answer to \nthat question would not directly address the question \nof Antrix\u2019s due process protections as a foreign \ncorporation. See Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 \n(2014); Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. \nHall, 466 U.S. 408, 416 (1984) (finding insufficient \nminimum contacts to allow suit to proceed against \nColumbian government-owned corporation). As a \nforeign corporation that is independently operated, \nAntrix is entitled to due process protections absent a \nparticular (and onerous) showing of control by the \nforeign state. Bancec, 462 U.S. at 626\u201327. \nThis traditional rule that foreign state-owned \ncorporations have due process rights so long as they \nhave separate legal persona would quickly render \nirrelevant the questions presented to this Court \nregarding a foreign sovereign\u2019s entitlement to a \nminimum contacts analysis, whether based on the \nFSIA or the Constitution. Under this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, state-owned companies are \u201cjuridical \n\n35 \n \nentities \ndistinct \nand \nindependent \nfrom \ntheir \nsovereign\u201d unless there is a showing of both extensive \ncontrol of the corporation by the foreign state, and \nthat the corporation was used for fraudulent \npurposes. Bancec, 462 U.S. at 626\u201327; Doe v. Holy See, \n557 F.3d 1066, 1076\u201380 (9th Cir. 2009) (applying \nBancec \nanalysis \nto \ndetermine \nthat \nacts \nby \n\u201ccorporations created by the Holy See\u201d could not be \nattributed to it); Gater Assets Ltd., 2 F.4th at 56 \n(finding same for corporation of Republic of Moldova). \nNothing in the decisions of the courts below suggests \nthat Antrix would be deprived of due process under a \nproper Bancec analysis. The district court did not \neven cite Bancec, see Int.Pet.App.17a-35a, and the \nNinth Circuit did not address it in its decision.   \nBut a proper Bancec analysis would obviate the \nneed to answer the question that Petitioners ask this \ncourt to take up. There is no need to consider whether \nforeign states are entitled to due process protections, \neither as a matter of statutory text or constitutional \nright, if Antrix\u2014as a foreign corporation\u2014is entitled \nto such protections anyway. This Court should decline \nto take up the statutory and constitutional issues \nraised by Petitioners where their resolution would not \ndispose of this case. \nIntervenor-Petitioners make the unremarkable \npoint that the Court of Appeals could address any \nother issues raised by this case on remand. Int.Pet.25. \nBut they fail to grapple with the fact that the issues \ndiscussed above make this case a poor vehicle to \naddress the questions they raise. The cases \nIntervenor-Petitioners cite did not leave similar \nissues for the lower courts to address on remand\u2014let \n\n36 \n \nalone issues that similarly call into question the \nvalidity of taking further action in the case. In \nSamantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 311, 325\u201326 \n(2010), the Court held that the FSIA does not address \nthe immunity claims of foreign officials, and left it for \nthe lower courts to determine on remand whether \ncommon law alternatively entitled the defendant to \nimmunity. And the Court in GE Energy Power \nConversion France SAS, Corp. v. Outokumpu \nStainless USA, LLC, 590 U.S. 432, 445 (2020), simply \nheld that domestic principles of equitable estoppel do \nnot conflict with the New York Convention, and then \nleft it to the court of appeals to apply those principles \nto an arbitration clause.

          "task_beliefs": "My previous beliefs, formed after analyzing the petitioner's merits brief, remain stable. The latest observation was an internal reasoning step, confirming my information-gathering strategy rather than providing new external information about the case. It solidifies my current understanding and highlights the primary source of remaining uncertainty.\n\nMy current, unchanged beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Strategy:** The petitioner's case rests on a two-pronged argument that the \"minimum contacts\" test is inapplicable to foreign sovereigns under the FSIA, both as a matter of statutory interpretation and constitutional law.\n\n2.  **Statutory Argument (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioner's textualist argument is unchanged. It centers on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b), which states that personal jurisdiction \"**shall exist**\" once subject-matter jurisdiction and proper service are established. The petitioner argues this creates an exhaustive, two-part test, leaving no room for a judicially-imposed third requirement of minimum contacts. This argument aims to portray the FSIA as a complete and exclusive jurisdictional framework, citing precedents like *Verlinden B.V.* and *Republic of Sudan v. Harrison*.\n\n3.  **Constitutional Argument (Stable):** My belief about the petitioner's constitutional challenge is also stable. It has two layers:\n    *   **Primary Claim:** Foreign states are not \"persons\" protected by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, a novel argument drawing on dicta from *Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.* and analogies to the status of U.S. States (*South Carolina v. Katzenbach*).\n    *   **Alternative Claim:** Even if foreign states are \"persons,\" the process they are due is defined by the political branches through the FSIA itself, not by the judiciary's *International Shoe* framework. The FSIA's comprehensive scheme of immunity exceptions and service rules *is* the constitutionally sufficient process.\n\n4.  **Policy Arguments (Stable):** The petitioner's policy arguments\u2014that imposing minimum contacts would disrupt the FSIA's \"comprehensive scheme\" and violate international obligations under the New York Convention\u2014remain key components of my understanding of their position.\n\nThe recent observation confirms that my analysis of the petitioner's arguments is complete and that the most critical missing piece of information is the respondent's (Antrix Corp. Ltd.) counter-argument. My predictive model is currently weighted heavily with the petitioner's perspective. The next crucial update to my beliefs will come from observing and analyzing the respondent's merits brief, which will directly challenge these statutory and constitutional claims. My uncertainty remains focused on the strength and nature of those forthcoming rebuttals.",

By explicitly identifying the Solicitor General's brief as the next most informative document, the agent formulates an optimal plan to resolve this new uncertainty. This planning step significantly increases the probability of making a correct final prediction by focusing resources on the most pivotal piece of missing evidence. \n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action codifies a powerful and generalizable heuristic for SCOTUS prediction: in cases involving the interpretation of federal statutes with foreign policy implications (like the FSIA), the views of the United States, expressed by the Solicitor General, are given immense weight by the Court. The thought process explicitly articulates this principle, making it a reusable strategic insight for the agent's design.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs have been substantially updated by the respondent's (Antrix Corp. Ltd.) Brief in Opposition. While this is not the final merits brief, it reveals Antrix's core legal strategy and provides the first direct rebuttal to the petitioner's arguments. My understanding has evolved from a one-sided view based on the petitioner's claims to a more balanced, adversarial perspective.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Strategy (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioner's two-pronged statutory and constitutional argument remains unchanged. They argue that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) creates an exhaustive two-part test for personal jurisdiction (subject-matter jurisdiction + service) that displaces the judicial `International Shoe` minimum contacts analysis, and that, constitutionally, foreign sovereigns are not \"persons\" entitled to Fifth Amendment due process.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Counter-Arguments (New and Foundational):** The observation of Antrix's Brief in Opposition introduces their primary defensive theories, which significantly complicate the petitioner's narrative.\n    *   **Statutory Counter-Interpretation:** Antrix directly counters the petitioner's textualist argument. They contend that the FSIA's legislative history and structure demonstrate that Congress *intended* to incorporate, not eliminate, the `International Shoe` minimum contacts standard. The various exceptions to immunity were drafted to be consistent with traditional notions of jurisdiction based on a defendant's contacts with the forum. They argue that Congress did not intend to open every U.S. courthouse to any international arbitration dispute, regardless of its connection to the United States, as this would violate principles of comity.\n    *   **Precedent Re-framing (The \"Terrorism Exception\" Distinction):** This is a critical new insight. Antrix argues that the petitioner's key precedents for dispensing with minimum contacts arise from the FSIA's state-sponsored terrorism exception (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A). Antrix frames this exception as a unique, congressionally-mandated \"outlier\" with a different text and intent, designed specifically to provide a forum for U.S. nationals harmed by terrorism. They cite `Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya` to argue that even cases applying the terrorism exception acknowledged that the *other* FSIA exceptions, like the arbitration exception at issue here, still incorporate minimum contacts requirements. This strategy attempts to neutralize the petitioner's strongest supporting case law by confining it to a distinct context.\n\n3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Strategy (New and Highly Significant):** Perhaps the most important new information is Antrix's introduction of two powerful \"off-ramps\" that would allow the Supreme Court to rule in its favor without deciding the broad, novel constitutional question of whether foreign *states* are \"persons.\"\n    *   **Entity Distinction:** Antrix emphasizes that it is a state-owned *corporation*, not the foreign sovereign itself (the Republic of India). Citing precedent like `First National City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba`, Antrix argues that such distinct corporate entities are presumptively \"persons\" entitled to due process, even if they are considered instrumentalities of a foreign state for immunity purposes. This creates a path for the Court to find that Antrix is owed a minimum contacts analysis without ever reaching the question of what a sovereign state is owed.\n    *   **Vehicle Problem/Mootness:** Antrix highlights that the underlying arbitral award has been set aside by India's Supreme Court. They argue this makes the case a poor \"vehicle\" for deciding the important legal question, as there may no longer be a live award to enforce. This procedural posture gives the Court a reason to avoid a merits ruling altogether.\n\n4.  **Updated Predictive Model:** My predictive model is now far more complex. The petitioner's clean textual and constitutional arguments are met with a robust counter-narrative based on legislative intent, precedent distinction, and, most crucially, doctrines of constitutional avoidance. The \"entity distinction\" argument appears particularly strong, as it offers the Court a narrow, case-specific basis to affirm the Ninth Circuit. My confidence in a victory for the petitioner has decreased, and I now see a significant probability that the Court will either rule for the respondent on narrow grounds or dismiss the case as an improper vehicle, thereby leaving the core constitutional question unanswered. The key uncertainty is no longer just \"what will the respondent say,\" but \"which of these avoidance doctrines, if any, will the Court find most persuasive?\"",

The proposed action seeks the amicus brief from the Solicitor General (SG), which is the single most informative piece of evidence available to resolve this uncertainty. The SG's view is highly influential, especially in cases involving federal statutes (FSIA) and foreign relations. The SG's position\u2014whether it supports the petitioner's broad theory, the respondent's narrow one, or carves a middle path\u2014will cause a maximal update to my predictive model. Therefore, the Task EIG is 1.0. For Design EIG, this action provides a perfect test case for a core hypothesis in SCOTUS prediction: the high predictive power of the SG's brief, particularly when it offers the Court a path of constitutional avoidance.

Civil litigation against foreign sov-\nereigns in federal and state courts can have significant \nforeign-relations implications for the United States and \ncan affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States \nin the courts of other nations.  The United States thus \nhas a substantial interest in this case. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. This case arises from a contractual dispute be-\ntween petitioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (De-\n\n2 \n \nvas) and respondent Antrix Corp. (respondent).  Devas \nis a private corporation established by a group of Amer-\nican investors and executives under the laws of the Re-\npublic of India.  23-1201 Pet. App. (Pet. App.) 17a, 53a.  \nRespondent\u2014an Indian corporation that markets goods \nand services for the Indian government\u2019s space agencies\n\u2014is wholly owned, and has much of its leadership ap-\npointed, by the Government of India.  Id. at 14a-15a, 53a. \nIn 2005, respondent entered into a contract with De-\nvas (20-36024 C.A. E.R. (E.R.) 246-253) to build, launch, \nand operate two communications satellites, from which \nrespondent would provide Devas with leased communi-\ncations bandwidth that Devas would then use to provide \naudio, video, and information services across India.  Id. \nat 246.  The contract\u2019s mandatory arbitration provision \napplies to \u201cany dispute or difference between the [p]art-\nies\u201d under the contract.  Id. at 251-252.  It provides that \nany resulting arbitral decision or award \u201cshall be final, \nbinding and conclusive on the Parties and entitled to be \nenforced to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and \nentered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at \n252; see Pet. App. 18a (reproducing provision). 0F1 \nIn 2011, respondent terminated the contract.  Pet \nApp. 18a.  Devas then commenced arbitration proceed-\nings under the International Chamber of Commerce \nrules of arbitration.  Id. at 18a-19a.  In 2015, an arbitral \npanel seated in New Delhi, India, found that respondent \nhad \u201cwrongfully repudiated\u201d the contract and entered a \nfinal arbitral award awarding Devas $562.5 million plus \ninterest.  Id. at 20a (citation and brackets omitted); see \nE.R. 54-156 (arbitral award). \n \n1 The contract defines \u201cLaws\u201d to mean \u201call laws, statutes, rules, \nregulations, ordinances, by-laws and other pronouncements having \nthe effect of law of India.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 2-1, at 129 (Sept. 13, 2018). \n\n3 \n \nb. The United States and India are parties to the \nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of \nForeign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), done \nJune 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S. No. 6997.  Both \nnations have agreed under the Convention to recognize \nand enforce arbitral awards concerning \u201ccommercial\u201d \nlegal relationships made \u201cin the territory of [any other] \nContracting State.\u201d  Id. Art. I(3), 21 U.S.T. 2519; see id. \nnote, 21 U.S.T. 2563, 2566.  The Convention provides \nthat, with certain exceptions, each contracting state \n\u201cshall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce \nthem in accordance with the rules of procedure of the \nterritory where the award is relied upon.\u201d  Id. Arts. III \nand V, 21 U.S.T. 2519-2520. \nCongress implemented the New York Convention in \n1970 by directing that the Convention \u201cshall be enforced \nin United States courts in accordance with [9 U.S.C. \n201-208].\u201d  9 U.S.C. 201.  If a party to arbitration timely \napplies for an order confirming an \u201carbitral award fall-\ning under the Convention,\u201d a district court \u201cshall con-\nfirm the award\u201d unless \u201cit finds one of the grounds \n[specified in the Convention] for refusal or deferral of \nrecognition or enforcement of the award.\u201d  9 U.S.C. 207. \n2. In 2018, Devas petitioned the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Washington to \nconfirm the 2015 arbitral award.  20-36024 Intervenors\u2019 \nC.A. Supp. E.R. (Supp. E.R.) 75-90.  Devas argued that \njurisdiction and venue were proper under the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \n1330, 1391(f\u200a), 1441(d), 1602 et seq.  Supp. E.R. 77-78. \na. The FSIA provides \u201cthe sole basis for obtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this \ncountry.\u201d  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434, 443 (1989).  The Act\u2019s def-\n\n4 \n \ninition of \u201c\u200a\u2018foreign state\u2019\u200a\u201d applies \u201c[f\u200a]or purposes of [28 \nU.S.C. 1602-1611]\u201d and where otherwise incorporated \nby reference, as in Section 1330.  28 U.S.C. 1603(a).  \nThat definition includes a foreign state, \u201ca political sub-\ndivision of a foreign state,\u201d and \u201can agency or instru-\nmentality of a foreign state.\u201d  Ibid.  An \u201c\u200a\u2018agency or in-\nstrumentality of a foreign state,\u2019\u200a\u201d in turn, is \u201cany en-\ntity\u201d (1) which is a \u201cseparate legal person, corporate or \notherwise\u201d; (2) \u201cwhich is an organ of a foreign state or \npolitical subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d or \u201ca majority of whose \nshares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign \nstate or political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d; and (3) which is \n\u201cneither a citizen of a State of the United States,\u201d \u201cnor \ncreated under the laws of any third country.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1603(b).  Under the FSIA, a \u201cforeign state\u201d as thus de-\nfined \u201cshall be immune from the jurisdiction\u201d of a fed-\neral or state court in a civil action, unless that action is \nexpressly permitted by certain international agree-\nments or by the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign \nimmunity at 28 U.S.C. 1605-1607.  28 U.S.C. 1604; see \nTurkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. \n264, 272-273 (2023). \nAs relevant here, the FSIA includes an exception to \nforeign sovereign immunity, enacted in 1988, for certain \ncivil actions brought \u201ceither to enforce,\u201d or \u201cto confirm \nan award made pursuant to,\u201d \u201can agreement to arbi-\ntrate\u201d that has been \u201cmade by the foreign state with or \nfor the benefit of a private party\u201d with respect to \u201ca de-\nfined legal relationship\u201d concerning \u201ca subject matter \ncapable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6).  That excep-\ntion applies in four specified contexts, including where \n\u201cthe agreement or award is or may be governed by a \ntreaty or other international agreement in force for the \n\n5 \n \nUnited States calling for the recognition and enforce-\nment of arbitral awards.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6)(B). \nThe FSIA\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d gov-\nerning civil actions against foreign states includes pro-\nvisions addressing, inter alia, federal \u201csubject-matter \njurisdiction,\u201d \u201cpersonal jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cvenue.\u201d  Am-\nerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 & n.3 (citation omitted).  \nFirst, 28 U.S.C. 1330(a) vests federal district courts \nwith \u201coriginal jurisdiction without regard to amount in \ncontroversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign \nstate as defined in [S]ection 1603(a) * * * as to any claim \nfor relief in personam with respect to which the foreign \nstate is not entitled to immunity either under sections \n1605-1607 of [Title 28] or under any applicable interna-\ntional agreement.\u201d  Ibid. \nSecond, 28 U.S.C. 1330(b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal \njurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have juris-\ndiction under [Section 1330](a) where service has been \nmade under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b). \nThird, the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme * * * \naddresses venue,\u2019\u200a\u201d Turkiye Halk Bankasi, 598 U.S. at \n273, by specifying four categories of venue for \u201c[a] civil \naction against a foreign state as defined in [28 U.S.C.] \n1603(a).\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a).  Venue is proper \u201cin any \njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a sub-\nstantial part of property that is the subject of the action \nis situated.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(1).  If the action is \nagainst \u201can agency or instrumentality of a foreign \nstate,\u201d venue is also proper \u201cin any judicial district in \nwhich the agency or instrumentality is licensed to do \nbusiness or is doing business.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(3). \n\n6 \n \nb. Devas alleged that respondent was an \u201cagency or \ninstrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1603(b), \nbut that Devas\u2019s suit fell within Section 1605(a)(6)(B)\u2019s \nexception to sovereign immunity because Devas sought  \nto confirm an award made pursuant to respondent\u2019s ar-\nbitration agreement, which is governed by the New \nYork Convention.  Supp. E.R. 77-78.  Devas alleged that  \nsubject-matter and personal jurisdiction therefore were \nproper under Section 1330(a) and (b).  Id. at 78.  And \nDevas alleged that \u201c[v]enue is proper\u201d in the Western \nDistrict of Washington under the FSIA\u2019s venue provi-\nsion, because respondent \u201cengages in business in th[at] \ndistrict\u201d by contracting with companies having head-\nquarters in the district to sell respondent\u2019s \u201csatellite \nlaunch\u201d and \u201cspace communications services\u201d to cus-\ntomers.  Id. at 77-78. \nRespondent moved to dismiss the petition.  Respond-\nent did not dispute that it is a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the \nFSIA, that service had been properly made, or that the \nFSIA\u2019s arbitral exception applied.  Pet. App. 4a, 21a-\n22a, 54a.  Nor did respondent dispute that it was doing \nbusiness in the district or that venue therein was thus \nproper under Section 1391(f\u200a)(3).  Respondent instead \nargued that the Due Process Clause\u2019s constitutional re-\nquirement for personal jurisdiction requires \u201c\u200a\u2018minimum \ncontacts\u2019 with the United States\u201d but those contacts had \nnot been established.  Id. at 21a-22a; see id. at 13a. \nThe district court denied respondent\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss.  Pet. App. 13a-16a.  The court concluded that \u201cthe \ndue process clause does not apply\u201d on the ground that \n\u201c[respondent] is not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes \nbecause it is effectively controlled by the Government \nof India,\u201d which \u201cexercises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over [re-\nspondent].\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a.  The court also declined to \n\n7 \n \ndismiss the action on forum-non-conveniens grounds, \nstating that post-arbitral-award \u201cinvestigations and \nproceedings against [Devas] and its officers and agents \nin India\u2014including both civil and criminal proceed-\nings\u2014raise * * * concerns about the neutrality of pro-\nceedings in India.\u201d  Id. at 15a. \nThe district court subsequently granted Devas\u2019s mo-\ntion to confirm the arbitral award.  Pet. App. 17a-35a.  \nThe court determined that it had subject-matter juris-\ndiction under Section 1330(a) based on the FSIA\u2019s arbi-\ntral exception in Section 1605(a)(6)(B).  Id. at 21a.  The \ncourt further determined that personal jurisdiction \nover respondent existed under Section 1330(b).  Id. at \n22a.\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n17: 20241211211213782_Certificate20-2023-12012024-1720-20CC20Devas20Maritus20Limited.json (score: 0.517)\nNos. 23-1201 and 24-17 \n \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n _________________ \n \nCC/DEVAS (MAURITIUS) LIMITED, ET AL., PETITIONERS \n \nv. \n \nANTRIX CORP.

Subsection (a) of \nthe Act\u2019s provision governing jurisdiction over civil ac-\ntions against foreign states provides that federal dis-\ntrict courts shall have original jurisdiction over claims \ncoming within one of the Act\u2019s exceptions to immunity.  \n28 U.S.C. 1330(a).

Civil litigation against foreign sov-\nereigns in federal and state courts can have significant \nforeign-relations implications for the United States and \ncan affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States \nin the courts of other nations.  The United States thus \nhas a substantial interest in this case. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. This case arises from a contractual dispute be-\ntween petitioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (De-\n\n2 \n \nvas) and respondent Antrix Corp. (respondent).  Devas \nis a private corporation established by a group of Amer-\nican investors and executives under the laws of the Re-\npublic of India.  23-1201 Pet. App. (Pet. App.) 17a, 53a.  \nRespondent\u2014an Indian corporation that markets goods \nand services for the Indian government\u2019s space agencies\n\u2014is wholly owned, and has much of its leadership ap-\npointed, by the Government of India.  Id. at 14a-15a, 53a. \nIn 2005, respondent entered into a contract with De-\nvas (20-36024 C.A. E.R. (E.R.) 246-253) to build, launch, \nand operate two communications satellites, from which \nrespondent would provide Devas with leased communi-\ncations bandwidth that Devas would then use to provide \naudio, video, and information services across India.  Id. \nat 246.  The contract\u2019s mandatory arbitration provision \napplies to \u201cany dispute or difference between the [p]art-\nies\u201d under the contract.  Id. at 251-252.  It provides that \nany resulting arbitral decision or award \u201cshall be final, \nbinding and conclusive on the Parties and entitled to be \nenforced to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and \nentered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at \n252; see Pet. App. 18a (reproducing provision). 0F1 \nIn 2011, respondent terminated the contract.  Pet \nApp. 18a.  Devas then commenced arbitration proceed-\nings under the International Chamber of Commerce \nrules of arbitration.  Id. at 18a-19a.  In 2015, an arbitral \npanel seated in New Delhi, India, found that respondent \nhad \u201cwrongfully repudiated\u201d the contract and entered a \nfinal arbitral award awarding Devas $562.5 million plus \ninterest.  Id. at 20a (citation and brackets omitted); see \nE.R. 54-156 (arbitral award). \n \n1 The contract defines \u201cLaws\u201d to mean \u201call laws, statutes, rules, \nregulations, ordinances, by-laws and other pronouncements having \nthe effect of law of India.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 2-1, at 129 (Sept. 13, 2018). \n\n3 \n \nb. The United States and India are parties to the \nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of \nForeign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), done \nJune 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S. No. 6997.  Both \nnations have agreed under the Convention to recognize \nand enforce arbitral awards concerning \u201ccommercial\u201d \nlegal relationships made \u201cin the territory of [any other] \nContracting State.\u201d  Id. Art. I(3), 21 U.S.T. 2519; see id. \nnote, 21 U.S.T. 2563, 2566.  The Convention provides \nthat, with certain exceptions, each contracting state \n\u201cshall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce \nthem in accordance with the rules of procedure of the \nterritory where the award is relied upon.\u201d  Id. Arts. III \nand V, 21 U.S.T. 2519-2520. \nCongress implemented the New York Convention in \n1970 by directing that the Convention \u201cshall be enforced \nin United States courts in accordance with [9 U.S.C. \n201-208].\u201d  9 U.S.C. 201.  If a party to arbitration timely \napplies for an order confirming an \u201carbitral award fall-\ning under the Convention,\u201d a district court \u201cshall con-\nfirm the award\u201d unless \u201cit finds one of the grounds \n[specified in the Convention] for refusal or deferral of \nrecognition or enforcement of the award.\u201d  9 U.S.C. 207. \n2. In 2018, Devas petitioned the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Washington to \nconfirm the 2015 arbitral award.  20-36024 Intervenors\u2019 \nC.A. Supp. E.R. (Supp. E.R.) 75-90.  Devas argued that \njurisdiction and venue were proper under the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \n1330, 1391(f\u200a), 1441(d), 1602 et seq.  Supp. E.R. 77-78. \na. The FSIA provides \u201cthe sole basis for obtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this \ncountry.\u201d  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434, 443 (1989).  The Act\u2019s def-\n\n4 \n \ninition of \u201c\u200a\u2018foreign state\u2019\u200a\u201d applies \u201c[f\u200a]or purposes of [28 \nU.S.C. 1602-1611]\u201d and where otherwise incorporated \nby reference, as in Section 1330.  28 U.S.C. 1603(a).  \nThat definition includes a foreign state, \u201ca political sub-\ndivision of a foreign state,\u201d and \u201can agency or instru-\nmentality of a foreign state.\u201d  Ibid.  An \u201c\u200a\u2018agency or in-\nstrumentality of a foreign state,\u2019\u200a\u201d in turn, is \u201cany en-\ntity\u201d (1) which is a \u201cseparate legal person, corporate or \notherwise\u201d; (2) \u201cwhich is an organ of a foreign state or \npolitical subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d or \u201ca majority of whose \nshares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign \nstate or political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d; and (3) which is \n\u201cneither a citizen of a State of the United States,\u201d \u201cnor \ncreated under the laws of any third country.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1603(b).  Under the FSIA, a \u201cforeign state\u201d as thus de-\nfined \u201cshall be immune from the jurisdiction\u201d of a fed-\neral or state court in a civil action, unless that action is \nexpressly permitted by certain international agree-\nments or by the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign \nimmunity at 28 U.S.C. 1605-1607.  28 U.S.C. 1604; see \nTurkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. \n264, 272-273 (2023). \nAs relevant here, the FSIA includes an exception to \nforeign sovereign immunity, enacted in 1988, for certain \ncivil actions brought \u201ceither to enforce,\u201d or \u201cto confirm \nan award made pursuant to,\u201d \u201can agreement to arbi-\ntrate\u201d that has been \u201cmade by the foreign state with or \nfor the benefit of a private party\u201d with respect to \u201ca de-\nfined legal relationship\u201d concerning \u201ca subject matter \ncapable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6).  That excep-\ntion applies in four specified contexts, including where \n\u201cthe agreement or award is or may be governed by a \ntreaty or other international agreement in force for the \n\n5 \n \nUnited States calling for the recognition and enforce-\nment of arbitral awards.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6)(B). \nThe FSIA\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d gov-\nerning civil actions against foreign states includes pro-\nvisions addressing, inter alia, federal \u201csubject-matter \njurisdiction,\u201d \u201cpersonal jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cvenue.\u201d  Am-\nerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 & n.3 (citation omitted).  \nFirst, 28 U.S.C. 1330(a) vests federal district courts \nwith \u201coriginal jurisdiction without regard to amount in \ncontroversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign \nstate as defined in [S]ection 1603(a) * * * as to any claim \nfor relief in personam with respect to which the foreign \nstate is not entitled to immunity either under sections \n1605-1607 of [Title 28] or under any applicable interna-\ntional agreement.\u201d  Ibid. \nSecond, 28 U.S.C. 1330(b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal \njurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have juris-\ndiction under [Section 1330](a) where service has been \nmade under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b). \nThird, the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme * * * \naddresses venue,\u2019\u200a\u201d Turkiye Halk Bankasi, 598 U.S. at \n273, by specifying four categories of venue for \u201c[a] civil \naction against a foreign state as defined in [28 U.S.C.] \n1603(a).\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a).  Venue is proper \u201cin any \njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a sub-\nstantial part of property that is the subject of the action \nis situated.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(1).  If the action is \nagainst \u201can agency or instrumentality of a foreign \nstate,\u201d venue is also proper \u201cin any judicial district in \nwhich the agency or instrumentality is licensed to do \nbusiness or is doing business.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(3). \n\n6 \n \nb. Devas alleged that respondent was an \u201cagency or \ninstrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1603(b), \nbut that Devas\u2019s suit fell within Section 1605(a)(6)(B)\u2019s \nexception to sovereign immunity because Devas sought  \nto confirm an award made pursuant to respondent\u2019s ar-\nbitration agreement, which is governed by the New \nYork Convention.  Supp. E.R. 77-78.  Devas alleged that  \nsubject-matter and personal jurisdiction therefore were \nproper under Section 1330(a) and (b).  Id. at 78.  And \nDevas alleged that \u201c[v]enue is proper\u201d in the Western \nDistrict of Washington under the FSIA\u2019s venue provi-\nsion, because respondent \u201cengages in business in th[at] \ndistrict\u201d by contracting with companies having head-\nquarters in the district to sell respondent\u2019s \u201csatellite \nlaunch\u201d and \u201cspace communications services\u201d to cus-\ntomers.  Id. at 77-78. \nRespondent moved to dismiss the petition.  Respond-\nent did not dispute that it is a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the \nFSIA, that service had been properly made, or that the \nFSIA\u2019s arbitral exception applied.  Pet. App. 4a, 21a-\n22a, 54a.  Nor did respondent dispute that it was doing \nbusiness in the district or that venue therein was thus \nproper under Section 1391(f\u200a)(3).  Respondent instead \nargued that the Due Process Clause\u2019s constitutional re-\nquirement for personal jurisdiction requires \u201c\u200a\u2018minimum \ncontacts\u2019 with the United States\u201d but those contacts had \nnot been established.  Id. at 21a-22a; see id. at 13a. \nThe district court denied respondent\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss.  Pet. App. 13a-16a.  The court concluded that \u201cthe \ndue process clause does not apply\u201d on the ground that \n\u201c[respondent] is not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes \nbecause it is effectively controlled by the Government \nof India,\u201d which \u201cexercises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over [re-\nspondent].\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a.  The court also declined to \n\n7 \n \ndismiss the action on forum-non-conveniens grounds, \nstating that post-arbitral-award \u201cinvestigations and \nproceedings against [Devas] and its officers and agents \nin India\u2014including both civil and criminal proceed-\nings\u2014raise * * * concerns about the neutrality of pro-\nceedings in India.\u201d  Id. at 15a. \nThe district court subsequently granted Devas\u2019s mo-\ntion to confirm the arbitral award.  Pet. App. 17a-35a.  \nThe court determined that it had subject-matter juris-\ndiction under Section 1330(a) based on the FSIA\u2019s arbi-\ntral exception in Section 1605(a)(6)(B).  Id. at 21a.  The \ncourt further determined that personal jurisdiction \nover respondent existed under Section 1330(b).  Id. at \n22a.  After reiterating its constitutional due-process rul-\ning, ibid., the court alternatively held that there were \n\u201c\u200a\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 with the United States\u201d satisfying \ndue process because \u201cthe parties\u2019 entire course of dealing\u201d \nshowed that \u201c[r]espondent [had] purposely availed it-\nself of the privilege of conducting business activities in \nthe United States.\u201d  Id. at 22a-25a.  On the merits, the \ncourt found no ground under the New York Convention \nfor refusing to confirm the award.  Id. at 26a-34a.  The \ncourt confirmed the award, id. at 34a, and, in November \n2020, entered a $1.294 billion judgment for Devas, which \nincluded pre- and post-award interest, E.R. 5. \nc. In January 2021, while respondent\u2019s appeal of \nthat judgment was pending, the Government of India, \nin a proceeding initiated by respondent, placed Devas \ninto liquidation and \u201cappoint[ed] a government official\u201d \nto assume control of Devas on the ground that Devas \nhad fraudulently conducted its affairs.  22-35103 C.A. \nE.R. 278-279.  The liquidator promptly fired Devas\u2019s \noriginal counsel in this case.  Id. at 9, 279. \n\n8 \n \nTwo Devas shareholder entities and a United States \nsubsidiary of Devas\u2014the petitioners in No. 23-1201  \n(intervenors)\u2014were then granted leave to intervene in \nthe district court proceedings here.  22-35103 C.A. E.R. \n9, 277, 279, 287.  Following  discovery related to re-\nspondent\u2019s assets, the court authorized intervenors to \nregister the court\u2019s judgment in the Eastern District of \nVirginia, where intervenors had discovered one of re-\nspondent\u2019s debtors, Pet. App. 40a-41a.  Respondent and \nDevas (then, as now, under the liquidator\u2019s control) ap-\npealed that order.  Id. at 55a. \n4. a. The court of appeals consolidated the appeals \nand reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-12a.  The appellate panel \nobserved that \u201c[t]he parties agree that for purposes of \nthe FSIA, [respondent] is a \u2018foreign state,\u2019 service has \nbeen made, and an enumerated exception applies.\u201d  Id. \nat 4a.  But the panel determined that, under binding \nNinth Circuit precedent, \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction under \nthe FSIA requires satisfaction of the traditional mini-\nmum contacts standard\u201d borrowed from due-process ju-\nrisprudence.  Id. at 4a-5a (citation and brackets omit-\nted).  The court emphasized that its \u201capplication of the \nminimum contacts analysis to actions under the FSIA \n* * * is statutory rather than constitutional\u201d and does \nnot reflect a determination that \u201ca foreign state is * * * \na person\u201d for due-process purposes.  Id. at 5a.  The \ncourt explained that its precedent simply reflects a \n\u201creading of the FSIA\u201d that relies on \u201cthe FSIA\u2019s legis-\nlative history\u201d to conclude that \u201cthe FSIA was intended \nto be consistent with the minimum contacts analysis.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThe panel further determined that the district court \nhad erred in alternatively ruling that \u201c[respondent] has \nthe requisite minimum contacts with the United States,\u201d \n\n9 \n \nconcluding that Devas had failed to \u201cshow that [respon-\ndent] purposely availed itself of the privilege of conduct-\ning activities in the United States.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a. \nb. Judge Miller, joined by Judge Koh, concurred.  \nPet. App. 9a-12a.  Judge Miller noted his agreement \nthat the court of appeals\u2019 binding precedent required \napplication of a minimum-contacts analysis as a statu-\ntory rather than a constitutional matter, but he found \nthat precedent to be erroneous because \u201c[n]othing in \n[Section 1330(b)]\u201d supports such \u201ca minimum-contacts re-\nquirement.\u201d  Id. at 9a-10a.  He explained that personal \njurisdiction exists under Section 1330(b)\u2019s \u201ccategorical[]\u201d \ntext where, as here, (1) an FSIA \u201cexception[] to foreign \nsovereign immunity\u201d applies and (2) the foreign state \nhas been \u201cproperly served.\u201d  Id. at 10a (citation omit-\nted).  Judge Miller also noted his agreement with the \nholdings of other courts of appeals that foreign states \ndo not have constitutional due-process rights.  Id. at 9a. \n5. The court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  \nPet. App. 42a-68a.  Judge Bumatay, joined by five active \njudges, dissented.  Id. at 46a-68a.  Judge Bumatay \nstated that the \u201cstraightforward question\u201d in this case \nis whether the FSIA\u2014\u201c[d]espite [its] text\u201d\u2014requires \nproof of \u201c\u200a\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 to assert personal juris-\ndiction over a foreign state.\u201d  Id. at 47a.  He concluded \nthat nothing in Section 1330(b) requires that inquiry.  \nId. at 47a-49a, 57a-62a.  Judge Bumatay further stated \nthat \u201cforeign states\u201d are not entitled to \u201cthe protection \nof minimum contacts under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d  Id. \nat 49a; see id. at 62a-67a.  He emphasized that the only \nquestion before the court of appeals was whether \u201cmin-\nimum contacts\u201d must be proven to \u201cassert personal ju-\nrisdiction over foreign states under the FSIA,\u201d and \nthat, if the court had resolved that question in the neg-\n\n10 \n \native, the case could have been \u201cremanded to the dis-\ntrict court\u201d to decide any \u201cother questions\u201d that would \narise, such as whether respondent, as a \u201ccorporate\u201d en-\ntity, \u201cdeserves due process protection\u201d even if a \u201cfor-\neign state\u201d like India does not.  Id. at 56a & n.1. 1F2 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The court of appeals erred in holding that, as a \nstatutory matter, the FSIA incorporates a \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d standard borrowed from constitutional due-\nprocess jurisprudence to govern personal jurisdiction \nover foreign states. \nA. The FSIA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. \n1330, contains two subsections.  Subsection (a) grants \ndistrict courts subject-matter jurisdiction over civil ac-\ntions against foreign states as to any claim for which an \nexception to foreign sovereign immunity applies under \n28 U.S.C. 1605-1607.  Subsection (b) then provides that \n\u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist \nas to every claim for relief over which the district courts \nhave jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has \nbeen made under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  \nTogether, those provisions supply personal jurisdiction \nover a foreign state whenever (1) an FSIA exception to \nimmunity applies and (2) service has been properly \nmade.  Nothing in that unambiguous text supports a \nfurther statutory minimum-contacts requirement. \nB. The court of appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion, which \nrests on legislative history, is flawed.  First, legislative \nhistory cannot be used to muddy the meaning of the \n \n2  While the case was pending on appeal, an Indian court set aside \nthe arbitration award to Devas.  See Pet. App. 55a.  The courts be-\nlow have not yet passed on the validity of that Indian court order or \nits effect on the merits of Devas\u2019s action. \n\n11 \n \nFSIA\u2019s clear statutory language.  And second, the court \nof appeals misread the pertinent committee report.  \nThat report merely reflects the view that the FSIA\u2019s \noriginal exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity, \nwhich Section 1330(b) incorporates by reference, would \nthemselves apply, as a practical matter, only in contexts \nin which minimum jurisdictional contacts would exist. \nC. Respondent contends (Br. in Opp. 16-17) that \n\u201cmost\u201d of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign \nimmunity in Sections 1605 to 1607 themselves require a \nsufficient \u201cnexus to the United States\u201d to satisfy any \ndue-process requirements.  That is correct.  But the \nconclusion that various FSIA exceptions to immunity \nimpose requirements that by their own terms would sat-\nisfy a due process \u201cminimum contacts\u201d standard pro-\nvides no basis for supplementing the statutory text with \na freestanding non-\u201cstatutory\u201d minimum-contacts re-\nquirement. \nII.  This Court should correct the court of appeals\u2019 \njudgment that the FSIA incorporates a traditional min-\nimum contacts analysis as a statutory matter and re-\nmand for that court to consider in the first instance \nwhether the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due-process require-\nments apply and, if so, whether they have been satisfied.  \nThat disposition would eliminate the division of author-\nity on the statutory question that warranted the Court\u2019s \nreview.  Several reasons also counsel against the Court \naddressing those constitutional questions at this time in \nthis case. \nIII.  A.  If this Court elects to address constitutional \ndue process at this time, the Court should follow its \nprior approach of assuming, without deciding, that a \nforeign state (including an agency or instrumentality \nthereof\u200a) is a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due Process \n\n12 \n \nClause, because, even if due-process principles are ap-\nplicable, personal jurisdiction over respondent is appro-\npriate.  The due-process requirement of personal juris-\ndiction is an individual right that may be waived or for-\nfeited, including through express or implied consent.  \nAnd in this case, respondent consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction by agreeing to a binding arbitration provision \nin its contract with Devas that provides that any arbi-\ntral award shall be entitled to be \u201centered in any court \nof competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Pet. App. 18a.  Federal dis-\ntrict courts are courts of competent jurisdiction, and no \nunfairness results from enforcing that contract accord-\ning to its terms. \nB. 1. If this Court elects to go still further, foreign \nstates themselves are not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  This Court has al-\nready held that States of the Union are not \u201cpersons\u201d \nunder that Clause.  Foreign states have even less of a \nbasis to claim due-process rights.  The word \u201cperson\u201d \nhas not typically been understood to include sovereign \nstates; the relevant drafting history suggests that sov-\nereign states are not protected by the Due Process \nClause; and the absence of any relevant role of foreign \nstates in our constitutional structure, as well as the per-\nfect equality of nation states, confirm that our domestic \nConstitution does not define the rights and duties of the \nUnited States with respect to foreign sovereigns. \n2. The practical implications of conferring due pro-\ncess rights on foreign states would have been signifi-\ncant.  Plenary Legislative and Executive authority is \nparticularly important for the management of disagree-\nments with foreign states.  The Constitution therefore \nleaves to the political Branches the authority to deter-\n\n13 \n \nmine what appropriate process should be followed with \nrespect to foreign states. \n3. It is critically important to the United States\u2019 own \ninterest in securing reciprocal treatment by foreign \nsovereigns, however, that foreign states understand \nthat the United States appropriately safeguards their \ninterests through non-constitutional means, including \nthrough various protections in the FSIA\u2019s comprehen-\nsive and carefully calibrated statutory framework. \nARGUMENT  \nI. THE FSIA DOES NOT REQUIRE A SEPARATE \u201cMINI-\nMUM CONTACTS\u201d ANALYSIS TO ESTABLISH PERSON-\nAL JURISDICTION OVER A FOREIGN STATE \nThe court of appeals held that\u2014as a \u201cstatutory ra-\nther than [a] constitutional\u201d matter\u2014the FSIA provides \nthat \u201c\u200a\u2018[p]ersonal jurisdiction\u2019\u200a\u201d over a foreign state \u201c\u200a\u2018re-\nquires satisfaction of the traditional minimum contacts \nstandard\u2019\u200a\u201d borrowed from constitutional due-process \njurisprudence.  Pet. App. 4a-5a (citation omitted).  That \nis incorrect.  By statute, personal jurisdiction over a for-\neign state exists if (1) a statutory exception exists to for-\neign sovereign immunity and (2) the foreign state has \nbeen served with process under 28 U.S.C. 1608.  See 28 \nU.S.C. 1330(a) and (b).  And because \u201c[t]he parties \nagree that for purposes of the FSIA, [respondent] is a \n\u2018foreign state,\u2019 service has been made, and an enumer-\nated exception [to immunity] applies,\u201d Pet. App. 4a, the \nFSIA\u2019s statutory prerequisites to personal jurisdiction \nhave been satisfied.  That straightforward conclusion is \nall that this Court need resolve in this case. \n\n14 \n \nA. Personal Jurisdiction Exists Where An FSIA Exception \nTo Immunity Applies And Proper Service Is Made \nThe FSIA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. 1330, \nhas two subsections addressing, respectively, subject-\nmatter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.  Together, \nthose provisions unambiguously specify that personal \njurisdiction exists over a foreign state under the FSIA \nif, as is undisputed here (Pet. App. 4a), an FSIA excep-\ntion to foreign sovereign immunity applies and the for-\neign state has been properly served. \nFirst, Subsection (a) grants district courts \u201coriginal \njurisdiction\u201d over \u201cany nonjury civil action against a for-\neign state as defined in [S]ection 1603(a)\u201d as to \u201cany \nclaim for relief in personam with respect to which the \nforeign state is not entitled to immunity either under \n[28 U.S.C.] 1605-1607\u201d or \u201cunder any applicable inter-\nnational agreement.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(a).  That \u201cunam-\nbiguous\u201d language confers federal \u201csubject-matter ju-\nrisdiction\u201d over any such action if \u201cone of the [FSIA\u2019s] \nspecified exceptions to [foreign] sovereign immunity \napplies.\u201d  Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, \n461 U.S. 480, 489 (1983); see id. at 493-494 & n.20.  That \naffirmative grant of jurisdiction \u201cwork[s] in tandem\u201d \nwith 28 U.S.C. 1604, which \u201cbars federal and state \ncourts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state \nis entitled to immunity,\u201d i.e., when no exception to im-\nmunity applies.  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess \nShipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434 (1989). \nSecond, Subsection (b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal ju-\nrisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have juris-\ndiction under subsection (a) where service has been \nmade under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  The \nfirst half of that subsection\u2014which expressly limits \n\n15 \n \npersonal jurisdiction to those claims for which \u201cjurisdic-\ntion [exists] under subsection (a),\u201d ibid.\u2014ensures that \n\u201cpersonal jurisdiction, like subject-matter jurisdiction, \nexists only when one of the exceptions to foreign sover-\neign immunity in [Sections] 1605-1607 applies.\u201d  Amera-\nda Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 n.3.  \u201cThus, if none of the ex-\nceptions to sovereign immunity set forth in the Act ap-\nplies, the District Court lacks both statutory subject-\nmatter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.\u201d  Verlin-\nden, 461 U.S. at 485 n.5. \nThe second half of Subsection (b) further requires \nthat \u201cservice [must be] made under [S]ection 1608\u201d to \nestablish \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction\u201d over a foreign state.  \n28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  Section 1608, in turn, specifies the \nFSIA\u2019s hierarchy of statutorily required methods for \nserving a foreign state.  28 U.S.C. 1608(a) and (b); see \nRepublic of Sudan v. Harrison, 587 U.S. 1, 4-5, 8-13 \n(2019). \nIt follows that Section 1330(b) \u201cmakes personal ju-\nrisdiction over a foreign state automatic when [1] an ex-\nception to immunity applies and [2] service of process \nhas been [properly] accomplished.\u201d  Samatar v. Yousuf, \n560 U.S. 305, 324 n.20 (2010).  Nothing in the FSIA\u2019s \nunambiguous text permits the imposition of any further \nstatutory prerequisite to personal jurisdiction, much \nless a type of \u201cminimum contacts analysis\u201d borrowed \nfrom due-process jurisprudence that the court of ap-\npeals imposed as a \u201cstatutory rather than [a] constitu-\ntional\u201d matter, Pet. App. 4a-5a. \nB. The FSIA\u2019s Legislative History Provides No Basis For \nAn Independent \u201cMinimum Contacts\u201d Requirement \nThe court of appeals determined that its contrary \nprecedent rests on \u201ca reading of the FSIA\u2019s legislative \nhistory\u201d suggesting that Congress intended the FSIA \n\n16 \n \nto be \u201cconsistent with the minimum contacts analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 5a.  That reliance on legislative history is \ndeeply flawed for two reasons. \nFirst, as the foregoing discussion has shown, nothing \nin the FSIA\u2019s unambiguous text imposes any separate, \nfreestanding requirement of \u201cminimum contacts\u201d be-\ntween a foreign state and the United States as a predi-\ncate for personal jurisdiction over the foreign state.  \nThat should end the interpretive inquiry.  \u201cEven those \n[Members of the Court] who sometimes consult legisla-\ntive history will never allow it to be used,\u201d as here, \u201cto \n\u2018muddy\u2019 the meaning of \u2018clear statutory language.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nFood Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. 427, \n436 (2019) (citation omitted). \nSecond, as Judge Bumatay recognized, the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s precedent simply misreads the legislative his-\ntory.  Pet. App. 48a, 60a-62a.  The relevant House of \nRepresentatives committee report that the precedent \ninvokes does not contemplate a freestanding \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d analysis that supplements the inquiries ex-\npressly specified in FSIA\u2019s text.  The report simply re-\nflects the view that the exceptions to immunity enacted \nin 1976 applied, as a practical matter, only in contexts \nin which the committee believed \u201cminimum jurisdic-\ntional contacts\u201d would exist. \nThe committee report states that Section 1330(b) \n\u201cembodie[s]\u201d the \u201cdue process requirement\u201d of \u201cmini-\nmum jurisdictional contacts\u201d because it \u201cincorporat[es] \nthese jurisdictional contacts by reference.\u201d  H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1976) (emphasis \nadded).  More specifically, the report states that Section \n1330(b) provides for personal jurisdiction only if there \nis \u201coriginal jurisdiction under section 1330(a)\u201d; that ju-\nrisdiction under Section 1330(a) exists only where the \n\n17 \n \nunderlying \u201cclaim [is one] for which the foreign state is \nnot entitled to immunity\u201d; and that, \u201c[s]ignificantly, \neach of the immunity provisions in the bill, [S]ections \n1605-1607, * * * prescribe[s] the necessary contacts \nwhich must exist before our courts can exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d by requiring either \u201csome connection \nbetween the lawsuit and the United States[] or an ex-\npress or implied waiver\u201d of immunity.  Ibid. (emphasis \nadded); accord S. Rep. No. 1310, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 \n(1976).  The report thus reflects the view that the \nFSIA\u2019s original exceptions to foreign sovereign immun-\nity, which Section 1330(b) incorporates by reference, \ngenerally apply in circumstances that would constitute \nminimum contacts under a due-process analysis.  The \nreport \u201csays nothing about a minimum-contacts analy-\nsis over and above satisfying a statutory exception\u201d in \nSections 1605-1607.  Pet. App. 61a-62a (Bumatay, J., \ndissenting).  Had Congress intended to impose a re-\nquirement for a separate minimum-contacts analysis, it \nwould have enacted text to that effect. \nC. The FSIA\u2019s Exceptions To Foreign Sovereign Immunity \nDo Not Impose An Independent Statutory \u201cMinimum \nContacts\u201d Requirement \n1. The Court\u2019s minimum-contacts jurisprudence has \ndeveloped under the Fourteenth Amendment, which \nprohibits \u201cany State\u201d from \u201cdepriv[ing] any person of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Under this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions, if a defendant is a \u201cperson\u201d having such rights, \nibid, the Fourteenth Amendment permits \u201ca State [to] \nauthorize its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction \nover an out-of-state defendant\u201d where \u201cthe defendant \nhas \u2018certain minimum contacts with [the State] such \nthat the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018tradi-\n\n18 \n \ntional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 \nU.S. 915, 923 (2011) (quoting International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)) (brackets in orig-\ninal).  That restriction on \u201cstate [judicial] power\u201d is \ngrounded in an \u201c\u200a\u2018individual liberty interest\u2019\u200a\u201d protected \nby the Due Process Clause, Burger King Corp. v. \nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471-472 & n.13 (1985) (citation \nomitted), although it also reflects the territorial \u201climits\u201d \nof each individual State\u2019s authority within our \u201cfederal \nsystem,\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, \n444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980). \nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s limit on personal ju-\nrisdiction often applies indirectly in civil actions in fed-\neral court because, by rule, service of a summons \u201ces-\ntablishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant\u201d who \nwould be \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of a court of gen-\neral jurisdiction in the [S]tate where the district court \nis located,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A).  See Daimler AG \nv. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014).  The same rule, \nhowever, also provides that such service will, in addi-\ntion, confer personal jurisdiction over a defendant \nwhenever (1) \u201cauthorized by a federal statute\u201d or (2) the \nunderlying claim \u201carises under federal law\u201d and the ex-\nercise of \u201cjurisdiction is consistent with the United \nStates Constitution and laws.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(C) \nand (2). \nA plurality of the Court has recognized that \u201ca de-\nfendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction \nof the courts of the United States but not of any partic-\nular State.\u201d  J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, 884 (2011).  But the Court has reserved the \n\u201cquestion whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the \nsame [type of\u200a] restrictions\u201d as the Fourteenth Amend-\n\n19 \n \nment regarding \u201cthe exercise of personal jurisdiction by \na federal court.\u201d  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior \nCt., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); see, e.g., Omni Capital \nInt\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 102 n.5 \n(1987).  Cf. Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdic-\ntion of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1704-\n1710 (2020) (rejecting national-minimum-contacts rule \napplied by the courts of appeals as incorrect; arguing \nthat Congress may authorize federal courts to exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over any defendant if the author-\nizing legislation falls within Congress\u2019s enumerated \npowers). \n2. Invoking Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, \nrespondent argues (Br. in Opp. 16-17) that \u201cmost\u201d of the \nFSIA\u2019s substantive exceptions to foreign sovereign im-\nmunity in Sections 1605 to 1607 require a sufficient \n\u201cnexus to the United States\u201d to satisfy any due-process \nrequirements.  We agree.  Cf. Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490 \n(noting that Congress enacted \u201csubstantive provisions \nrequiring some form of substantial contact with the \nUnited States\u201d in Section 1605\u2019s original 1976 excep-\ntions to immunity). 2F3  But the conclusion that exceptions \n \n3 \u201cUnder the original [1976] FSIA, * * * it was generally under-\nstood that in order for immunity to be lost, there had to be some \ntangible connection between the conduct of the foreign defendant \nand the territory of the United States.\u201d  Price v. Socialist People's \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 89 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Thus, \nalthough one original exception rested on a foreign state\u2019s explicit \nor implicit \u201cwaive[r]\u201d of its immunity, 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(1), the \u201cnor-\nmal pattern of the Act\u201d was to \u201crequir[e] some form of contact with \nthe United States\u201d as a condition for lifting immunity.  Verlinden, \n461 U.S. at 490 n.15; see 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2) (\u201ccommercial activity\u201d \nexception requiring, at a minimum, a \u201cdirect effect in the United \nStates\u201d), (3) (expropriation exception requiring that expropriated \nproperty or property exchanged therefor is either \u201cpresent in the \n \n\n20 \n \nto immunity include text imposing requirements that by \ntheir own terms would satisfy a due process \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d requirement does not provide license to sup-\nplement the statutory text with a freestanding non-\n\u201cstatutory\u201d minimum-contacts requirement. \nII. THIS COURT SHOULD REMAND FOR THE COURT OF \nAPPEALS TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OF CONSTI-\nTUTIONAL DUE PROCESS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE \nThis Court need not go further than deciding that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that the FSIA incor-\nporates \u201ca traditional minimum contacts analysis\u201d as a \n\u201cstatutory\u201d matter.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  Correcting that \nerror will eliminate the division of authority on the stat-\nutory question that warranted this Court\u2019s review.  See \nid. at 59a (Bumatay, J., dissenting) (noting that con-\nflict).  Moreover, the United States agrees with re-\nspondent and Devas that \u201c[t]he Court should not rush \nto take up th[e] [additional] question\u201d of whether\u2014as a \n\u201cconstitutional\u201d matter\u2014a foreign state enjoys due-\nprocess protections that may limit personal jurisdiction.  \nBr. in Opp. 20; see Devas Br. 18, 34.  The Court should \ninstead remand to allow the court of appeals to resolve \nany relevant constitutional contentions in the first in-\nstance. \nThe court of appeals emphasized that its \u201cstatutory\u201d \nholding did not resolve \u201cif a foreign state is [or is] not a \nperson\u201d that would be \u201centitled to a minimum contacts \n \nUnited States\u201d or owned or operated by a foreign state\u2019s agency or \ninstrumentality \u201cengaged in a commercial activity in the United \nStates\u201d), (4) (exception for cases involving rights in either \u201cproperty \nin the United States\u201d acquired by gift or succession or \u201cimmovable \nproperty situated in the United States\u201d), and (5) (exception for tor-\ntious personal injury, death, or property damage or loss \u201coccurring \nin the United States\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nanalysis through the Constitution.\u201d  Pet. App. 5a.  And \nalthough two members of the panel expressed the view \nthat a \u201cforeign state[]\u201d is not a \u201c\u200a\u2018person\u2019\u200a\u201d entitled to \ndue-process rights under the Fifth Amendment, id. at \n9a (Miller, J., concurring), that observation was not the \nbasis for the court\u2019s judgment, which rested on the de-\ntermination that personal jurisdiction was lacking be-\ncause statutorily required \u201cminimum contacts with the \nUnited States\u201d had not been established, id. at 6a-8a.  \nThe panel, and the full court if appropriate, should be \ngiven the opportunity in the first instance to address any \nFifth Amendment constraints before this Court consid-\ners the question itself.  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. \n709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not of \nfirst view.\u201d). \nSeveral other reasons also counsel against address-\ning that constitutional question in this case at this time.  \nFirst, this Court has thus far refrained from resolving \nwhether or to what extent the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s limits on the exercise of state-court personal ju-\nrisdiction should apply under the Fifth Amendment in \nfederal court.  See pp. 18-19, supra.4  Second, in this \ncase, Congress, in the exercise of its commerce and for-\neign affairs powers, made a judgment\u2014both in the \nFSIA and in the statute implementing the New York \nConvention\u2014concerning categories of cases that may \nproperly be heard in the courts of the United States.  \nThat judgment warrants respect in addressing due pro-\n \n4 This Court recently granted certiorari to review a Second Cir-\ncuit decision holding unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment \nan Act of Congress that provides for personal jurisdiction over spec-\nified foreign entities for acts of terrorism abroad.  Fuld v. Palestine \nLiberation Org., 82 F.4th 74 (2023), cert. granted, Nos. 24-20, 24-\n151 (Dec. 6, 2024). \n\n22 \n \ncess in this setting, which is distinct from the cases in \nwhich the Court has analyzed limitations on the powers \nof States and state courts under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Third, the Court has not resolved whether \n\u201ca foreign state is a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due \nProcess Clause,\u201d Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, \nInc., 504 U.S. 607, 619 (1992) (\u201c[a]ssuming, without de-\nciding,\u201d that issue), and this Court\u2019s resolution of that \nquestion could have significant implications for the \nUnited States\u2019 exercise of its foreign affairs power.  \nFourth, this case does not even involve a foreign state \nitself as a party; respondent is a corporation with a legal \nidentity distinct from India.  The question whether such \nan \u201cagency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 1603(b), has due process rights even if the for-\neign state itself does not is a further question that has \nnot been resolved below.  Cf. Pet. App. 56a & n.1 (Buma-\ntay, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the district court \ncould resolve that question after appellate resolution of \n\u201cthe sole question\u201d before the court concerning \u201cper-\nsonal jurisdiction over foreign states\u201d). 3F5  These are \nweighty issues that this Court should address only \nwhere necessary and only in a case in which a court of \nappeals has already resolved them, fully articulated its \nrelevant reasoning, and applied its legal holdings to the \nfacts of the case in a manner that would facilitate this \nCourt\u2019s plenary review. \n \n5 Some courts of appeals have determined that foreign-state agen-\ncies or instrumentalities possess due-process rights even though \nforeign states do not.  See, e.g., GSS Grp. Ltd. v. National Port \nAuth., 680 F.3d 805, 809, 814-815 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  The rationale \nunderlying those decisions has, however, been called into question.  \nId. at 817-819 (Williams, J., joined by Randolph, J., concurring). \n\n23 \n \nIII. PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER A FOREIGN STATE \nIN THIS ARBITRATION CONTEXT IS CONSISTENT \nWITH CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS \nEven if due-process principles are applicable in this \ncontext, personal jurisdiction over respondent is appro-\npriate based on respondent\u2019s arbitration agreement.  If \nthis Court elects to address constitutional due process \nat this time, therefore, the Court should follow its prior \napproach of \u201c[a]ssuming, without deciding, that a for-\neign state\u201d\u2014including an agency or instrumentality \nthereof\u2014\u201cis a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due Process \nClause,\u201d Weltover, 504 U.S. at 619, and should find any \ndue-process requirement satisfied.  If the Court elects \nto rule more broadly, however, it should hold that for-\neign states themselves are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \ndue-process protection under the Fifth Amendment. \nA. Respondent Consented To Personal Jurisdiction In Its \nContract With Devas \nThe due-process \u201crequirement of personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d is an \u201cindividual right\u201d and a personal defense that \nmay be waived or forfeited.  Insurance Corp. of Ireland \nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n703-705 (1982); see Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry., 600 U.S. \n122, 144 (2023) (plurality opinion).  And where a defend-\nant\u2019s actions are fairly understood to \u201camount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court, whether vol-\nuntary or not,\u201d personal jurisdiction exists over that de-\nfendant.  Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 704-705.  As a \nresult, a \u201c\u200a\u2018variety of legal arrangements [have been taken \nto] represent express or implied consent\u2019 to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d of the court, including \u201csigning a contract \nwith a forum selection clause.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n145-146 & n.10 (plurality opinion) (quoting dissenting \nopinion, which quotes Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 703); \n\n24 \n \nsee id. at 167 (Barrett, J., dissenting).  Respondent\u2019s \ncontract with Devas is such an arrangement.  Under \nthat contract, respondent consented to personal juris-\ndiction in district court arbitral-award-enforcement pro-\nceedings. \n\u201cArbitration,\u201d of course, \u201cis strictly \u2018a matter of con-\nsent.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Granite Rock Co. v. International Bhd. of \nTeamsters, 561 U.S. 287, 299 (2010) (citation omitted).  \nUnder the FSIA, disputes about the formation of an ar-\nbitration agreement are jurisdictional because an \nagreement to arbitrate is a factual predicate for the \nAct\u2019s arbitral exception to a foreign state\u2019s jurisdic-\ntional immunity from suit.  28 U.S.C. 1604, 1605(a)(6); \nsee LLC SPC Stileks v. Republic of Moldova, 985 F.3d \n871, 877 (D.C. Cir. 2021).  But where, as here, there is \nno dispute that the parties consented to arbitrate, \n\u201cagreements to arbitrate are enforced according to \ntheir terms.\u201d  Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Board of Trs. of \nLeland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 479 (1989). \nHere, respondent consented to personal jurisdiction \nin this case by explicitly agreeing that any resulting ar-\nbitral award shall be binding and conclusive and shall \nbe entitled to be \u201centered in any court of competent ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d Pet. App. 18a (quoting the contract) (em-\nphasis added).  Federal district courts are clearly courts \nof competent jurisdiction by virtue of the New York \nConvention, to which both India and the United States \nare parties; Congress\u2019s implementing legislation, which \ngrants district courts jurisdiction over proceedings fall-\ning under the Convention, 9 U.S.C. 203; and the FSIA\u2019s \narbitral exception to the jurisdictional immunity of for-\neign states, 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6). \nNo unfairness results from enforcing respondent\u2019s \ncontract according to its terms.  Respondent is a sophis-\n\n25 \n \nticated entity that engages in complex commercial \ntransactions.  And if respondent had desired to limit en-\nforcement of any arbitral award resulting from that \ncontract to the courts of, for instance, the Republic of \nIndia, it could have readily done so by insisting on a \nmore circumscribed arbitral-award provision. \nThis Court in C&L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band \nPotawatomi Indian Tribe, 532 U.S. 411 (2001), unani-\nmously upheld the enforcement of an arbitral award un-\nder analogous circumstances involving tribal sovereign \nimmunity.  The Tribe in C&L Enterprises had entered \ninto a commercial contract containing an arbitration \nprovision in which the Tribe expressly agreed to the \n\u201cenforcement of [resulting] arbitral awards \u2018in any \ncourt having jurisdiction thereof.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 414-415.  The \ncontract also identified preexisting arbitration rules to \ngovern the arbitral proceedings, and those rules simi-\nlarly provided that \u201c\u200a\u2018the arbitration award may be en-\ntered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction \nthereof.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 419 (citation omitted).  Oklahoma law \nvested jurisdiction to enforce such arbitration agree-\nments in \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction of th[e] \nstate.\u201d  Id. at 419-420 (citation omitted).  Under those \ncircumstances, the Court held that, through the con-\ntract\u2019s arbitration provision, \u201cthe Tribe clearly con-\nsented to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral \nawards in Oklahoma state court,\u201d and thereby waived \nits sovereign immunity from such a suit.  Id. at 418, 423 \n(citation omitted). \nIn this case, the FSIA itself displaced respondent\u2019s \nforeign sovereign immunity from suit.  But like the \nTribe in C&L Enterprises, respondent entered into a \ncontract expressly permitting entry of arbitral awards \nin any court of competent jurisdiction, and thereby \n\n26 \n \n\u201cconsented to * * * enforcement of arbitral awards in \n[federal district] court.\u201d  532 U.S. at 423.  That consent \nwould fully support personal jurisdiction over respond-\nent here, assuming arguendo that the Due Process \nClause applies. \nB. A Foreign State Is Not A \u201cPerson\u201d Entitled To Fifth \nAmendment Due-Process Rights \nThe district court determined that respondent is, in \neffect, a foreign state\u2014and therefore \u201cis not a \u2018person\u2019 \nfor due process purposes\u201d\u2014because the Government of \nIndia wholly owns, finances the activities of, and \u201cexer-\ncises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over [respondent],\u201d which is \n\u201c\u200a\u2018housed\u2019\u200a\u201d within Indian government agencies \u201c\u200a\u2018for the \npurposes of staffing, premises and all organizational \nsupport.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 13a-15a (citations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals did not address that determination.  Pe-\ntitioners nevertheless renew (Intervenors Br. 30-34; \nDevas Br. 35-38) their argument that foreign states do \nnot possess due-process rights.  If this Court addresses \nthat argument, it is the position of the United States \nthat a foreign state is not entitled to protection under \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  That \nClause provides: \u201cnor shall any person * * * be deprived \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. Amend. V.  The Fifth Amendment\u2019s text, \nthe broader constitutional structure, and the relevant \ndrafting history demonstrate that a foreign state is not \na \u201cperson\u201d under that Clause.  We do not, however, take \na position at this juncture on the ultimate application of \nthe Due Process Clause to an agency or instrumentality \nof a foreign state.  See p. 22 & n.5, supra. \n1. The Framers would not have understood the word \n\u201cperson\u201d in this context to include a foreign state.  To  \n \n\n27 \n \nbe sure, as a purely linguistic matter, \u201cperson\u201d could be \nused in some contexts to refer to a sovereign state.  See, \ne.g., Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 455-456 \n(1793) (opinion of Wilson, J.) (describing \u201ca State\u201d of the \nUnion as \u201can artificial person\u201d); id. at 472 (opinion of \nJay, C.J.) (stating that \u201ca nation or State-sovereign is \nthe person or persons in whom [sovereignty] resides\u201d); \nsee also Ingrid Wuerth, The Due Process and Other \nConstitutional Rights of Foreign Nations, 88 Fordham \nL. Rev. 633, 676-679 (2019).  But see Donald Earl Chil-\ndress III, Novel Perspectives on Due Process Sympo-\nsium: Questioning the Constitutional Rights of Na-\ntions, 88 Fordham L. Rev. Online 60, 63-73 (2019) (dis-\nputing Professor Wureth\u2019s analysis). \nBut the word \u201c\u200a\u2018person\u2019\u200a\u201d in \u201ccommon usage\u201d has not \ntypically \u201cinclude[d] the sovereign\u201d and, for that rea-\nson, \u201cstatutes employing the phrase [have been] ordi-\nnarily\u201d though not always \u201cconstrued to exclude it.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604-605 \n(1941); see Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United \nStates ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 780-781 (2000).  The \nspecific context at issue, including legal history and \nstructural considerations, rather than just the \u201cliteral \ntext\u201d alone, is therefore important.  See Alden v. Maine, \n527 U.S. 706, 719-720 (1999) (interpreting Eleventh \nAmendment); Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. at 605 (emphasiz-\ning that \u201csubject matter\u201d and \u201ccontext\u201d inform the \nproper interpretation). \nThe context here provides a clear answer.  This \nCourt has already held that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the \ncontext of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\nment cannot, by any reasonable mode of interpretation, \nbe expanded to encompass the States of the Union.\u201d  \nSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323 (1966).  \n\n28 \n \nAnd foreign states have even less of a basis than States \nto claim due-process rights. \nThe \u201c\u200a\u2018constitutional structure\u2019\u200a\u201d and the lack of any \nrelevant role of foreign states \u201cin the constitutional \nplan\u201d is significant.  See PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New \nJersey, 594 U.S. 482, 505-506 (2021) (citation omitted).  \nUnlike States and the United States itself, \u201c[t]he for-\neign State lies outside the structure of the Union.\u201d  \nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, \n330 (1934).  Foreign states, unlike the States, have ac-\ncepted \u201cno general obligation to abide by the constitu-\ntional norms.\u201d  Lori Fisler Damrosch, Foreign States \nand the Constitution, 73 Va. L. Rev. 483, 522 (1987).  \n\u201c[N]or are there any effective means to place [them] on \nparity with the United States or the [S]tates for pur-\nposes of enforcement of particular norms.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nbecause a foreign state\u2019s reciprocal treatment of the \nUnited States is neither prescribed in our domestic \ncharter nor could be guaranteed if it were, the Framers \nwould have had no reason to impose constitutional lim-\nits on the United States\u2019 own authority to deal with for-\neign states\u2014limits which would have been effectively \nunalterable by the political Branches vested with our \nNation\u2019s national-security and foreign-affairs authority. \nFurthermore, the United States\u2019 \u201cpowers of external \nsovereignty,\u201d including the power to determine \u201cdiplo-\nmatic relations\u201d with foreign states, are \u201cnecessary con-\ncomitants of nationality\u201d embodied in \u201cthe law of na-\ntions,\u201d which do \u201cnot depend upon affirmative grants of \nthe Constitution.\u201d  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-\nport Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936).  The Constitution \nmerely distributes that inherent authority among the \npolitical Branches.  And \u201c[a]s a member of the family of \nnations, the right and power of the United States in that \n\n29 \n \nfield are equal to the right and power of the other mem-\nbers of the international family.\u201d  Ibid.  This Court thus \nrecognized early in our Nation\u2019s history that sovereign \nnations \u201cpossess[] equal rights and equal independ-\nence\u201d on the world stage, emphasizing that this \u201cperfect \nequality and absolute independence\u201d mean that \u201c[o]ne \nsovereign [is] in no respect amenable to another.\u201d  The \nSchooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) \n116, 136-137 (1812).  The fact that \u201cno sovereign is \u2018ame-\nnable,\u2019 or subject to the other,\u201d means that \u201c\u200a\u2018the rights \nand duties of the United States and foreign sovereign-\nties vis-a-vis one another derive not from the domestic \nlaw of either, but from the mutual agreements contained \nin treaties and the consensus known as customary in-\nternational law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Constitutionality of Closing the Pal-\nestine Information Office, 11 Op. OLC 104, 107 (1987) \n(citation omitted).  In the context of actions authorized \nand taken by the political Branches against foreign \nstates, the United States\u2019 position has thus been that \n\u201cforeign states,\u201d unlike foreign nationals physically pre-\nsent in United States territory, \u201chave no constitutional \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 107 n.2. \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s drafting history, though \nsparse, also reflects that foreign states do not have con-\nstitutional due-process rights.  In 1215, Magna Carta \ngranted rights to each \u201cFreeman\u201d in England similar to \nthe right to life, liberty, and property later safeguarded \nby the Due Process Clause.  Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. \nv. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 28 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in \nthe judgment) (citation omitted).  By 1354, a statute of \nKing Edward III, which appears merely to restate \nthose protections, had substituted \u201cdue process of the \nlaw\u201d for the original \u201cthe Law of the Land.\u201d  See ibid. \n(citations omitted).  Sir Edward Coke, with whom \u201c[t]he \n\n30 \n \nAmerican Colonists were intimately familiar,\u201d thus de-\ntermined that \u201cthe phrase \u2018due process of law\u2019 referred \nto the customary procedures to which freemen were en-\ntitled by \u2018the old law of England.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 28-29 (citation \nomitted).  This Court later agreed, concluding that the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s use of \u201cthe words \u2018due process of \nlaw\u2019 conveyed \u2018the same meaning as the words \u201cby the \nlaw of the land,\u201d in Magna Charta.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29 (quoting \nMurray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., \n59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 276 (1856)); see Kerry v. Din, 576 \nU.S. 86, 91 (2015) (plurality opinion). \nSignificantly, the rights of \u201cfreemen\u201d throughout \nMagna Carta were rights granted to \u201cthe freemen of \nour realm,\u201d i.e., of England.  Magna Carta ch. 1 (1215) \n(emphasis added).  Due-process antecedents in state \nconstitutions likewise granted such rights to either \n\u201cfreem[e]n\u201d or \u201csubject[s].\u201d  Haslip, 499 U.S. at 29 (ci-\ntations omitted).  The proposed text of the Fifth Amend-\nment paralleled that language, initially providing due-\nprocess rights to any \u201cFreeman\u201d before the term was \nchanged to \u201cperson.\u201d  Max Crema et al., The Original \nMeaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amend-\nment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 508 & n.257 (2022).  The rec-\nords of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s ratification, however, \ncontain no \u201ccomment on [the Due Process] Clause.\u201d  Id. \nat 507. \n2. The practical implications of conferring due pro-\ncess rights on foreign states would have been signifi-\ncant.  In our system of separated federal powers, the \npolitical Branches exercise \u201cauthority over the Nation\u2019s \nforeign relations,\u201d \u201ca domain in which the[ir] controlling \nrole * * * is both necessary and proper.\u201d  Bank Markazi \nv. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 234-235 (2016).  Indeed, this \nCourt has repeatedly concluded that \u201cmatters relating \n\n31 \n \n\u2018to the conduct of foreign relations . . . are so exclusively \nentrusted to the political branches of government as to \nbe largely immune from judicial inquiry or interfer-\nence.\u201d  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Hernandez v. Mesa, 589 U.S. 93, 104 \n(2020); Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 243 (1984). \nThat Legislative and Executive authority is particu-\nlarly critical for the management of disagreements with \nforeign states.  For example, \u201c[i]n furtherance of their \nauthority over the Nation\u2019s foreign relations, Congress \nand the President have, time and again, as exigencies \narose, exercised control over claims against foreign \nstates and the disposition of foreign-state property in \nthe United States\u201d by, for instance, \u201cblocking [foreign-\nstate assets] or governing their availability for attach-\nment.\u201d  Bank Markazi, 578 U.S. at 235.  Such actions \ncan provide the President an important \u201c\u200a\u2018bargaining \nchip\u2019\u200a\u201d to use when \u201cnegotiating the resolution\u201d of con-\nflicts with hostile states.  Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 \nU.S. 654, 673 (1981).  See, e.g., International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; Trading \nwith the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  Congress \nalso amended the FSIA in 2008 to withdraw the immun-\nity of any foreign state that the Executive Branch has \ndesignated as \u201ca state sponsor of terrorism\u201d from \nclaims based on acts of terrorism that injure or kill \nAmericans, United States military personnel, or United \nStates government employees or contractors anywhere \nin the world.  28 U.S.C. 1605A(a)(1), (2)(A)(i)-(ii), (c), \nand (h)(6).  The exercise of such authority by the politi-\ncal Branches with respect to foreign states should not \nbe constrained, much less undermined, by a foreign \nstate\u2019s claims of constitutionally insufficient process. \n\n32 \n \nThe Constitution instead leaves it to the political \nBranches to determine what appropriate process should \nbe followed with respect to foreign states.  Those deci-\nsions are properly influenced by principles of comity \nand reciprocity as well as the framework of interna-\ntional law. \n3. At the same time, it is critically important to the \nUnited States\u2019 own interest in securing reciprocal treat-\nment by foreign sovereigns that foreign states under-\nstand that the United States appropriately safeguards \ntheir interests through non-constitutional means. \nFor example, although \u201cforeign sovereign immunity \nis a matter of grace and comity on the part of the United \nStates,\u201d the FSIA confirms the immunity of foreign \nstates by default and generally adheres to the restric-\ntive theory of sovereign immunity by providing tailored \nexceptions that typically permit suit against foreign \nstates based on claims involving \u201csome form of substan-\ntial contact with the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 486, 490 & n.15.  The FSIA then supplements \nthose circumscribed exceptions within a \u201ccomprehen-\nsive statutory scheme\u201d for civil actions against foreign \nstates by addressing significant procedural matters \nsuch as the proper method of service to provide the for-\neign state adequate notice, the foreign state\u2019s right of \n\u201cremoval,\u201d and appropriate \u201cvenue[s]\u201d for such actions.  \nAmerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 n.3; see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \n1391(f\u200a), 1441(d), 1608.  The \u201cvenue provisions\u201d set forth \nin the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme,\u201d Turkiye \nHalk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. 264, 273 \n(2023), for instance, logically provide for venue in the \ndistrict where \u201ca substantial part\u201d of the conduct under-\nlying a claim occurred or where a \u201csubstantial part of \nproperty\u201d at issue is situated.  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(1).  \n\n33 \n \nVenue for actions \u201cagainst a foreign state\u201d itself or a \n\u201cpolitical subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d is also proper in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(4), \u201cwhere it may \nbe easiest for [it] to defend\u201d and where many \u201chave dip-\nlomatic representatives.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1310, 94th Cong., \n2d Sess. 31 (1976).  And in an action against \u201can agency \nor instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d the FSIA also \nprovides for venue in a district in which the agency or \ninstrumentality is \u201clicensed to do business or is doing \nbusiness.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(3). 4F6 \nOf course, if a foreign state is made a party to federal \nlitigation, it is entitled to a fair adjudicatory process.  \nEven before the Fifth Amendment was ratified, it was \nunderstood that the Constitution\u2019s grant of federal \u201cju-\ndicial Power,\u201d U.S. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 1, did not permit \nfederal courts to exercise \u201carbitrary\u201d power over liti-\ngants and, instead, required the impartial adjudicatory \napplication of \u201crules and precedents\u201d that \u201cdefine and \npoint out [the judge\u2019s] duty in every particular case.\u201d  \n \n6 In 2011, Congress enacted 1391(b)\u2019s three \u201c[g]eneral\u201d venue pro-\nvisions.  28 U.S.C. 1391(b) (capitalization altered).  The text of one \nof those provisions is materially identical to the FSIA\u2019s first venue \nprovision.  See 28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(2) and (f\u200a)(1).  The last of the three \ngeneral provisions is a catchall, providing that venue is proper in \n\u201cany judicial district\u201d in which there is \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d over \na defendant if no district exists in which the action may otherwise \nbe brought \u201cas provided in this section.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(3).  Cf. \n28 U.S.C. 1330(b) (conferring personal jurisdiction over foreign \nstates without regard to venue\u2019s location).  The government argued \nin one case that Section 1391(b)(3) applies to FSIA actions, but the \ncourt did not reach that contention.  See Corporacion Mexicana de \nMantenimiento Integral v. Pemex-Exploracion y Produccion, 832 \nF.3d 92, 104 (2d Cir. 2016); cf. 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3803, at 48 & n.9 (4th ed. 2013) (not-\ning the \u201cimportant question\u201d whether \u201cspecial venue provisions\u201d \nlike the FSIA\u2019s Section 1391(f\u200a) \u201cdisplace\u201d Section 1391(b)). \n\n34 \n \nSee Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 128-129 (1995) \n(Thomas, J, concurring) (quoting The Federalist No. 78, \nat 529 (Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., \n1961)).  Non-constitutional provisions governing federal \nadjudication likewise ensure that a foreign state is \ntreated fairly in federal court.  See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. \n1 (rules apply in \u201call civil actions and proceedings\u201d in \ndistrict court); see also, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 455; Code of Con-\nduct for United States Judges, Canon 3A and 3C (2019).  \nJust as federal adjudication remains eminently fair to \nour own States, such adjudication is similarly fair to the \nforeign states that may be sued under the FSIA. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nMARGARET L.

Definitions \n \nFor purposes of this chapter\u2014 \n \n(a) A \u2018\u2018foreign state\u2019\u2019, except as used in section \n1608 of this title, includes a political subdivision of a \nforeign state or an agency or instrumentality of a for-\neign state as defined in subsection (b). \n\n4a \n \n \n(b) An \u2018\u2018agency or instrumentality of a foreign \nstate\u2019\u2019 means any entity\u2014 \n \n(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate \nor otherwise, and \n \n(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or po-\nlitical subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose \nshares or other ownership interest is owned by a \nforeign state or political subdivision thereof, and \n \n(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the \nUnited States as defined in section 1332 (c) and \n(e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any \nthird country. \n \n(c) The \u2018\u2018United States\u2019\u2019 includes all territory and \nwaters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States. \n \n(d) A \u2018\u2018commercial activity\u2019\u2019 means either a regu-\nlar course of commercial conduct or a particular com-\nmercial transaction or act.  The commercial charac-\nter of an activity shall be determined by reference to \nthe nature of the course of conduct or particular \ntransaction or act, rather than by reference to its \npurpose. \n \n(e) A \u2018\u2018commercial activity carried on in the \nUnited States by a foreign state\u2019\u2019 means commercial \nactivity carried on by such state and having substan-\ntial contact with the United States. \n \n\u00a7 1604.  Immunity of a foreign state from jurisdiction \n \nSubject to existing international agreements to which \nthe United States is a party at the time of enactment of \nthis Act a foreign state shall be immune from the juris-\n\n5a \n \ndiction of the courts of the United States and of the \nStates except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607 of this \nchapter. \n \n\u00a7 1605.  General exceptions to the jurisdictional immun-\nity of a foreign state \n \n(a\u200a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the ju-\nrisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States \nin any case\u2014 \n \n(1) in which the foreign state has waived its im-\nmunity either explicitly or by implication, notwith-\nstanding any withdrawal of the waiver which the for-\neign state may purport to effect except in accordance \nwith the terms of the waiver; \n \n(2) in which the action is based upon a commer-\ncial activity carried on in the United States by the \nforeign state; or upon an act performed in the United \nStates in connection with a commercial activity of the \nforeign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the \nterritory of the United States in connection with a \ncommercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and \nthat act causes a direct effect in the United States; \n \n(3) in which rights in property taken in violation \nof international law are in issue and that property or \nany property exchanged for such property is present \nin the United States in connection with a commercial \nactivity carried on in the United States by the for-\neign state; or that property or any property ex-\nchanged for such property is owned or operated by \nan agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and \nthat agency or instrumentality is engaged in a com-\nmercial activity in the United States; \n\n6a \n \n \n(4) in which rights in property in the United States \nacquired by succession or gift or rights in immovable \nproperty situated in the United States are in issue; \n \n(5) not otherwise encompassed in paragraph (2) \nabove, in which money damages are sought against a \nforeign state for personal injury or death, or damage \nto or loss of property, occurring in the United States \nand caused by the tortious act or omission of that for-\neign state or of any official or employee of that foreign \nstate while acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment; except this paragraph shall not apply to\u2014 \n \n(A) any claim based upon the exercise or perfor-\nmance or the failure to exercise or perform a dis-\ncretionary function regardless of whether the dis-\ncretion be abused, or  \n \n(B) any claim arising out of malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract rights; \nor \n \n(6) in which the action is brought, either to enforce \nan agreement made by the foreign state with or for \nthe benefit of a private party to submit to arbitration \nall or any differences which have arisen or which may \narise between the parties with respect to a defined \nlegal relationship, whether contractual or not, con-\ncerning a subject matter capable of settlement by ar-\nbitration under the laws of the United States, or to \nconfirm an award made pursuant to such an agree-\nment to arbitrate, if (A) the arbitration takes place \nor is intended to take place in the United States,  \n(B) the agreement or award is or may be governed \nby a treaty or other international agreement in force \nfor the United States calling for the recognition and \n\n7a \n \nenforcement of arbitral awards, (C) the underlying \nclaim, save for the agreement to arbitrate, could have \nbeen brought in a United States court under this sec-\ntion or section 1607, or (D) paragraph (1) of this sub-\nsection is otherwise applicable. \n \n(b) A foreign state shall not be immune from the ju-\nrisdiction of the courts of the United States in any case \nin which a suit in admiralty is brought to enforce a mar-\nitime lien against a vessel or cargo of the foreign state, \nwhich maritime lien is based upon a commercial activity \nof the foreign state:  Provided, That\u2014 \n \n(1) notice of the suit is given by delivery of a copy \nof the summons and of the complaint to the person, \nor his agent, having possession of the vessel or cargo \nagainst which the maritime lien is asserted; and if the \nvessel or cargo is arrested pursuant to process ob-\ntained on behalf of the party bringing the suit, the ser-\nvice of process of arrest shall be deemed to constitute \nvalid delivery of such notice, but the party bringing \nthe suit shall be liable for any damages sustained by \nthe foreign state as a result of the arrest if the party \nbringing the suit had actual or constructive knowledge \nthat the vessel or cargo of a foreign state was in-\nvolved; and \n \n(2) notice to the foreign state of the commence-\nment of suit as provided in section 1608 of this title \nis initiated within ten days either of the delivery of \nnotice as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection \nor, in the case of a party who was unaware that the \nvessel or cargo of a foreign state was involved, of the \ndate such party determined the existence of the for-\neign state\u2019s interest. \n*  *  *  *  * \n\n8a \n \n\u00a7 1605A.

          "task_beliefs": "My current beliefs are reinforced by the latest observation, which was an internal reasoning step summarizing the significant impact of the respondent's Brief in Opposition. This observation does not introduce new external evidence, so my understanding of the core legal dynamics of the case remains stable and is best captured by the previous update. The key elements of my belief state are:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Argument (Stable):** The petitioner's case rests on a textualist reading of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) to displace the `International Shoe` minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction under the FSIA, and a constitutional argument that foreign sovereigns are not \"persons\" with Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Counter-Framework (Stable and Foundational):** My understanding of Antrix's defense, derived from their Brief in Opposition, remains the central update to my model. This defense consists of three key pillars:\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** Congress intended the FSIA's exceptions to immunity to align with, not abrogate, traditional minimum contacts principles.\n    *   **Precedent Distinction:** The petitioner's supporting case law is distinguishable as it primarily involves the unique state-sponsored terrorism exception, which has a different statutory basis and purpose than the arbitration exception at issue here.\n    *   **Constitutional Avoidance Doctrines:** This remains the most significant development. Antrix has provided the Court with two narrow grounds to rule in its favor without deciding the major constitutional question:\n        *   **Entity Distinction:** Antrix, as a state-owned corporation, is a separate juridical \"person\" entitled to due process, regardless of whether a foreign *state* is. This is a powerful, case-specific argument.\n        *   **Poor Vehicle/Mootness:** The nullification of the underlying arbitral award in India makes this case a procedurally awkward vehicle for a landmark ruling.\n\n3.  **Updated Predictive Model (Stable):** The observation confirms my previous analysis. The case is no longer a simple binary choice on the main legal question. My predictive model now heavily weights the probability that the Court will seize upon one of the constitutional avoidance \"off-ramps\" provided by the respondent. The \"entity distinction\" argument, in particular, seems like a classic Roberts Court solution\u2014a narrow, technical ruling that resolves the specific dispute while leaving the broader, more contentious constitutional question for another day. My confidence in a victory for the petitioner is therefore significantly lower than it was initially.\n\n4.  **Current Uncertainty (Stable):** The observation was my own internal thought process, which correctly identified the next critical point of uncertainty: which of these competing legal frameworks will the Court find most persuasive? The observation also correctly identified that the single most valuable piece of information to resolve this uncertainty would be the views of the United States, as expressed in a brief by the Solicitor General, given the case's implications for foreign policy and statutory interpretation. My belief state is now primed to receive and analyze that specific piece of evidence.",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the amicus curiae brief filed by the Solicitor General (SG) on behalf of the United States is a highly significant event that directly addresses the central uncertainty in my previous belief state. It provides the Executive Branch's formal position, which carries substantial weight in cases involving foreign relations and the interpretation of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Argument (Stable but Massively Reinforced):** The petitioner's core statutory and constitutional arguments remain the same. However, they are now massively reinforced by the explicit support of the United States. The SG's brief adopts the petitioner's textualist reading of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) and its constitutional position that foreign sovereigns are not \"persons\" under the Fifth Amendment.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Counter-Framework (Significantly Weakened):** My understanding of Antrix's defense is stable, but its potential persuasiveness is now significantly diminished. The SG's brief directly counters Antrix's key pillars:\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** The SG argues forcefully that the FSIA's text and structure do *not* require a separate minimum contacts analysis, directly refuting Antrix's position that Congress intended to incorporate it.\n    *   **Constitutional Avoidance Doctrines:** This is the most critical update. The \"off-ramps\" I previously identified as favoring the respondent (the \"entity distinction\" and \"poor vehicle\" arguments) are now countered by more compelling, petitioner-friendly \"off-ramps\" supplied by the SG. The SG's brief has co-opted the avoidance strategy to favor the petitioner.\n\n3.  **New Foundational Evidence (The SG's Framework):** The SG's brief introduces a new, highly influential framework for deciding the case in the petitioner's favor. This is the primary update to my model. The SG's arguments are:\n    *   **Primary Statutory Argument:** The FSIA's text is dispositive. Section 1330(b) means that if subject-matter jurisdiction exists under an FSIA exception (like the arbitration exception here) and service is proper, personal jurisdiction is automatically established. No further `International Shoe` analysis is required by the statute.\n    *   **Primary Constitutional Argument:** The SG explicitly argues that a foreign state is not a \"person\" entitled to Fifth Amendment due process rights, lending the full weight of the Executive Branch to the petitioner's broadest argument.\n    *   **Alternative Petitioner-Friendly \"Off-Ramps\":** The SG provides the Court with two narrower grounds to rule for the petitioner without needing to decide the major constitutional question:\n        *   **Consent/Waiver Theory:** Antrix, by agreeing to an arbitration clause stating the award could be \"enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and entered in any court of competent jurisdiction,\" effectively consented to personal jurisdiction in any U.S. court with a valid basis to enforce the award. This is a powerful, case-specific argument that avoids the broad constitutional issue entirely.\n        *   **Procedural Remand:** The Court could reverse the Ninth Circuit on the statutory question alone and remand the case for the lower court to consider the constitutional due process arguments in the first instance. This would still hand the petitioner a victory at the Supreme Court level.\n\n4.  **Updated Predictive Model (Major Shift):** The SG's brief fundamentally reshapes my predictive model. My confidence in a victory for the petitioner (Devas) has increased dramatically.\n    *   The probability has shifted away from the respondent's \"off-ramps\" (like the entity distinction) and towards the petitioner-friendly \"off-ramps\" (especially the consent/waiver theory).\n    *   The consent/waiver argument, in particular, now appears to be a highly probable path for the Court. It is a classic narrow, case-dispositive ruling that would resolve this dispute without setting a sweeping constitutional precedent about the rights of all foreign sovereigns. It is a more direct and elegant solution than the respondent's \"entity distinction\" argument.\n    *   The SG's strong endorsement makes a straightforward reversal on statutory grounds much more likely than before.\n\n5.  **Current Uncertainty (Refined):** My primary uncertainty is no longer *if* the petitioner will win, but *on what grounds*. The SG has provided a menu of options for a petitioner victory. The key question is which option the Court will choose:\n    *   The broad, landmark constitutional ruling that foreign states lack due process rights?\n    *   The narrow, case-specific ruling that Antrix consented to jurisdiction?\n    *   The simple statutory reversal with a remand on the constitutional question?\n    My model now assigns the highest probability to a narrow ruling based on the consent/waiver theory, as it aligns with the Court's preference for avoiding broad constitutional questions when a case can be resolved on narrower grounds.",
