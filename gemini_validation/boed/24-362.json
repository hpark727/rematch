    "facts_of_the_case": "In October 2017, six FBI agents, led by Special Agent Lawrence Guerra, mistakenly executed a no-knock search warrant at the home of Curtrina Martin and her family in Atlanta, Georgia. The intended target was a nearby home suspected to contain violent gang member Joseph Riley. Due to similarities between the two properties and issues with navigating to the correct address, the agents entered Martin\u2019s home instead. The SWAT team, in full tactical gear, entered the house, causing fear and distress to its occupants. They later realized the mistake and promptly left the scene, later apologizing and assuring the family that the FBI would handle any damages.\n\nMartin and her family sued the U.S. government and the agents, claiming violations of their Fourth Amendment rights and seeking damages under Georgia state law. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the decision, ruling that the agents were entitled to qualified immunity and that the Federal Tort Claims Act claims were barred by the Supremacy Clause and the discretionary function exception.",

The target address\u2014which was report-\nedly the home of Jospeh [sie] Riley, a violent gang mem-\nber\u2014was located approximately a block away from Ap-\npellants\u2019 house and shared similar conspicuous features\nwith Appellants\u2019 house.\n\nAppellants initiated an action against the FBI agents\npursuant to Bivens x: Six Unknown Named Agents of\nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) and the\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\nFTCA\u201d, alleging that the FBI agents violated their\nFourth Amendment rights and were also liable for dam-\nages under Georgia tort law. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the FBI agents and the\nUnited States.\n\nda\nAppendix A\nAfter careful review of the record and the parties\u2019\n\nbriefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\n{judgment and dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 18, 2017, during the predawn hours, a\nteam of six unidentified FBI agents\u2014ted by special\nagent, Lawrence Guerra\u2014exeeuted a presumably valid\nsearch warrant at 3756 Denville Trace, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 80331, Appellants\u2019 home. The target location of\nthe search warrant was 3741 Landau Lane, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 30381, which is located approximately three\nhouses away from Appellants\u2019 house. Despite taking\nseveral precautionary measures to ensure proper exe-\nceution of the search warrant, Guerra and the FBI agents\ninadvertently executed the search warrant at the wrong\nhouse.\n\nA. The FBI's Operation Red Tape\n\nIn 2015, the FBI initiated Operation Red Tape\u2014an\noperation concerning violent gang activity in Georgia.\n\u2018The Operation resulted in a criminal indictment and the\nissuance of arrest warrants for several individuals, in-\ncluding Riley. The FBT assigned Guerra to lead a Special\nWeapons and Tacties (\u201cSWAT\u201d) team that was tasked\nwith executing the arrest warrant for Riley at 8741 Lan-\ndan Lane,\n\nIn preparation for the warrant execution, the FBI\ncreated a general operation order and a SWAT adden-\ndum to the operation order: The SWAT addendum con-\ntained photographs of Riley, a description of his violent\n\nAppendix A\nhistory and gun possession, a photograph of 3741 Li\ndau Lane, SW, Atlanta, Georgia 30331, an overhead map\nimage of the neighborhood, and directions to 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane, Prior to the warrant execution, Guerra re-\nviewed a copy of the general operation order and the\nSWAT addendum.\n\nB. Pro-Execution Preparation\n\n\u2018The FBI has a standard operating procedure that its\nagents conduet a site survey or a drive-by prior to exe-\nceuting a high-risk warrant such as the one for Riley's ar-\nrest. However, the FBI does not have any policies gov-\ncerning how to locate or navigate to a target address nor\ndoes it prohibit using a personal GPS to locate a target\naddress.\n\nShortly before the warrant execution, Guerra and\nanother FBI agent, Gregory Donovan condueted a site\nsurvey of 8741 Landau Lane during daylight hours.\nThey used the Google Maps application on Donovan's\ncellphone to navigate to 8741 Landau Lane.\n\nDuring the site survey, Guerra took several photo-\ngraphs of 8741 Landau Lane, He also documented spe-\ncifie physical features of 3741 Landau Lane that he be-\nlieved were unique to the house, He noted that the house\nwas beige and split-level it was located on a corner lot;\nit had a side-entry garage on a separate street that ran\nperpendicular to the front door; it had a very large tree\nin the front yard; and the house number appeared on a\n\u2018small mailbox and not on the front of the house.\n\n\n6a\nAppendix A\n\nAfter Guerra completed the site survey, he identified\na staging area where the SWAT team would meet prior\nto the warrant execution. Additionally, he made tactical\nnotes of the order in whieh each SWAT team member\n\u2018would position themselves outside of 3741 Landau Lane\nand assigned tasks to each SWAT team member for the\nwarrant execution,\n\nIn addition to completing the site survey, Guerra at-\ntended an operational briefing regarding the warrant\nexecution, The briefing consisted of several presenta-\ntions that included photographs of Riley and 8741 Lan-\ndau Lane,\n\nOn the day of the warrant execution, Guerra and\nFBI special agent, Michael Lemoine, eondueted a pre-\nraid drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane. It was completely\ndark outside when they conducted the pre-raid drive-by.\nGuerra used his personal GPS deviee to navigate to 3741\nLandau Lane. Although he entered 3741 Landau Lane\ninto his GPS deviee, it directed him and Lemoine to 3756\nDenville Trace\u2014Appellants\u2019 house. Appellants\u2019 house is\napproximately 436 feet from 3741 Landau Lane. Alt-\nhough Appellants\u2019 house is located on Denville Trace, it\nfaces Landan Lane,\n\nGuerra believed he was at 8741 Landau Lane be-\ncause Appellants\u2019 house had many of the same features\nthat he noted for the target address during his site sur-\nvey. Similar to 8741 Landau Lane, Appellants\u2019 house\n\n\u00a2; it was located on the corner of the street; it\nwas split-level; it eontained a stairwell to the front door;\nthere was a very large tree in front of the house; it had\n\n\nTa\nAppendix A\n\na side-entry garage on a separate street that ran per-\n\npendicular to the front door; and the house number did\n\nnot appear anywhere on the house, but instead appeared\n\n\u2018on the mailbox. Although the mailbox is visible from the\n\nstreet, the house number is not.\n\nGuerra and Lemoine noticed a black Camaro in Ap-\npellants\u2019 driveway that Guerra did not recall seeing\nwhen he completed his site survey of 8741 Landau Lane\na few days earlier. They would later use the black Ca-\nmaro and a large tree as reference points when search-\ning for the target address for the warrant execution,\n\n. Search Warrant Execution\n\nAround 3:30 am. on the day of the warrant execu-\ntion, Guerra arrived at the staging area and briefed the\n\u2018SWAT team and officers from the Atlanta Police Depart-\nment (\u201cAPD\u201d). Guerra showed the SWAT team mem-\nbers photographs of 3741 Landau Lane and Riley, and\nhe briefed the agents on his tactical plan regarding the\nwarrant execution.\n\nFollowing the briefing and while it was still dark out-\nside, the SWAT team and APD officers\u2014led by\nGuerra\u2014headed towards the target address in a eara-\nvan of vehicles. When Guerra spotted the black Camaro,\nhe stopped his vehicle in front of Appellants\u2019 house, be-\nlieving that he was at 3741 Landau Lane, and the other\nvehicles followed suit. The SWAT team\u2014dressed in full\ntactical gear and armed with rifles and handguns\u2014\nquickly exited the vehicles and reported to their as-\nsigned! locations surrounding Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra\nKnocked and announced the presence of law\n\n8a\nAppendix A\n\nenforcement before an agent breached the front. door.\nAnother agent deployed a flashbang at the entrance of\nthe home. The SWAT team entered the house.\n\nWhen the SWAT team entered Appellants\u2019 house,\nCliatt\u2014afraid that their home was being burglarized\u2014\nrran towards the betlroom closet where he kept a shotgun\nfor protection. As Cliatt ran towards the bedroom\ncloset, Martin bolted towards the door to get her then\nseven-year-old son. However, Cliatt pulled Martin to-\nwards their bedroom closet, and the two hid in there,\n\nA SWAT team member located Cliatt and Martin in\ntheir bedroom closet, dragged Cliatt out of the closet\nand onto the bedroom floor with guns pointed at him,\nand handcuffed him, During the same time, Martin fell\nin the closet, and another SWAT team member pointed\ngun in her face while yelling at her to keep her hands\nup. No one handeuffed or touched Martin, Guerra en-\ntered the bedroom and realized that Cliatt did not have\nthe same face and neck tattoos that he observed in the\nphotographs of Riley, so he asked Cliatt for his name and\naddress, Cliatt provided Guerra with his name and ad-\ndress.\n\nWhile Guerra was in the bedroom questioning Cliatt,\nLemoine noticed a piece of mail that had a different ad-\ndress than 3741 Landau Lane and notified Guerra that\nthey were at the wrong address. Upon realizing that\nthey were at the wrong house, Guerra immediately\nended the raid: an agent lifted Cliat off the ground and\nuuneuffed him; Guerra told Cliatt that he would come\n\n\n9a\nAppendix A\n\nback later and explain what happened; and the agents\nleft the house.\n\nAfter leaving Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra and the\nSWAT team executed the search warrant at $741 Lan-\ndau Lane where they arrested Riley. After executing\nthe search warrant at the target address, Guerra re-\nturned to Appellants\u2019 house, apologized to them, docu-\nmented the damages caused by the mistaken raid, pro-\nvided them with the contact information for his supervi-\nsor, and advised them that the FBI would handle the\ndamage repairs.\n\nShortly after the mistaken raid at Appellants\u2019 house,\nGuerra reported the incident to the appropriate FBT\nrepresentative and completed an incident report.\nGuerra also stopped using his personal GPS for warrant\nexecutions and eventually threw it away.\n\nD. Lawsuit\n\nIn September 2019, Appellants brought a Bivens\nclaim against Guerra and the six unidentified FBI\nagents who participated in the raid, alleging that Guerra\nand the agents\u2019 mistaken execution of the search war-\nrant at their house violated their Fourth Amendment\nrights. They also brought state law claims for negli-\ngence, negligent/intentional infliction of emotional dis-\ntress, trespass and interference with private property,\nfalse arrest/false imprisonment, and assault and battery\nagainst the United States under the FTCA. Guerra and\nthe government moved for summary judgment on Ap-\npellants\u2019 claims.\n\n\nWa\nAppendix A\n\n\u2018The distriet court granted in part and denied in part\nthe motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment on Appellants\u2019\nBivens claim and state law elaims for negligenee, negli-\ngent infliction of emotional distress, and trespass. How-\never, the district court denied summary judgment on the\nfalse imprisonment and assault and battery claims,\n\nFollowing the distrit court's grant of partial sum-\nmary judgment, the parties filed eross motions for re-\nconsideration. The distriet court held that, given our re-\ncent decision in Kordash v: United States, 51 Fath 1289\n(Lith Cir. 2022), the Supremacy Clause defense barred\nAppellants\u2019 remaining FTCA tort claims.\n\n\u2018The district court entered judgment and Appellants\ntimely appealed.\n\nI STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment de novo, Holloman v.

Scott\u00bb: Harris, 550 US. 372,380 2007).\n\nIIL DISCUSSION\n\nA, The District Court Properly Determined\nthat Qualified Immunity Protects Guerra\nfrom Suit.\n\nAppellants argue that Guerra is not entitled to qual-\nified immunity because his mistaken execution of the\nsearch warrant at their house was not a reasonable mis-\ntake and, therefore, his conduet violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\nQualified immunity protects government actors per-\nforming diseretionary functions from civil liability.\nAndujar v. Rodriquez, 486 Fd 1199, 1202 (11th Cin.\n2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Govern-\nment officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\ntheir conduct violates \u201cclearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.\u201d Merricks v, Adkisson, 785 F3d 553, 558\n\n(1th Cir. 2015) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 US.\n\n800, 818 (1982)\n\n\u2018To \u201cresolv{e] questions of qualified immunity at sum-\nmary judgment,\u201d we conduct \u201ca two-pronged inquiry.\u201d\nTolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 655 (2014) (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). First, we ask \u201cwhether the\nfacts, taken in the light most favorable to the party as~\nserting the injury\u2019... show the officers eonduet violated\na federal right.\u201d 1d. at 655-56 alterations adopted) (quo\ntation marks and citation omitted). Next, we must de-\ncide \u201cwhether the right in question was \u2018clearly estab-\nlished\u2019 at the time of the violation.\u201d dat 656 (quoting\nHope v, Pelzer, 536 U.S. 73, 739 (2002) To determine\nwhether a right is clearly established, we ask whether\nthe law on the date ofthe alleged misconduet gave the\ndefendant fair notice that their alleged misconduct was,\nunconstitutional. Hardigree, 922 F3d at 1224 (citing\nHope, 536 US. at TD,\n\nHere, itis undisputed that Guerra was aeting within\nhis discretionary authority, so the sole issue for our res-\nolution is whether his actions violated clearly estab-\nlished law.\n\n\u2018The Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, protects individu-\nals from unreasonable searches of their property. Gen-\nznusa \u00a5.

Thus, the\n\u201ctouchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonable-\nness.\" Ohio v Robinette, 519 U.S. 8, 39 (1986) (quota-\ntion marks omitted) (quoting Florida t: Jimeno, 500 U.S.\n248, 250 (1991) Reasonableness is measured \u201cby exam-\nining the totality of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn Hartsfield, we explained that an officer who\nmakes \u201creasonable effort{s} to ascertain and identify\nthe\u201d target address of a valid search warrant complies\nwith the Fourth Amendment even if error is ultimately\nnot averted. 50 Fd at 954-55 (quoting Garrison, 480\nU.S. at 88-89). Appellants contend that Guerra filed to\nmake reasonable efforts to identify 3741 Landau Lane\nbefore mistakenly executing the warrant at their house\nSpecifically, Appellants argue that Guerra did not con-\nduct a site survey or drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane prior\nto the warrant execution. Assuming Guerra failed to\nconduet a survey or pre-raid drive-by, the other actions\nhe took to identify 3741 Landau Lane were \u201cconsistent,\nwith a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the\nplace intended to be searched.\u201d See Hartsfield, 50 Fd\nat 955 (quoting Garrison, 480 U.S. at 88-89). He re-\nviewed the operation order and SWAT addendum; he\n\n\nMa\nAppendix A\n\nattended an operational briefing that consisted of sev-\n\neral presentations displaying photographs of Riley and\n\n3741 Landau Lane; and he selected a staging area and,\n\n\u2018made tactical notes that considered the loeation and fea-\n\ntures of the target address,\n\nAdditionally, the faet that the target address and Ap-\npellants\u2019 house share several conspicuous features\ndemonstrates that Guerra\u2019s execution of the warrant at\nthe wrong house constituted an inadvertent mistake.\nBoth houses are beige in color, located on a corner lot,\nhave a large tree in the front, contain a stairwell to the\nfront door, are split-level, and have a side-entry garage\non a separate street that runs perpendicular to the front\ndoor: Further, Guerra and the SWAT team executed the\nwarrant while it was still dark outside and difficult to\nascertain the house numbers on the mailboxes. Guerra\nand the SWAT team had to enter a potentially danger-\nous situation to execute the warrant\u2014the home of a vi-\nTherefore, the decisions that\nin the rapidly-chang-\ning and dangerous situation of exeeuting a high-risk\nwarrant at night constitute the kind of reasonable mis-\ntakes that the Fourth Amendment contemplates. See,\neg, Heien v. North Carolina, 574 US. 54, 60-61 (2014)\n(To be reasonable is not to be perfect, and so the Fourth\nAmendment allows for some mistakes on the part of\ngovernment officials, giving them fair lee-way for en-\nforcing the law in the community's protection\u2019 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); Willingham \u00a5.\nLoughnan, 321 F'3d 1299, 1308 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cOfficers\nfacing split-seeond decisions in dangerous or life-threat-\nening situations are seldom provided with fair warning,\n\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\nnotice or guidance by a general requirement of reason-\nableness.\u201d).\n\nGuerra\u2019s preparatory steps before executing the\nwarrant complied with the FBIs standard prae-\ntices/procedures. The FBI affords its agents discretion\nin preparing for warrant executions: it has no official\npolicy or practice with respect to how agents are to lo-\ncate or navigate to the target address of a search war-\nrant, Additionally, while it is standard FBI practice to\nconduet a drive-by or site survey prior to executing a\nwarrant, those preparatory steps are fact-speeifie and\nleft to the agent's diseretion.\n\nIn sum, based on the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, we conclude that the law at the time did not clearly\nestablish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the\nwarrant exeeution would violate the Fourth Amend-\nment. Therefore, the district court did not err in grant\ning qualified immunity.\n\nB. The District Court Correctly Ruled that\nthe Supremacy Clause and the Discretion-\nary Function Exception Bar Appellants\u2019\nFTCA Claims.\n\nUnder the FTCA, a plaintiff may \u201cbring certain\nstate-law torts against\u201d the United States. Brownback\n\u00a5: King; 592 U.S. 209, 210 (2021). The FTCA waives the\nfederal government's sovereign immunity for the\nwrongful or negligent acts or omissions of its employees\nif a private person, under the same circumstances,\nwould be liable under the law of the state where the al-\nleged act or omission occurred. Swafford v. United\n\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\n\u2018States, 839 Fd 1365, 1369 (11th Cir, 2016) (citing 28\nUS.C.\u00a7 2674).\n\nHowever, the FTCA exempts from liability state-\ntort claims arising from a government official's perfor-\nmance of a duty or function that involves discretion,\nShivers v. United States, 1 Fath 924, 928 (11th Cir.\n2021). \u2018The discretionary function exception to the\nFTCA\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity exists to \u201cpre-\nvent judicial second guessing of ... administrative deei-\nsions.\u201d Jd. (quoting United States v. Gaubert, 499 US.\n2315, 328 (1991),\n\n\u2018To determine whether the diseretionary funetion ex-\nception applies in a given cireumstance, courts employ a\ntwo-factor test: they examine (1) whether the alleged\nact was diseretionary in nature meaning that the act \u201cin-\nvolved an element of judgment or choiee(;)\" and (2)\nwhether the act represented the kind of conduct \u201cthat\nthe diseretionary function exception was designed to\nshield.\u201d Swafford, 839 Fd at 1370 (first citing Berkovitz\nex rel, Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531 (1988);\nand then citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 323). \u201cThe disere-\ntionary function exception applies unlessa source of fed-\neral law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d\n\u2018Shivers, F.Ath at 981 (emphasis in original). The exeep-\ntion also applies irrespective of whether the government\nofficial abused his diseretion, Id. at 930 (quoting 28\nUS.C.\u00a7 2680(a),\n\nSimilar to the discretionary function exception, the\nSupremacy Clause ensures that states do not impede or\nburden the execution of federal law. Denson v. United\n\nVa\nAppendix A\n\nStates, 574 Fd 1818, 1836-7 (1th Cir. 2009). The gow-\nernment may invoke the Supremacy Clause against\nstate-tort liability if it demonstrates that the govern-\nment \u201cofficial's acts have some nexus with furthering\nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as\ncomplying with the full range of federal lav.\u201d Kordash,\n51 Fedth at 1293 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). A government official\u2019 acts bear \u201csome nexus\nwith furthering federal policy\u201d if he acted within the\nscope of his discretionary authority. Id. at 1294. Simi-\nlarly, a government officials acts could \u201creasonably be\ncharacterized as complying with the fall range of federal\nJaw\u201d ifhis acts complied with the relevant constitutional\nstandard\u2014the Fourth Amendment. Id.\n\nWhen faced with the determination of whether the\nactions a law enforcement officer took comply with the\nFourth Amendment, courts employ an \u201cobjective rea-\nsonableness\u201d standard and consider whether \u201cthe facts\navailable to the officer at the moment of the seizure or\nthe search [make] a [person] of reasonable caution\nbelie(vel that the action taken was appropriate.\u201d Croom\nx. Balkwill, 645 F'3d 1240, 1249 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting,\nTerry \u00a5. Ohio, 392.US,1, 21-22 (11th Cir, 1995).\n\nWe conclude that the diseretionary funetion exeep-\ntion bars Appellants\u2019 tort claims for trespass and inter-\nference with private property, negligent/intentional in-\nfliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The gov-\nernment has satisfied both elements of the dseretionary\nfunetion exception. With respect to the frst prong, the\nrecord\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to Appel-\nJants\u2014evinees that Guerra enjoyed discretion in how he\n\n18a\nAppendix A\n\nprepared for the warrant execution. As we previously\nexplained, the FBI did not have stringent policies or\nprocedures in place that dictate Aow agents are to pre-\npare for warrant exeeutions,\n\nFurthermore, the preparatory actions Guerra took\nbefore the warrant execution satisfy the second element\nof the diseretionary funetion exception test. In Mesa v\nUnited States, we explained that a federal officer\u2019s \u201cde-\ncision as to how to locate and identify the subject of an\narrest warrant prior to service of the warrant is suscep-\ntible to poliey analysis.\u201d 123 F:8d 1485, 1438 (11th Cin.\n1997). Although itis unfortunate that despite his prepar-\natory efforts, Guerra exeented the warrant at the wrong\nhouse, his actions, nevertheless, \u201cfall squarely within\nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d Shivers, 1 Fth at\n929,\n\n\u2018The Supremacy Clause bars Appellants\u2019 remaining\nFTCA claims for false imprisonment and assault and\nbattery. The district court initially denied summary\njudgment on Appellants\u2019 false imprisonment and assault,\nand battery claims on grounds that the discretionary\nfanetion exception could not defeat those claims be-\ncause under the FTCA\u2019 private person standard, Geor-\ngia\u2019s citizen's arrest statute does not contemplate the\ngood faith or reasonableness defenses that the govern-\nment asserted. However, on the government\u2019s motion\nfor reconsideration, the district court granted summary\njudgment on those claims, finding that our recent deci-\nsion in Kordash mandates dismissal of those claims.\n\n198\nAppendix A\n\nIn Kordash, we clarified that \u201cthe inquiry that deter-\n\u2018mines if the Supremacy Clause bars state-law liability is\nwhether a federal official's acts \u2018have some nexus with\nfurthering federal policy and ean reasonably be charae-\nterized as complying with the full range of {the Fourth\nAmendment)\u201d 51 Fath at 1283 (quoting Denson, 574\nF.3d at 1348). With respect to the first element, there is\nno doubt that Guerra acted within the seope of his dis-\nceretionary authority when he prepared for and exeeuted\nthe search warrant. The analysis we must conduct to ex-\namine whether Guerra complied with the full range of\nthe Fourth Amendment is the same as the inquiry we\nemployed in the qualified immunity analysis to deter-\nmine whether his actions violated the Fourth Amend-\nment, See id at 1294, As we already explained that\nGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\nthe government has satisfied both elements of the Su:\npremacy Clause analysis. Accordingly, the Supremacy\nClause bars Appellants\u2019 FTCA claims for false impris-\nonment and assault and battery.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment based on\nqualified\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The target address\u2014which was report-\nedly the home of Jospeh [sie] Riley, a violent gang mem-\nber\u2014was located approximately a block away from Ap-\npellants\u2019 house and shared similar conspicuous features\nwith Appellants\u2019 house.\n\nAppellants initiated an action against the FBI agents\npursuant to Bivens x: Six Unknown Named Agents of\nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) and the\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\nFTCA\u201d, alleging that the FBI agents violated their\nFourth Amendment rights and were also liable for dam-\nages under Georgia tort law. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the FBI agents and the\nUnited States.\n\nda\nAppendix A\nAfter careful review of the record and the parties\u2019\n\nbriefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\n{judgment and dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 18, 2017, during the predawn hours, a\nteam of six unidentified FBI agents\u2014ted by special\nagent, Lawrence Guerra\u2014exeeuted a presumably valid\nsearch warrant at 3756 Denville Trace, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 80331, Appellants\u2019 home. The target location of\nthe search warrant was 3741 Landau Lane, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 30381, which is located approximately three\nhouses away from Appellants\u2019 house. Despite taking\nseveral precautionary measures to ensure proper exe-\nceution of the search warrant, Guerra and the FBI agents\ninadvertently executed the search warrant at the wrong\nhouse.\n\nA. The FBI's Operation Red Tape\n\nIn 2015, the FBI initiated Operation Red Tape\u2014an\noperation concerning violent gang activity in Georgia.\n\u2018The Operation resulted in a criminal indictment and the\nissuance of arrest warrants for several individuals, in-\ncluding Riley. The FBT assigned Guerra to lead a Special\nWeapons and Tacties (\u201cSWAT\u201d) team that was tasked\nwith executing the arrest warrant for Riley at 8741 Lan-\ndan Lane,\n\nIn preparation for the warrant execution, the FBI\ncreated a general operation order and a SWAT adden-\ndum to the operation order: The SWAT addendum con-\ntained photographs of Riley, a description of his violent\n\nAppendix A\nhistory and gun possession, a photograph of 3741 Li\ndau Lane, SW, Atlanta, Georgia 30331, an overhead map\nimage of the neighborhood, and directions to 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane, Prior to the warrant execution, Guerra re-\nviewed a copy of the general operation order and the\nSWAT addendum.\n\nB. Pro-Execution Preparation\n\n\u2018The FBI has a standard operating procedure that its\nagents conduet a site survey or a drive-by prior to exe-\nceuting a high-risk warrant such as the one for Riley's ar-\nrest. However, the FBI does not have any policies gov-\ncerning how to locate or navigate to a target address nor\ndoes it prohibit using a personal GPS to locate a target\naddress.\n\nShortly before the warrant execution, Guerra and\nanother FBI agent, Gregory Donovan condueted a site\nsurvey of 8741 Landau Lane during daylight hours.\nThey used the Google Maps application on Donovan's\ncellphone to navigate to 8741 Landau Lane.\n\nDuring the site survey, Guerra took several photo-\ngraphs of 8741 Landau Lane, He also documented spe-\ncifie physical features of 3741 Landau Lane that he be-\nlieved were unique to the house, He noted that the house\nwas beige and split-level it was located on a corner lot;\nit had a side-entry garage on a separate street that ran\nperpendicular to the front door; it had a very large tree\nin the front yard; and the house number appeared on a\n\u2018small mailbox and not on the front of the house.\n\n\n6a\nAppendix A\n\nAfter Guerra completed the site survey, he identified\na staging area where the SWAT team would meet prior\nto the warrant execution. Additionally, he made tactical\nnotes of the order in whieh each SWAT team member\n\u2018would position themselves outside of 3741 Landau Lane\nand assigned tasks to each SWAT team member for the\nwarrant execution,\n\nIn addition to completing the site survey, Guerra at-\ntended an operational briefing regarding the warrant\nexecution, The briefing consisted of several presenta-\ntions that included photographs of Riley and 8741 Lan-\ndau Lane,\n\nOn the day of the warrant execution, Guerra and\nFBI special agent, Michael Lemoine, eondueted a pre-\nraid drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane. It was completely\ndark outside when they conducted the pre-raid drive-by.\nGuerra used his personal GPS deviee to navigate to 3741\nLandau Lane. Although he entered 3741 Landau Lane\ninto his GPS deviee, it directed him and Lemoine to 3756\nDenville Trace\u2014Appellants\u2019 house. Appellants\u2019 house is\napproximately 436 feet from 3741 Landau Lane. Alt-\nhough Appellants\u2019 house is located on Denville Trace, it\nfaces Landan Lane,\n\nGuerra believed he was at 8741 Landau Lane be-\ncause Appellants\u2019 house had many of the same features\nthat he noted for the target address during his site sur-\nvey. Similar to 8741 Landau Lane, Appellants\u2019 house\n\n\u00a2; it was located on the corner of the street; it\nwas split-level; it eontained a stairwell to the front door;\nthere was a very large tree in front of the house; it had\n\n\nTa\nAppendix A\n\na side-entry garage on a separate street that ran per-\n\npendicular to the front door; and the house number did\n\nnot appear anywhere on the house, but instead appeared\n\n\u2018on the mailbox. Although the mailbox is visible from the\n\nstreet, the house number is not.\n\nGuerra and Lemoine noticed a black Camaro in Ap-\npellants\u2019 driveway that Guerra did not recall seeing\nwhen he completed his site survey of 8741 Landau Lane\na few days earlier. They would later use the black Ca-\nmaro and a large tree as reference points when search-\ning for the target address for the warrant execution,\n\n. Search Warrant Execution\n\nAround 3:30 am. on the day of the warrant execu-\ntion, Guerra arrived at the staging area and briefed the\n\u2018SWAT team and officers from the Atlanta Police Depart-\nment (\u201cAPD\u201d). Guerra showed the SWAT team mem-\nbers photographs of 3741 Landau Lane and Riley, and\nhe briefed the agents on his tactical plan regarding the\nwarrant execution.\n\nFollowing the briefing and while it was still dark out-\nside, the SWAT team and APD officers\u2014led by\nGuerra\u2014headed towards the target address in a eara-\nvan of vehicles. When Guerra spotted the black Camaro,\nhe stopped his vehicle in front of Appellants\u2019 house, be-\nlieving that he was at 3741 Landau Lane, and the other\nvehicles followed suit. The SWAT team\u2014dressed in full\ntactical gear and armed with rifles and handguns\u2014\nquickly exited the vehicles and reported to their as-\nsigned! locations surrounding Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra\nKnocked and announced the presence of law\n\n8a\nAppendix A\n\nenforcement before an agent breached the front. door.\nAnother agent deployed a flashbang at the entrance of\nthe home. The SWAT team entered the house.\n\nWhen the SWAT team entered Appellants\u2019 house,\nCliatt\u2014afraid that their home was being burglarized\u2014\nrran towards the betlroom closet where he kept a shotgun\nfor protection. As Cliatt ran towards the bedroom\ncloset, Martin bolted towards the door to get her then\nseven-year-old son. However, Cliatt pulled Martin to-\nwards their bedroom closet, and the two hid in there,\n\nA SWAT team member located Cliatt and Martin in\ntheir bedroom closet, dragged Cliatt out of the closet\nand onto the bedroom floor with guns pointed at him,\nand handcuffed him, During the same time, Martin fell\nin the closet, and another SWAT team member pointed\ngun in her face while yelling at her to keep her hands\nup. No one handeuffed or touched Martin, Guerra en-\ntered the bedroom and realized that Cliatt did not have\nthe same face and neck tattoos that he observed in the\nphotographs of Riley, so he asked Cliatt for his name and\naddress, Cliatt provided Guerra with his name and ad-\ndress.\n\nWhile Guerra was in the bedroom questioning Cliatt,\nLemoine noticed a piece of mail that had a different ad-\ndress than 3741 Landau Lane and notified Guerra that\nthey were at the wrong address. Upon realizing that\nthey were at the wrong house, Guerra immediately\nended the raid: an agent lifted Cliat off the ground and\nuuneuffed him; Guerra told Cliatt that he would come\n\n\n9a\nAppendix A\n\nback later and explain what happened; and the agents\nleft the house.\n\nAfter leaving Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra and the\nSWAT team executed the search warrant at $741 Lan-\ndau Lane where they arrested Riley. After executing\nthe search warrant at the target address, Guerra re-\nturned to Appellants\u2019 house, apologized to them, docu-\nmented the damages caused by the mistaken raid, pro-\nvided them with the contact information for his supervi-\nsor, and advised them that the FBI would handle the\ndamage repairs.\n\nShortly after the mistaken raid at Appellants\u2019 house,\nGuerra reported the incident to the appropriate FBT\nrepresentative and completed an incident report.\nGuerra also stopped using his personal GPS for warrant\nexecutions and eventually threw it away.\n\nD. Lawsuit\n\nIn September 2019, Appellants brought a Bivens\nclaim against Guerra and the six unidentified FBI\nagents who participated in the raid, alleging that Guerra\nand the agents\u2019 mistaken execution of the search war-\nrant at their house violated their Fourth Amendment\nrights. They also brought state law claims for negli-\ngence, negligent/intentional infliction of emotional dis-\ntress, trespass and interference with private property,\nfalse arrest/false imprisonment, and assault and battery\nagainst the United States under the FTCA. Guerra and\nthe government moved for summary judgment on Ap-\npellants\u2019 claims.\n\n\nWa\nAppendix A\n\n\u2018The distriet court granted in part and denied in part\nthe motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment on Appellants\u2019\nBivens claim and state law elaims for negligenee, negli-\ngent infliction of emotional distress, and trespass. How-\never, the district court denied summary judgment on the\nfalse imprisonment and assault and battery claims,\n\nFollowing the distrit court's grant of partial sum-\nmary judgment, the parties filed eross motions for re-\nconsideration. The distriet court held that, given our re-\ncent decision in Kordash v: United States, 51 Fath 1289\n(Lith Cir. 2022), the Supremacy Clause defense barred\nAppellants\u2019 remaining FTCA tort claims.\n\n\u2018The district court entered judgment and Appellants\ntimely appealed.\n\nI STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment de novo, Holloman v. Mail- Well Corp, 443 F.3d\n\u2018S32, 836 (11th Cir. 2006), and denial of a motion for re-\nconsideration for abuse of discretion. Corwin v. Walt\nDisney Co., 475 F:3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir, 2007). We also\nreview de novo the district court's qualified immunity\nanalysis. Hardigree s: Lofton, 992 F3d 1216, 1223 (11th\nCir. 2021).

Paramount Pietures Corp. 20 F454, 459 (11th\nCin. 1994). At the summary judgment stage, we con-\nstrue all facts and make all reasonable inferences in fa-\nvor of the non-moving party. Baxter, 54 Fath at 1253,\n(quoting Stryker \u00a5. City of Homewood, 978 F33d 769, 773\n(Lith Cir. 2020). However, we must only view the evi-\ndence in alight most favorable to the non-moving party\ntothe extent that the non-moving party's position is up-\nported by the record, Zd. Therefore, simply because\nsome alleged factual dispute exists between the parties\ndoes not mean summary judgment cannot be otherwise\ngranted. Scott\u00bb: Harris, 550 US. 372,380 2007).\n\nIIL DISCUSSION\n\nA, The District Court Properly Determined\nthat Qualified Immunity Protects Guerra\nfrom Suit.\n\nAppellants argue that Guerra is not entitled to qual-\nified immunity because his mistaken execution of the\nsearch warrant at their house was not a reasonable mis-\ntake and, therefore, his conduet violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\nQualified immunity protects government actors per-\nforming diseretionary functions from civil liability.\nAndujar v. Rodriquez, 486 Fd 1199, 1202 (11th Cin.\n2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Govern-\nment officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\ntheir conduct violates \u201cclearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.\u201d Merricks v, Adkisson, 785 F3d 553, 558\n\n(1th Cir. 2015) (quoting Harlow v.

Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 655 (2014) (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).

Hardigree, 922 F3d at 1224 (citing\nHope, 536 US. at TD,\n\nHere, itis undisputed that Guerra was aeting within\nhis discretionary authority, so the sole issue for our res-\nolution is whether his actions violated clearly estab-\nlished law.\n\n\u2018The Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, protects individu-\nals from unreasonable searches of their property.

Appellants contend that Guerra filed to\nmake reasonable efforts to identify 3741 Landau Lane\nbefore mistakenly executing the warrant at their house\nSpecifically, Appellants argue that Guerra did not con-\nduct a site survey or drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane prior\nto the warrant execution. Assuming Guerra failed to\nconduet a survey or pre-raid drive-by, the other actions\nhe took to identify 3741 Landau Lane were \u201cconsistent,\nwith a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the\nplace intended to be searched.\u201d See Hartsfield, 50 Fd\nat 955 (quoting Garrison, 480 U.S. at 88-89).

North Carolina, 574 US. 54, 60-61 (2014)\n(To be reasonable is not to be perfect, and so the Fourth\nAmendment allows for some mistakes on the part of\ngovernment officials, giving them fair lee-way for en-\nforcing the law in the community's protection\u2019 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); Willingham \u00a5.\nLoughnan, 321 F'3d 1299, 1308 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cOfficers\nfacing split-seeond decisions in dangerous or life-threat-\nening situations are seldom provided with fair warning,\n\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\nnotice or guidance by a general requirement of reason-\nableness.\u201d).\n\nGuerra\u2019s preparatory steps before executing the\nwarrant complied with the FBIs standard prae-\ntices/procedures. The FBI affords its agents discretion\nin preparing for warrant executions: it has no official\npolicy or practice with respect to how agents are to lo-\ncate or navigate to the target address of a search war-\nrant, Additionally, while it is standard FBI practice to\nconduet a drive-by or site survey prior to executing a\nwarrant, those preparatory steps are fact-speeifie and\nleft to the agent's diseretion.\n\nIn sum, based on the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, we conclude that the law at the time did not clearly\nestablish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the\nwarrant exeeution would violate the Fourth Amend-\nment. Therefore, the district court did not err in grant\ning qualified immunity.\n\nB. The District Court Correctly Ruled that\nthe Supremacy Clause and the Discretion-\nary Function Exception Bar Appellants\u2019\nFTCA Claims.\n\nUnder the FTCA, a plaintiff may \u201cbring certain\nstate-law torts against\u201d the United States.

The FTCA waives the\nfederal government's sovereign immunity for the\nwrongful or negligent acts or omissions of its employees\nif a private person, under the same circumstances,\nwould be liable under the law of the state where the al-\nleged act or omission occurred.

United States, 486 U.S. 531 (1988);\nand then citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 323). \u201cThe disere-\ntionary function exception applies unlessa source of fed-\neral law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d\n\u2018Shivers, F.Ath at 981 (emphasis in original). The exeep-\ntion also applies irrespective of whether the government\nofficial abused his diseretion, Id. at 930 (quoting 28\nUS.C.\u00a7 2680(a),\n\nSimilar to the discretionary function exception, the\nSupremacy Clause ensures that states do not impede or\nburden the execution of federal law.

The gow-\nernment may invoke the Supremacy Clause against\nstate-tort liability if it demonstrates that the govern-\nment \u201cofficial's acts have some nexus with furthering\nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as\ncomplying with the full range of federal lav.\u201d Kordash,\n51 Fedth at 1293 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). A government official\u2019 acts bear \u201csome nexus\nwith furthering federal policy\u201d if he acted within the\nscope of his discretionary authority. Id. at 1294. Simi-\nlarly, a government officials acts could \u201creasonably be\ncharacterized as complying with the fall range of federal\nJaw\u201d ifhis acts complied with the relevant constitutional\nstandard\u2014the Fourth Amendment. Id.\n\nWhen faced with the determination of whether the\nactions a law enforcement officer took comply with the\nFourth Amendment, courts employ an \u201cobjective rea-\nsonableness\u201d standard and consider whether \u201cthe facts\navailable to the officer at the moment of the seizure or\nthe search [make] a [person] of reasonable caution\nbelie(vel that the action taken was appropriate.\u201d Croom\nx.

The gov-\nernment has satisfied both elements of the dseretionary\nfunetion exception. With respect to the frst prong, the\nrecord\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to Appel-\nJants\u2014evinees that Guerra enjoyed discretion in how he\n\n18a\nAppendix A\n\nprepared for the warrant execution. As we previously\nexplained, the FBI did not have stringent policies or\nprocedures in place that dictate Aow agents are to pre-\npare for warrant exeeutions,\n\nFurthermore, the preparatory actions Guerra took\nbefore the warrant execution satisfy the second element\nof the diseretionary funetion exception test. In Mesa v\nUnited States, we explained that a federal officer\u2019s \u201cde-\ncision as to how to locate and identify the subject of an\narrest warrant prior to service of the warrant is suscep-\ntible to poliey analysis.\u201d 123 F:8d 1485, 1438 (11th Cin.\n1997). Although itis unfortunate that despite his prepar-\natory efforts, Guerra exeented the warrant at the wrong\nhouse, his actions, nevertheless, \u201cfall squarely within\nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d Shivers, 1 Fth at\n929,\n\n\u2018The Supremacy Clause bars Appellants\u2019 remaining\nFTCA claims for false imprisonment and assault and\nbattery. The district court initially denied summary\njudgment on Appellants\u2019 false imprisonment and assault,\nand battery claims on grounds that the discretionary\nfanetion exception could not defeat those claims be-\ncause under the FTCA\u2019 private person standard, Geor-\ngia\u2019s citizen's arrest statute does not contemplate the\ngood faith or reasonableness defenses that the govern-\nment asserted. However, on the government\u2019s motion\nfor reconsideration, the district court granted summary\njudgment on those claims, finding that our recent deci-\nsion in Kordash mandates dismissal of those claims.\n\n198\nAppendix A\n\nIn Kordash, we clarified that \u201cthe inquiry that deter-\n\u2018mines if the Supremacy Clause bars state-law liability is\nwhether a federal official's acts \u2018have some nexus with\nfurthering federal policy and ean reasonably be charae-\nterized as complying with the full range of {the Fourth\nAmendment)\u201d 51 Fath at 1283 (quoting Denson, 574\nF.3d at 1348). With respect to the first element, there is\nno doubt that Guerra acted within the seope of his dis-\nceretionary authority when he prepared for and exeeuted\nthe search warrant. The analysis we must conduct to ex-\namine whether Guerra complied with the full range of\nthe Fourth Amendment is the same as the inquiry we\nemployed in the qualified immunity analysis to deter-\nmine whether his actions violated the Fourth Amend-\nment, See id at 1294, As we already explained that\nGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\nthe government has satisfied both elements of the Su:\npremacy Clause analysis. Accordingly, the Supremacy\nClause bars Appellants\u2019 FTCA claims for false impris-\nonment and assault and battery.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment based on\nqualified immunity in favor of Guerra and dismissal of\nthe FTCA claims against the United States on the\ngrounds that the Supremacy Clause and the diseretion-\nary fanetion exception bar those claims.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\nAppendix B\n\nAppendix B\n\nOrder of the United States Distriet Court\nfor the Northern District of Georgia\n\nDecember 30, 2022\n\nala\nAppendix B\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\n\nATLANTA DIVISION\nCURTRINA MARTIN\nPlaintiff,\n.

BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs asserted claims against the United States\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \u201cFTCA\u201d) and\nagainst FBI Special Agent Lawrence Guerra (\u201cGuerra\u201d)\nunder the Fourth Amendment in connection with a war-\nrant that was inadvertently executed at Plaintiffs\u2019\nhome.\n\nOn September 23, 2022, the Court entered an order\ngranting summary judgment to the United States and\nGuerra on Counts III, IV, V and VI of the complaints\nand denying summary judgment as to Counts I and IT\nOrder\u201d), As set forth in the Order, Guerra was dis-\nmissed from the aetion on qualified immunity grounds,\nand certain FTCA claims against the United States re-\nmained.\n\n\u2018The United States seeks reconsideration of the Or-\nder on two grounds. First, it argues that the Eleventh\nCireuit Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in Kordash v. United\n\u2018States, 51 F.Ath 1289 (11th Cir. 2022), which was issued\napproximately one month after this Court issued its Or-\nder, is an intervening development in controlling law\nthat requires dismissal of Plaintifis\u2019 FTCA claims, Sec-\nond, the United States contends that the Court\n\n\u2018urtrina Martin and her child filed a joint complaint, and Hin\n(Catt filed separately. The eases are now consolidated.\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nincorrectly declined to apply certain privileges and im-\n\u2018munities against Plaintiffs\u2019 FTCA claims.\n\nPlaintiffs also seek reconsideration of the Court\u2019s Or-\nder. They assert that the Court misunderstood and\nerred in its assessment of their spoliation argument re-\nlating toa GPS unit Guerra destroyed after the incident.\n\nI. ANALYSIS\n\n\u201cCourts may grant relief under . . . Local Rule 72E\nonly if the moving party clears a high hurdle.\u201d Chesnut\n\ny. Ethan Allen Retail, Inc, 17 \u00a5. Supp. 3d 1367, 1370\n(N.D. Ga, 2014), Indeed, Local Rule 7.2(8) dictates that\n\u201c(motions for reconsideration shall not be filed as a mat-\nter of routine practice\u201d and may be filed only when \u201cab-\nsolutely necessary.\u201d \u201cReeonsiderationis only \u2018absolutely\nnecessary\u2019 where there is: (1) newly discovered evi-\ndence; (2) an intervening development or change in con-\ntrolling lav; or (3) a need to correct a clear error of law\nor fact.\u201d Bryan v. Murphy, 246 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1259\n(ND. Ga. 2008).\n\n\u2018Thus, Local Rule 72E does not afford a dissatisfied\nparty \u201can opportunity to relitigate old matters, raise ar-\ngument or present evidence that could have been raised\nprior to the entry of {the order}, introduce novel legal\ntheories, or repackage familiar arguments to test\nwhether the Court will change its mind.\u201d Chesnut, 7 F.\nSupp. 3d at 1370. In other words, a motion for reconsid-\neration is not \u201can opportunity to show the court how it\n\u201ccould have done it better.\u201d Bryan, 246 F. Supp. 2d at\n1259 (quoting Pres. Endangered Areas of Cobb's\n\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nHistory, Ine. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 916 F.Supp.\n1557, 1560 (N.D. Ga. 1995).\n\n1, Whether the opinion in Kordash is a\ndevelopment in controlling law that\nrequires dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 re-\nmaining FTCA claims\n\n\u2018The United States argues that the Kordash opinion,\nwhich was entered after the Court issued its Order in\nthis ease, is relevant to the question of whether the Su-\npremacy Clause of the United States Constitution bars\nPlaintiffs\u2019 state law claims brought pursuant to the\nFTCA. The United States urges the Court to find that\nit does.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge whether the United States has\ncarried its burden for reconsideration on this ground.\nThey assert that the argument for dismissal of the\nFTCA claims under the Supremacy Clause is not a new\ndevelopment in the law and is rather a \u201cstraightforward\napplication\u201d of the Eleventh Cireuit\u2019s opinion in Denson\nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir. 2009), which\nwas entered more than a decade ago. AS support for\ntheir position, Plaintifts point to the Eleventh Circuit's,\nstatement in Kordash that \u201cthe only difference between\nDenson and [Kordash] is that [the plaintiff in Kordash]\nsplit his claims into two lawsuits instead of joining them\ninto one.\u201d Kordlash, 51 F.Ath at 1294. In short, Plaintifts\nmaintain that the United States had an opportunity to\nraise the Supremaey Clause argument sooner but failed\nto do so, and it eannot offer an argument for the first\ntime in its motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nIn response, the United States argues that the Kor-\ndash opinion represents an intervening development be-\ncause unlike in Denson, the Eleventh Cireuit directly\nstated in Kordash that the first prong of the test to de-\ntermine if the Supremacy Clause applies is satisfied by\nfinding that the official was aeting within the seope of\nhis discretionary authority. The United States also con-\ntends that it could not have raised its Supremacy Clause\nargument sooner or waived it because the argument did\nnot become ripe until the Court granted qualified im-\nmunity to Guerra,\n\n\u2018The Court acknowledges that the United States\ncould have possibly raised its Supremacy Clause argu-\nment earlier. However, Denson is not direetly on point\nhere, and the Kordash opinion does brings [sic] addi-\ntional clarity to the question of whether the Supremacy\nClause bars the FTCA claims under the cireumstances\nof this case, As such, the Court finds that this develop-\n\u2018ment in controlling law warrants reconsideration of the\nOrder.\n\nWith respect to the substantive question of whether\nPlaintiffs\u2019 FTCA claims are barred by the Supremacy\nClause, the Court must decide whether (i) Guerra\u2019s ac-\ntions had \u201csome nexus with furthering federal poliey\";\nand (i) his actions \u201ccan reasonably be characterized as\ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Kordash,\n51 FAth at 1298 (citation omitted). \u201cIf the answer to\nthese questions is yes, application of state law, to the ex-\ntent it unavoidably conflicts with federal law, has no ef-\nfect, as it would frustrate and impede the compelling\n\n26a\n\nAppendix B\nfederal interest of allowing federal officers to effectively\ndischarge their duties.\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1348,\n\nAccording to the opinion in Kordash, the first prong.\nof the analysis is satisfied ifthe official was acting within\nthe seope of his discretionary duty. See Kordash, 51\nFath at 1294, The second prong is satisfied if the offi-\ncial\u2019s actions are found to have complied with the appli-\ncable constitutional standard. See id. These conclusions\ncan be derived from a qualified immunity analysis. See\nid.\n\nHere, the first prong of the Supremaey Clause anal-\nysis is satisfied because, as set forth in the qualified im-\n\u2018munity diseussion of the Court\u2019s Order, Plaintiffs do not\ndispute that Guerra was acting within the seope of his\ndiseretionary authority.\n\nPlaintiffs, however, dispute that the second prong of\nthe testis satisfied.\" They contend that the Court did not\nconclude that Guerra complied with the requirements of\nthe Fourth Amendment because the Court's Order was\nbased only on the second prong of the qualified immun-\nity test, Ze,, whether Guerra violated clearly established\nlaw.\n\nPlaintiffs devive e three-part test from the Kordash opinion, in-\ncluding a requirement that the oficial \u201cacted consstentiy with\npreeminent federal interests of protecting our international bor\n\u2018lers.\" This formulation of the requisite analysis is ineorret and not\n\u2018supported by the Kordashand Denson opinions, The Courts analy\nsisrelies on the two-prong test deseribed in those opinions and eval-\ntates Plaintiff\u2019 arguments as they relate to those prongs\n\n\na\nAppendix B\n\nPlaintiffs are correct that the Court\u2019s conclusion was\nbased on the second prong of the qualified immunity\ntest. The Court found that the law was not clearly estab-\nlished at the time of the incident sueh that Guerra would\nhave known that his actions in this case would be\ndeemed unreasonable and violative of the law.\n\nIn the process of reaching that conclusion, however,\nthe Court expressly considered whether Guerra's ac-\ntions violated the Fourth Amendment. Noting that the\n\u201cultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is rea-\nsonableness,\u201d the Court condueted an extensive analy-\nsis of relevant cases as compared to the facts of this ease\nand ultimately found that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cwere rea-\nsonable under the circumstances.\u201d ECF No, 124 at 21\n\u2018The Court emphasized that Guerra's mistake is not a ba~\nsis to find that he acted unreasonably and in violation of\nthe law. The Court also cited several eases where courts\nhave granted qualified immunity in similar cireum-\nstanees. In all, even though the Court's Order did not\nrest on the first prong of the qualified immunity test\n(whether Guerra violated the Fourth Amendment), the\nCourt explicitly considered this question and found that\nGuerra did not violate the law.\n\nBecause Guerra was acting within the scope of his\ndiseretionary duty, and his actions did not violate the\nFourth Amendment, both prongs of the Supremacy\nClause analysis are satisfied. Accordingly, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bars Plaintiffs\u2019 state law elaims brought pur-\nsuant to the FTCA, and Counts I and IT of the com-\nplaints are dismissed.\n\n28a\nAppendix B\n\nWhether the Court correctly de-\n\nclined to apply certain privileges and\n\nimmunities against Plaintiffs\u2019 FTCA\n\nclaims\n\n\u2018The United States contends that the Court\u2019s rejee-\ntion of certain state law defenses to the FTCA laims\nimproperly creates a strict liability standard for FTCA\nclaims. However, this argument is not based on any of\nthe allowable grounds for reconsideration, It does not\npoint to new evidence, clear error or an intervening\nchange in law. To the contrary, the United States\u2019 dis-\ncussion ofthe issue reflects mere disagreement with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion and simply repackages and extends\nalready rejected arguments to see if the Court will\nchange its mind. Accordingly, reconsideration of this\npoint is not warranted.\u201d\n\n3. Whether the Court Misunderstood\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Spoliation Argument\n\nSection IMC) of Plaintiffs\u2019 brief in opposition to\nsummary judgment is titled \u201cSpoilation [sic].\u201d This sec-\ntion of the brief cites the legal standard for spoliation\nand discusses whether a reasonable faetfinder eould eon-\nclude that Guerra intentionally destroyed the GPS unit\n\u2018on which he states he relied to identify the subject home.\nAs part of this discussion, Plaintiffs explained that they\n\u201chave not yet moved for spoliation sanctions against De~\nfendants because . .. the eritieal question for imposing\n\nIn any event, the United States\u2019 argument is moot given the\nCourts dismistal of the FTCA claims on Supremacy Clause\nrounds\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nsanetions is a factual one for the faetfinder.\u201d ECF No.\n101 at 81 n.18, Plaintiffs farther \u201cpropose(d] that [the\nspoliation] question be posed to the jury via special in-\nterrogatory (if proceeding via jury trial for the Bivens\nclaim) or to the Court (in a FTCA trial)\u201d J In light of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the Court noted in its Order that\nit did not \u201caddress the arguments in the \u2018Spoliation\u2019 sec-\ntion of Plaintiffs\u2019 response brief because, as Defendants\npoint out, Plaintiffs do not request any specifie relief.\u201d\nECF No. 124 at 37 n.16,\n\nPlaintiffs seize on this footnote to argue that the\nCourt did not consider their argument that Guerra\u2019s\nqualified immunity defense should be rejected because\nhe intentionally destroyed the GPS unit.\n\nAs shown above, Plaintiffs did not argue that Guerra\nshould be denied qualified immunity simply based on\nspoliation of evidence. Plaintiffs deseribed their argu-\n\u2018ment opposing Guerra\u2019s qualified immunity defense as\nfollows:\n\nFactual issues preclude summary judgment of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Bivens claim because a jury could find\nGuerra did not engage in any reasonable or mean-\ningful effort to lead the SWAT team to the correct\nhouse beeause he did not do the\n\ndrive-by as he claimed that he did, And Defend-\nant Guerra engaged in spoliation of key evidence\nthat deserves sanetions,\n\nECF No. 101 at 15.\n\n30a\nAppendix B\n\n\u2018The GPS unit was mentioned in Plaintiffs\u2019 briefin the\ncontext of their argument that ifthe unit were available,\nit would show that Guerra did not conduct the Site Sur-\nvey and Drive-by of the location as he asserts and that\nhis preparation to serve the warrant was therefore not\nreasonable. See id. at 15-16. Plaintiffs concluded that the\nquestion of whether Guerra completed these tasks ere-\nated a genuine issue of material fact barring summary\njudgment. See id.\n\n\u2018The Court\u2019s Order specifically addresses this argu-\n\u2018ment and applies an inference that Guerra did not con-\nduet the Site Survey and Drive-by. For example, the\nCourt stated\n\nHere, the Court has reservations regarding\nwhether Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra failed\nto complete the Site Survey and the Drive-By\npresents a genuine dispute of the facts. The evi-\ndence Plaintiffs offer in support of their conten-\ntion requires inferential leaps that are not neces-\nsarily supported by the record,\n\n\u2018To survive summary judgment, Plaintiffs must do\nmore than raise metaphysical doubt regarding\nthe facts, They must produce substantial evi-\ndence demonstrating that there is a genuine issue\nof material fact.\n\nsla\nAppendix B\n\nEven if, for argument\u2019s sake, the Court eredits\nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra did not eonduet\nthe Site Survey and the Drive-By, the record con-\ntains undisputed evidence of several other steps\nthat Guerra took to ascertain and identify the\nhome deseribed in the warrant... These steps\nconstitute considerably more than nothing.\n\u2018The Court considers Guerra\u2019s overall preplanning.\nto constitute significant precautionary measures\nto avoid mistake. The Court further finds that\nthose measures were reasonable under the eir-\ncumstances.\n\nECF No. 124 at 20-21 (citations and quotation marks\nomitted).\n\nInsum, the Court acknowledged and contended with\nthe consequence of the unavailable GPS data and still\nfound that Guerra was entitled to qualified immunity.\nThe only issue the Court did not address is whether\nsanetions should issue for Guerra's destruction of the de-\nvvice\u2014an issue that Plaintiffs, themselves, deferred for a\nlater date,\n\nLike the United States\u2019 argument in section 112)\nabove, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument here appears to be an at-\ntempt to relitigate the underlying conclusion of the\nCourt's Order with the hope that the Court will rule dif-\nferently. That is not a proper basis for a motion for re~\nconsideration. Consequently, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is de-\nnied,\n\n82a\nAppendix B\nIl. CONCLUSION\n\nIn accordance with the Court's analysis herein, the\nCourt GRANTS the United States\u2019 Motion (ECF No.\n188) and DENIES Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion (ECF No. 134). As\na result, Counts I and IT of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints are\nDISMISSED.

ECF\nNo. 88. Having fully considered the papers filed\n\n\n35a\nAppendix C\n\ntherewith and the parties\u2019 oral argument, the Court finds\nas follows:\n\n1. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs Curtvina Martin, Martin\u2019s minor child and\nHilliard Toi Cliatt, IT (collectively \u201cPlaintifis\u201d) asserted\nclaims against the United States under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act (the \u201cFTCA\u201d and against Guerra under the\nFourth Amendment in connection with a warrant that\nwas inadvertently executed at Plaintiffs\u2019 home.\n\nIn 2015, the FBI initiated an operation concerning\nviolent gang activity in Georgia. The operation ulti-\nmately resulted in criminal indictments against thirty\nindividuals, including Joseph Riley (\u201cRiley\u201d). Arrest and\nsearch warrants were thereafter issued for the indiet-\n\n\u2018The FBI prepared an Operation Order, which,\namong other things, provided background information\nregarding the case and instructions on how to execute\nthe warrants. For example, the Operation Order pro-\nvided that seven search warrants and seventeen arrest\nwarrants, including warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and the\nsearch of his home located at 3741 Landau Lane SW, At-\nJanta, Georgia (\u201c3741 Landau\u201d), would be executed sim-\nultaneously on October 18, 2017, at 6:00 a.m,\n\n\u2018The FBI also prepared a SWAT Addendum to the\nOperation Order, which described SWAT-specific\n\n* Curtrina Martin and her child filed a joint complaint, and Hind\nCatt filed separately. The eases are now consolidated.\n\n\n36a\n\nAppendix C\ntactical considerations. The SWAT Addendum in-\nstructed the teams to achieve a near simultaneous exe-\ncution of the warrants to ensure surprise and ineluded\ninformation specifi to the SWAT team, such as breach-\ning the front door and deploying flash bangs.\n\nBasedl on the FBI's determination that Riley posed a\nhigh risk of violence, a SWAT team was designated to\nenter Riley\u2019s home and secure it for other FBI personnel\nto execute the warrants. The SWAT Addendum for 3741\nLandau and Riley included a deseription and photograph\nof the home; an overhead image of the neighborhood\nwith a pin denoting 3741 Landau; step-by-step diree-\ntions to the property with a corresponding map; photo-\ngraphs of Riley; Riley\u2019s physical deseription; and infor-\nmation regarding Riley's alleged history of violence and\ngun possession.\u201d\n\nGuerra was assigned to lead the SWAT Team that\nwould execute the warrants at 3741 Landau, He re-\nceived the names of his SWAT team members as well as\nthe Operation Order and SWAT Addendum.\n\nTo prepare for the warrant exeeutions at 8741 Lan-\ndan, Guerra testified that he conducted a site survey of\n3741 Landau in October 2017 (the \u201cSite Survey\u201d). As\npart of the Site Survey, Guerra states that he noted that\n\nSome of the information inthe SWAT Addendum was gathered by\nFBI Task Force Officer Joshua Thompson (\"Thompson\") during his\nsurvellane of $741 Landan for more than to hours on Oetober 3,\n2021. In addition to diving by the home and dsereetly taking pho-\ntographs of it, Thompson observed the home from aside street us-\ning binoculars\n\n\nSta\nAppendix C\n\nthe residence was a beige split-level home located on a\n\ncorner lot with a large tree; it had a tight stairway and\n\nstoop leading to the front door; and it had windows on\n\neither side that would make taetical entry difficult and\n\nleave agents vulnerable in case of gunfire.\n\nGuerra states that after conducting the Site Survey,\nhe identified a nearby parking lot to be used as a staging\narea for the team executing the 3741 Landau warrants,\nGuerra communicated the location of the staging area to\nthe team via email on October 16, 2017. Guerra also\nwrote tactical notes, which specified the \u201cstack\u201d for-\nmation or order in whieh SWAT team members would\nposition themselves outside the front door and who\nwould breach the door, carry a shield and go upstairs or\ndownstairs upon entry.\n\nOn October 17, 2017, Guerra attended a briefing re-\ngarding the operation, which included a presentation on\nthe warrants to be served on Riley and executed at 3741\nLandau the next day.\n\nGuerra and FBI Special Agent Michael Lemoine\n(\u201cLemoine\u201d) testified that at approximately 3:30 a.m, on\nOctober 18, 2017 (the morning the warrants were to be\nserved), they traveled to 3741 Landau to determine\nwhether any unexpected conditions existed atthe target\nthat could impact the operation (the \u201cDrive-By\u201d). Such\nconditions ineluded evidence that the occupants were\nawake. Guerra testified that it was dark outside, and he\ndimmed his vehicle's headlights to avoid detection, He\nstated that the personal GPS deviee that he used for\nnavigation led him to a home he believed was 8741\n\n\n38a\n\nAppendix C\nLandau, At that home, Guerra testified that he observed\na tan split-level home on a comer lot with a large tree,\nwhich he recalled from his Site Survey. Guerra reported\nthat he noticed the street sign for Landau Lane, a gar-\nage at the side of the home, a stoop in front of the home\nand four windows to the right of the stoop. Guerra and\nLemoine both testified that they observed a black Ca-\nmaro car in the driveway of the home, which Guerra\nnoted as a future reference point. Lemoine and Guerra\ndiscussed that the black Camaro ear was not present at\nthe home during Guerra's previous visit.\u2019\n\nItturns out that Guerra and Lemoine were at Plain-\ntiff\u201d home, located at 3756 Denville Trace SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia (\"3756 Denville\u201d), instead of at 3741 Landau.\nPlaintiff\u2019 home, which also faces Landau Lane, is three\nor four houses down from 8741 Landau. The address of\n\u00a38756 Denville is not affixed to the front of the home or\nanywhere else on the building, It is posted on the mail-\nbox at the end of the driveway on the side of the house\nlocated on Denville Trace.\n\nGuerra testified that he and Lemoine subsequently\nreturned to the staging area to brief the other personnel\nparticipating in the operation. Shortly before 5:00 a.m.,\n\u2018a caravan of federal agents and Atlanta Police Depart-\nment officers left the staging area for 3741 Landau. It\n\u2018was still dark outside, When Guerra arrived at the home\nhe believed to be 3741 Landau, he directed the driver of\nhis vehicle to stop. Guerra was at 3756 Denville, but\n\n\"Riley was not known to operate a black Camaro ear or aesoeate\nwith anyone who di. The SWAT Addendum lsted several other\n\u2018vehicles as associated with Riley, inetudinga white Nissan ear\n\n39a\nAppendix C\n\nneither he nor the other agents realized the error at that\ntime.\n\nOnce the SWAT Team was in place, Guerra states\nthat he knoeked on the door and announced law enforee-\n\u2018ments presence. Plaintiffs were asleep in their bedroom\nand stated that they did not hear the knock. After wait-\ning ten to twenty seconds, Guerra directed an agent to\nbreach the front door. Another agent deployed a flash\nbang. The team entered Plaintiffs\u2019 home at or about 5:00\n\nPlaintiffs hid in their bedroom closet after the agents\nentered the home but were quickly found. The agents\nremoved Cliatt from the closet, dragged him to the bed-\nroom floor and handcuffed him. No agent touched Mar-\ntin,\n\nShortly after agents detained Cliatt, Guerra entered\nthe bedroom and noticed that Cliatt did not have the\nsame tattoos as Riley. Guerra then asked Cliatt to pro-\nvide his name and address. Around that time, Lemoine\nnoticed mail bearing a different address than 3741 Lan-\ndau, Upon realizing that they were in the wrong home,\nthe agents ended the search and uncuffed Cliatt. Guerra\ntold Plaintiffs he would return to explain what hap-\npened. The agents were in the home for no more than\nfive minutes.\n\nAt or about 5:07 a.m., Guerra and the team executed\nthe warrants at 741 Landau, Guerra thereafter re-\nturned to Plaintiffs\u2019 home and apologized for the error.\nHe provided his business card and took photographs of\nthe damage caused by the foreed entry. Guerra also\n\n\n0a,\nAppendix C\n\nprovided the name of the FBI's Chief Division Counsel\nwho would be responsible for the incident.\n\nGuerra testified that he stopped using his personal\nGPS device after the incident, and he threw it away not\nJong after that. The device was therefore not available\nfor Plaintiffs\u2019 inspection during discovery or for corrob-\noration of Guerra's testimony.\n\n\u2018The FBI\u2019sagency representative testified that when\npreparing to execute a gang-related warrant, an FBI\nagent typically conducts a site survey of the target loca-\ntion to the extent feasible. However, no FBI poliey or\nprocedure dictates how to locate or navigate to the tar-\nget, whether to use a GPS device or what type of GPS\ndevice must be used, whether or how to eonduet a site\nsurvey or drive-by of a target location or how long to\nwait before entering after knocking and announcing.\n\u2018These decisions are left to the personnel involved in the\nspecific operation,\n\nPlaintiffs dispute several facts relating to Guerra\u2019s\npreparation to serve and execute the warrants. They as-\nsert that the absence of corroborating geo location and\nmeta data raises questions regarding the veracity of\nGuerra's testimony that he completed the Site Survey\nand the Drive-By. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge that:\n( GPS data is not available for Guerra's device at the\ntime he states he completed the Site Survey and the\nDrive-By but is available for the hours following the ex-\necution of the warrants; (i) available geo location data\nfor Lemoine\u2019s device ealls into question whether he par-\nticipated in the Drive-By; (ii) no metadata is available\n\nAla\nAppendix C\n\nfor the photographs that Guerra asserts he took of 8741\nLandau during his Site Survey; (iv) Guerra and FBI\nAgent Gregory Donovan (\u201cDonovan\u201d) initially testified\nthat they condueted the Site Survey together, but geo\nlocation data from Donovan's cellular telephone indi-\ncates that he did not visit 3741 Landau during the rele-\nvant period; and (v) Guerra disposed of his personal GPS\ndevice after the incident, even though he gave Plaintiffs\nthe contact information for the Chief Division Counsel\nand should have anticipated that there could be litiga-\ntion regarding the incident. Plaintiffs conclude that a\nreasonable juror could determine, based on these facts,\nthat Guerra did not conduet the Site Survey or Drive-\nBy prior to executing the warrants.\n\nDefendants respond that Guerra's testimony regard-\ning the Site Survey and Drive-By is corroborated by\nphotographs of the home that only Guerra testified to\nhhave taken; an October 16, 2017 e-mail from Guerra to\nthe team identifying the staging area, which Guerra as-\nserts he identified as part of the Site Survey; and\nGuerra\u2019s tactical notes written prior to the execution of,\nthe warrant and reportedly based on the Site Survey.\n\nDefendants further explain that the FBI was unable\nto find geo location data for seven of the sixteen FBI\npersonnel who participated in the warrant executions\nand that there is no evidence that such data was de-\nstroyed or withheld from Plaintiffs. Defendants also ar-\ngue that geo location data that is available for Lemoine\u2019s\ndevice shows that he arrived at the staging area at ap-\nproximately 3:26 a.m. on the morning of October 17 and\nthat he left the staging area between 3:31 a.m. and 3:42\n\nBa\n\nAppendix C\nam., which would have been sufficient time for Guerra\nand Lemoine to complete the Drive-By and return to the\nstaging area.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants assert that Guerra exe-\ncuted the declaration in this ease more than two years\nafter the Site Survey, and at that time, both he and Do-\nnovan believed that they had conducted the Site Survey\ntogether in accordance with their common practice, De-\nfendants explain that after they learned that geo loca-\ntion data indicated that Donovan was not present at the\nSite Survey, both agents corrected the declaration tes-\ntimony during their depositions,\n\nDefendants also contend that FBI policy did not re-\nquire Guerra to preserve his personal GPS unit, and the\nobligation to preserve the unit materialized only when\nthe unit became diseoverable in litigation. Defendants\n\u2018maintain that Guerra provided the Chief Division Coun-\nsel\u2019s contact information to Plaintiffs to facilitate reim-\nbbursement for the damage to Plaintiffs\u2019 home and not\nbecause Guerra believed litigation would arise from the\nincident.\n\nI. ANALYSIS\nA. Legal Standard\n\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the record\n\nevidence, including depositions, sworn declarations, and\nother materials, shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\n\u201cThe record does not show where Lemoine went, and data is not\navailable for his device between 243 am. and 4:8 am.\n\n48a\nAppendix C\n\nfas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\" Feliciano v. City of Miami\n\u2018Beach, 107 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56) (quotation marks omitted).

Ultimately, \u201c{t]he\nbasie issue before the court... is \u2018whether the evidence\npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submis-\nsion to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party\n\u2018must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d Allen, 121 F.3d at 646\ncitation omitted).\n\n\u2018The party moving for summary judgment bears the\ninitial burden of showing that no geniuine issue exists as\nto any material fact. See id. \u201cin deciding whether the\nmovant has met this burden(,] the court must view the\nmovant\u2019s evidence and all factual inferences arising from\nit in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d\nMd.\n\nAfter the movant satisfies this initial burden, the\nnonmovant bears the burden of showing specific facts in-\ndicating summary judgment is improper because a ma~\nterial issue of fact does exist.

Qualified Immunity\n\n\u2018The doctrine of qualified immunity protects govern-\n\u2018ment officials from civil liability for actions taken within\nthe scope of their discretionary authority unless their\nconduet violated a plaintiff's federal constitutional\nrights as demonstrated by clearly established law. See\nHarbert Int, Ine. v. James, 151 F.3d 1271, 1281 (11th\nCir. 1998). \u201cThe defense of qualified immunity aims to\nstrike a balance between \u2018the need to hold publi officials\naccountable when they exercise power irresponsibly\nand the need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Taylor v. Taylor, 649 F. App\u2019s 731, 742 (11th\nCir. 2016), Thus, the doctrine \u201cgives government off-\ncials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken\njudgments, and \u2018protects all but the plainly incompetent,\nor those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d\n\n\n45a\nAppendix C\n\nMesserschmidt v. Millender, 65 U.S. 585, 546 (2012)\n(quoting Asheroftv. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 748 2011).\n\n\u2018The burden is on the defendant to raise the qualified\nimmunity defense. See Lewis v. City of W. Palm Beach,\n561 F.3d 1288, 1201 (11th Cir. 2009). Once the defendant\ndoes so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that\nqualified immunity should not apply. See id.\n\nCourts in the Eleventh Cireuit \u201cconduet a two-step\ninquiry to decide whether qualified immunity should be\ngranted: (1) taken in the light most favorable to the\nparty asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the\nofficer's conduct violated a constitutional right{?]; and\n)if'a constitutional right would have been violated wn-\nder the plaintif?'s version of the facts, ... [was] the right\n=. clearly established(?)\" Shuford v. Conway, 666 F.\nApp'x 811, 815 (11th Cir. 2016),\n\n\u201cBoth elements must be satisfied for an official to\nlose qualified immunity.\u201d Fis v. City of Aventura, 647\nF.3d 1272, 1287 (11th Gir. 2011) (tation omitted). How-\never, \u201cthe two steps do not have to be analyzed sequen-\ntially.\u201d Za. If the law was not clearly established at the\ntime ofthe incident, the court need not decide ifthe de-\nfendant actually violated the plaintiff's rights. See id;\nMaughon v. City of Covington, 505 F. App's 818, 821\n(Lith Gir. 2013) (stating that \u201cthe court] need not con-\nduct {the} qualified immunity analysis in any specific o-\nder; rather, (the court is} permitted to exercise [its]\nsound diseretion in deciding which prong of [the] inquiry\ntoaddress first\u201d),\n\n\n6a\n\nAppendix C\n\nWith these principles in mind, the Court turns to the\nsubstance of Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim\nagainst Guerra.\n\nDefendants contend that Plaintis\u2019 Fourth Amend-\n\u2018ment claims should be dismissed on qualified immunity\ngrounds because Guerra was acting within the seope of\nhis discretionary authority, and Plaintiffs have failed to\nshow that the alleged constitutional right was clearly es-\ntablished at the time of the incident. Since Plaintfis do\nnot dispute that Guerra was acting within the scope of\nhis diseretionary authority,\u201d the burden shifts to Plain-\ntiffs to show that qualified immunity is inappropriate\nhere. See Lewis, 561 F.3d at 1291, To evaluate whether\nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden in this regard, the\nCourt turns first to the second prong of the qualified im-\nmunity test (clearly established law).\n\nEven where an officer is found to have violated a\nplaintiff's Fourth Amendment right, the doctrine of\n\u2018qualified immunity bars recovery unless the plaintiff ean\nshow that the violated right was clearly established at\nthe time of the incident. See Smith v. LePage, SU F.3d\n1285, 1297 (11th Cir. 2016). Thus, the plaintiff must show\nthat at the time ofthe officer's conduct, the law was clear\nsuch that every reasonable official would have under-\nstood that the conduct would be unlawful under the eir-\ncumstances. See District of Columbia v. Weshy, 138 S.\nCt. 577, 589 (2018). In other words, \u201cexisting law must\nhave placed the constitutionality of the officer's conduct\n\n\u2018The only diseussion of discretion in Paint brief relates to thelr\nangument that the discretionary function exception does not bar\ntheir claims under the PTC\n\n\nMa\n\nAppendix C\nbeyond debate, This demanding standard protects all\nbut the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nlate the law.\u201d Za (internal citation and punctuation\nomitted).\n\n\u2018To that end, the Supreme Court of the United States\nhas \u201crepeatedly stressed that courts must not \u201cdefine\nclearly established law at a high level of generality, since\ndoing so avoids the crucial question [of] whether the of-\nficial acted reasonably in the particular cireumstances\nthat he or she faced.\u201d Za. at 590 (citation omitted). \u201cIt is\nnot enough that the rule is suggested by then-existing\nprecedent. The precedent must be elear enough that\nevery reasonable official would interpret it to establish\nthe particular rule the plaintiff seeks to apply.\u201d Jd.\n\nA plaintiff demonstrates the requisite rule by citing\n\u201c(1) case law with indistinguishable facts clearly estab-\nlishing the constitutional right; 2) a broad statement of\nprinciple within the Constitution, statute, or ease law\nthat clearly establishes a constitutional right; oF (3) eon-\nduct so egregious that a constitutional right was clearly\nviolated, even in the total absence of ease law.\"\" See\n\u2018Smith, 834 F 3d at 1297 (citation omitted), When relying\non ease law, a \u201cclose factual fit between the pre-existing\ncase and the present one is essential,\u201d and \u201c[gleneral\n\n* Only binding provedent\u2014decisions of the Supreme Court the\nEleventh Cireait or the highest court ofthe state\u2014can establish a\nconstitutional right beyond debate, See Eeholsw: Lawton, 913 F2\n1313, 1824 11th Ci 2019), However, \u201cnon-binding persuasive au\nthority ean be used to indicate that a particular constitutional right\nis notelearly established.\u201d Corbitt Vickers, 929 Pid 1304, 1319 n\n1M (lth Cir: 2018) (emphasis added,\n\n\n48a\nAppendix C\n\npropositions from earlier decisions will not do.\u201d Cantu v.\n\nGity of Dothan, 914 F 3d 1217, 1232 (11th Cir. 2020). The\n\nkey is whether the law gave the defendant \u201cfair warn-\n\ning\u201d at the time he engaged in the conduet that his ac-\n\ntions were unconstitutional. Id.\n\nHere, Plaintiffs point to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\nin Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S.79 (1987) and the Elev-\nenth Cireuit\u2019s decision in Hartsffeld v. Lemacks, 50 F.3d\n950 (11th Cir. 1995) as clearly establishing that Guerra\u2019s\nactions in this ease violated Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amend-\nment rights. In Garrison, police officers executed a\nsearch warrant on a home described as occupying the\n\u201cthird floor\u201d of an apartment building, 480 U.S. at 81. Af-\nter the police officers began searching the plaintiff's\napartment, which was located on the third floor of the\nbuilding, they realized that there were two apartments\n\u2018on the floor and that they had entered the wrong home.\nId. at 86-87. They diseontinued the seareh at that point.\nTd. at 81.\n\nIn analyzing the cage, the Supreme Court \u201crecognized\nthe need toallow some latitude for honest mistakes that\nare made by officers in the dangerous and difficult pro-\ncess of making arrests and executing search warrants.\u201d\nJd. The Supreme Court noted, among other things, that\nthe officer who obtained the warrant had verified the in-\nformation obtained from a reliable informant, examined\nthe exterior of the building and sought information from\nthe utility company serving that address. /\u00a2, at 81. Ult\n\nmately, the Court found that because the \u201cobjective\nfacts available to the officers at the time suggested no\ndistinction between the plaintiff's apartment and the\n\n49a\nAppendix C\n\ntarget\u2019s apartment,\u201d the officers\u2019 search did not violate\nthe plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights. Jd. at 88\n\nAt issue in Hartsfield was whether an officer's mis-\ntake in serving a warrant on the wrong home was rea-\nsonable where (i) he did not verify that he was leading\nthe other officers to the correct address as listed on the\nwarrant; (ii) he did not perform any \u201cprecautionary\nmeasures\u201d to avoid the mistake; (ii) the raid took place\nduring the day, and the numbers on the houses were\nclearly marked; and (iv) the plaintiff's and the target's\nhomes had distinguishable features and were located on\ndifferent parts of the street, separated by at least one\nother residence, 50 F.3d at 955, The Eleventh Cireuit ex-\nplained that because the officer \u201cdid nothing\u2019 to make\nsure that he was leading the other officers to the correct\nresidence,\u201d he was not protected by the doctrine of qual-\niffed immunity. 24. (emphasis added). Also important to\nthe court were the faets that the officer had visited the\ncorrect residence the day before the search and had ob-\ntained the search warrant based on his own observa-\ntions of a drug transaction at the home. Zd. The court\nemphasized that the officer\u2019s actions \u201cwere simply not\n\u2018consistent with a reasonable effort to ascertain and\nidentify the place intended to be searched.\u201d Za. (citing\nGarrison, 480 U.S. at 88-89). The court concluded that it\n\u2018was \u201cclearly established law that, absent probable cause\nand exigent cireumstances, a warrantless search of a\nresidence violates the Fourth Amendment, unless the\nofficers engage in reasonable efforts to avoid error.\u201d Jd.\n\n\u2018The foregoing cases demonstrate that a central issue\nin determining whether the doctrine of qualified\n\n5a\nAppendix C\n\nimmunity applies in a Fourth Amendment seareh war-\nrant eae is where to draw the line between reasonable\nand unreasonable measures taken to avoid error. To as-\nsist in this inquiry, the Eleventh Cireuit has eautioned\nthat \u201cInJone of its} precedents holds\u2014or logically com-\npels the conelusion\u2014that an offieer\u2019s well-intentioned\nattempts to ascertain and identify the property de-\nseribed in @ warrant are [unreasonable simply beeause\nthey lead to an error, or beeause more accurate means\nof ascertaining the property's identity were available.\u201d\nWhite v. Melain, 648 F. App'x 838, 841 (11th Cir, 2016).\nIndeed, \u201c{t]o he reasonable isnot to be perfect, and so\nthe Fourth Amendment allows for some mistakes on the\npart of government officials, giving them \u2018fair leeway for\nenforcing the law in the community's protection.\u201d Heien\nv. North Carolina, 574 US. 54, 60-61 2014) (quoting\nBrinogar v. United States, 888 U.S. 160, 176 (1949).\n\nBased on these prineiples, the court in White found\nthat an officer who \u201cdid attempt to ascertain and verify\nthat he had the right house,\u201d including by revisiting the\nblock where the house was located and taking: a photo-\ngraph of what he thought was the correet house, was\nprotected by the doctrine of quality [sie] immunity.\nWhite, 648 F. App's at 842-48, That court diseussed the\nEleventh Cireuit\u2019s prior opinion in Hartsfield and disa-\ngreed that that opinion stood for the proposition \u201cthat\nan officer who attempts to ascertain and verify the iden-\ntity of the place to be searched violates the Fourth\nAmendment if he fails to do everything possible to en-\nsure that he is nat mistaken.\u201d White, 648 F. App'x at 843.\nTo the contrary, the court focused on the steps the of-\nficer took in preparing to serve the warrant to\n\nBla\nAppendix C\n\ndetermine whether the officer\u2019s aetions were reasonable\nand passed muster. See ick see also Norris v. Hicks, 855\nF. App'x 515, 523-24 (11th Cir. 2021) (finding that offic-\ners who carefully planned a high-risk raid at the home of\na dangerous person were entitled to qualified immunity\nwhere they encountered unexpected circumstances that\nresulted in the warrant being executed at the wrong\nhome).\n\nHere, the Court has reservations regarding whether\nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra failed to complete the\nSite Survey and the Drive-By presents a genuine dis-\npute of the facts. The evidenee Plaintiffs offer in support\nof their contention requires inferential leaps that are not\nnecessarily supported by the record. For example, miss-\ning geolocation data for the morning of the Drive-By\ndoes not necessarily mean that the Drive-By did not oc-\ncur, especially in light of the eorroborating deposition\ntestimony of Lemoine that the Drive-By did oceur. To\nsurvive summary judgment, Plaintiffs must do more\nthan raise \u201cmetaphysical doubt\" regarding the facts.\nGareaynski, 573 F.3d at 1165 (citation omitted). They\n\u2018must produce substantial evidence demonstrating that\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact. See id.\n\nEvenif, forargument\u2019s sake, the Court eredits Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra did not conduct the Site Sur-\nvey and the Drive-By, the record contains undisputed\nevidence of several other steps that Guerra took to \u201cas-\ncertain and identify\u201d the home described in the warrant,\nWhite, 648 F. App\u2019x at 841. Guerra reviewed the Oper-\nation Order and Swat Addendum; he attended an oper-\national briefing; and he selected a staging area and made\n\n\n52a\nAppendix C\n\ntactical notes with knowledge and in consideration of the\nlocation of the home. These steps constitute considera-\nbly more than \u201cnothing.\u201d Hartsfield, 50 F.3d at 955. The\nrecord also contains evidence of detailed planning by\nother agents, including Agent Thompson's surveillance\nof 8741 Landau, upon which Guerra relied. The Court\nconsiders Guerra\u2019s overall preplanning to constitute sig-\nnificant \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d to avoid mistake. fd.\n\u2018The Court further finds that those measures were rea-\nsonable under the circumstances, See Heien, 574 U.S. at\n60 (noting that the Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly af-\nfirmed\u201d that \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is reasonableness\u201d) (citation and punetua-\ntion marks omitted),\n\nMoreover, the execution of the warrant occurred in\nthe dark, and the house number was not affixed any-\nwhere on the house. It was listed on a mailbox at the end\nof the driveway on another street, and Plaintiffs agreed\nduring oral argument that checking the mailbox at that\nlocation in the midst of executing the warrant would\nhhave caused some delay in the operation. Such delay\ncould have been problematie because the warrant was\nbeing served on a dangerous individual under the cover\nof darkness, and the simultaneous execution of multiple\nrelated warrants was important to the overall operation.\n\nWhile, as Plaintifts point out, 3741 Landau and 3756\nDenville were dissimilar in some respeets and were sep-\narated by three or four homes, Plaintiffs do not dispute\nthat the two homes shared several conspicuous features,\nincluding a corner lot with a large tree and a tight stair-\nway leading to the front door. In all, itis not the role of\n\n58a\nAppendix C\n\nthe Court (and, indeed, the Court is ill-equipped) to play\n\nMonday morning quarterback and dictate what addi-\n\ntional steps Guerra should have taken in the universe of\nmeasures available to hin\n\nThat Guerra\u2019s efforts were ineffectual is not a basis\nto find that he acted unreasonably and in violation of the\nlaw. The Supreme Court emphasized in Messersehmide\nthat the doctrine of qualified immunity \u201cprotects all but\nthe plainly ineompetent or those who knowingly violate\nthe law.\u201d Messersehmiat, 565 U.S. at 546 (citation omit-\nted). The Court eannot conclude based on the record be-\nfore it that Guerra was either incompetent or that he\nknowingly broke the law. To the contrary, the record\nsupports the conclusion that Guerra simply made a mis-\ntake\u2014based on reasonable but mistaken judgment.\nGuerra\u2019s actions are therefore excused under the law.\n\u2018See idk Heien, 574 US. at 60-61 (stating that the Fourth\nAmendment allows leeway for mistakes by government\nofficials).\n\nImportantly, courts have granted immunity in cases\nthat reflect preparations similar to the steps Guerra un-\ndertook in this ease or for operations similar to the one\nat issue here. See, eg, Norris, 855 F. App'x at 523-24;\nWhite, 648 P, App's at 42-43; eff Hartsfield, 50 F'3d at\n955. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the law was\nnot clearly established at the time of the incident that\nGuerra's preparatory steps would be insufficient or that\nthey would otherwise be deemed unreasonable and vio-\nlative of the law. In other words, Guerra\u2019s actions did\nnot violate clearly established lave, and he is therefore\nentitled to qualified immunity against Plaintiffs claims.\n\nBla\nAppendix C\n\u00a9. Federal Torts [sic] Claims Act\n\nUnder the FTCA, the United States waived immun-\nity for claims related to an injury\n\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omis-\nsion of any employee of the Government while\nacting within the scope of his office or employ~\nment, under circumstances where the United\nStates, ifa private person, would be liable to the\nclaimant in aecordanee with the law of the place\nwhere the act or omission occurred.\n\n28 USC. \u00a7 1346(0)(1). Thus, the FTCA \u201csimply allows\nthose injured by the acts or omissions of a government\nemployee to recover damages in the same way that they\nwould if they were injured by the acts or omissions of a\nprivate person.\u201d Smith v. United States, 14 Fath 1228,\n1282 (11th Cir, 2021). This means that a plaintiff must\nshow that a private person would be liable for the act or\nomission under state law. \u201cIa plaintiff fails to establish\nthat state-law duty, ...the United States retains its sov-\nreign immunity and the suit eannot go forward.\u201d Id.\n\n1 The\ntion\n\nceretionary Funetion Excep-\n\n\u2018The waiver of immunity under the FTCA is not ab-\nsolute. For example, it does not extend to \u201cthe failure to\nexercise or perform adiseretionary funetion or duty ...,\nwhether or not the diseretion involved be abused.\u201d 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2680(2). This earve out is commonly referred to\nas the discretionary function exception to the FTCA.\n\u2018See, e.g, Foster Logging, Ine. v. United States, 973 F.3d\n\n\nAppendix C\n1152, 1157 (11th Cir, 2020), \u201c(T]he purpose of the exeep-\ntion is to prevent judicial second-guessing of legislative\nand administrative decisions grounded in social, eco-\nnomic, and political poliey through the medium of an ac-\ntion in tort.\u201d United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323\n(1991) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\nA-court\u2019s analysis of whether the diseretionary fune-\ntion exception applies involves a two-part test:\n\nFirst, a court examines the nature of the chal-\nlenged conduct or act to determine whether it is\n\u201c<diseretionary in nature,\u201d meaning that it ine\nvolves \u201can element of judgment ar choice.\u201d Sec-\nond, ifthe challenged conduet involves an element\nof judgment or choice, a court then determines\n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the\ndiscretionary function exception was designed to\nshield.\u201d\n\nFoster, 973 F.3d at 1157 (citations omitted).\n\nThe first prong of the test focuses on \u201cwhether the\ncontrolling statute or regulation mandates that a gow-\nernment agent perform his or her funetion ina speeifie\nmanner.\u201d 1d. at 1158 (quoting Hughes v. United States,\n110 F.34 765, 768 (1th Cir. 1997). If it \u201cspecifically pre-\nscribes a course of action for an employee to follow,\nthere is no judgment or choice involved.\u201d fd at 1157 (ek.\ntation and quotation marks omitted), Ifit does not, the\ncourt will \u2018presume(] that the particular aet involved an\nelement of judgment or choice.\u201d Zelaya v. United States,\n781 F.bd 1315, 1880 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Aucery v\nUnited States, 992 F 2A 1523, 1529 (11th Cir. 1998)\n\n\n5a\nAppendix C\n\nUnder the second prong of the test, \u201ca particular\ndecision will be of the kind proteeted by the exception if\nitis the type of decision that one would expeet to be in-\nherently grounded in considerations of poliey.\u201d Zelaya,\n781 F.3d at 1330, However, \u201cwhen a government agent\nis permitted to exereise diseretion in making a partieu-\nJar decision\u2014whether that permission is express or im-\nplied\u2014it mast be presumed that the agent\u2019s aets are\ngrounded in poliey when exercising that diseretion.\u201d Jd.\n(citing Gaudert, 499 US. at 324).\n\nIn the context of a law enforcement official serving\nan arrest warrant, the Eleventh Cireuit has \u201ccon\nclude{d} that the investigation of the whereabouts and\nidentity of the subject of an arrest warrant prior to ser-\nvice of the arrest warrant is conduct that falls within the\ndiscretionary function exception.\u201d Mesa v. United\n\u2018States, 123 F.3d 1485, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997). With re-\nspect to the first prong of the test, the court \u201creadily\u201d\nfound that \u201cdecisions regarding, how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u201d involve \u201can ele-\n\u2018ment of judgment or choice.\u201d fd.\n\nWith respect to the second prong of the test, the\nMesa court explained that,\n\n[tdhe decision as to how to locate and identify the\nsubject of an arrest warrant prior to service of the\nwarrant is susceptible to policy analysis. For ex-\nample, in deciding how extensively to investigate\nthe location and identity of the subject, agents\nmay weigh the urgeney of apprehending the sub-\nject in light of such factors as the potential threat\n\nBta\n\nAppendix C\nthe subject poses to public safety and the likeli-\nhood that the subject may destroy evidence. A de-\nsire to keep the investigation secret\u2014for tactical\nreasons, to protect confidential sources, to protect.\nthe agents involved, or for other reasons\u2014may_\nalso factor into the decision as to how to locate and\nidentify the subject of a warrant. In addition,\nagents may consider their available resources and\ndecide how to allocate those resourees among the\nmany investigations for which they are responsi-\nble. All of these factors indicate that the decision\nregarding how to locate and identify the subject\nof an arrest warrant is fundamentally rooted in\npolicy considerations, and that judicial second-\nguessing of this decision thus is not appropriate.\n\nId, See also Vivas v. United States, No. 1:20-CV-02217,\n2021 WL 2582300, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 21, 2021) (stating\nthat \u201cdecisions made by ... officers in determining how\nand where to locate the subject of the warrant [served\nat the wrong home] are covered by the diseretionary\nfunetion exception\u201d).\n\nApplying the principles set forth in Zelayaand Mesa\nhere, this Court finds that Guerra's efforts in preparing\nto execute the warrant at 8741 Landau involved judg-\nment and choice, There was no statute, regulation or\neven internal operating procedure prescribing Guerra\u2019s\ncourse of action. To the contrary, Guerra\u2019s actions in-\nvolved multiple independent decisions regarding how to\ninvestigate the location where the warrant was to be\nserved and direct the team in executing the warrant. As\nexplained in Mesa, these decisions involve policy\n\n58a\nAppendix C\n\nconsiderations and should not be subject to judicial see-\nond-guessing.\n\n\u2018The Court is not convinced by Plaintiffs\u2019 argument\nthat Guerra lacked diseretion in executing the search\nwarrant because the warrant identified a specific loca-\ntion. While itis true that the warrant named 8741 Lan-\ndau as the place of execution, and the warrant therefore\ncould not be served at another location, it is also true\nthat Guerra had to make numerous decisions regarding\nhowto execute the warrant. This is the epitome of dis-\ncretion.\n\n\u2018The Court is likewise not persuaded by Plaintiffs\u2019 at-\ntempt to distinguish the Mesa opinion from the facts of\nthis ease. Plaintiffs argue that Mesa involved only an ar-\nrest warrant, and the opinion was therefore limited to\nthat narrow cireumstanee. However, the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit did not expressly limit its opinion in that way, and\nits general discussion of the decision-making process to\ninvestigate the location of a subject is relevant here. See\nMesa, 123 F 34d at 1438. As such, the Mesa opinion is ap-\nposite.\n\nForthese reasons, the Court concludes that Guerra's\nactions are covered under the discretionary function ex-\nception to the PTCA. This means that the Court lacks\njurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims unless they\nare permitted by another provision of the FTCA.\n\n\u2018Pains noted that they wish to preserve for appeal their argu-\nrent thatthe diseretionary function exception should not apply to\nViolations of constitutional rights. However, as Plintifs eonced,\n\n5a\nAppendix C\n2. The Law Enforeement Proviso\n\nUnder \u00a7 2680(h) of the FTCA, the United States ex-\npressly declined to waive immunity for specific claims,\nincluding those arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment and false arrest. However, this exception\ndoes not apply to Ge, immunity is waived for) six inten-\ntional torts where they concern aets or omissions of \u201cin-\nvestigative or law enforcement officers of the United\nStates Government.\u201d Jd. The six enumerated torts for\nwhich immunity is waived are assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process and malicious\nprosecution, Jd. This earve out for actions arising out of\nthe conduct of law enforcement is known as the law en-\nforcement proviso. See Millbrook v. United States, 969\nU.S. 50, 58-58 (2013). The law enforcement proviso ap-\nplies regardless of whether the diseretionary function\nexception would otherwise deny jurisdiction over the\nclaims, See, e.g, Williums v. United States, 314 F, App\u2019s\n258, 258-59 (11th Cir. 2009) (stating that the law en-\nforcement proviso \u201cwaives sovereign immunity for bat-\ntery claims against federal law enforcement offteals, in-\ncluding battery claims arising out of those aets or omis-\nsions that fulfill a diseretionary funetion\u201d)..\n\nthe Eleventh Cireuit recently rejected that argument in Shivers\nUnited States, 1 Fath 24 (1th Cx. 2021,\n\n* For purposes of this provision, \u201ca law enforcement officer i any\nciter of the United States who is empovtered by la to execute\n\u2018searches, to seize evidence, oF to make arrests Tor violations of fed\ntral lav\u201d Willams x: United States, 314 P.

The\nclaims for false arrest, false imprisonment and assault\nand battery clearly fall under the law enforcement pro-\nviso.\u201d Therefore, those claims survive, despite the\nCourt\u2019s finding herein that they are exeluded by the dis-\ncretionary function exception. The remaining claims\u2014\nfor trespass, interference with private property, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress and neg-\nligence\u2014are not covered by the law enforcement pro-\nviso and therefore remain excluded. Consequently, the\nCourt lacks jurisdietion as to Counts III, IV and V of,\neach complaint, and the United States. entitled to sum-\nmary judgment on those claims. The Court has jurisdie-\ntion as to Counts and I of the complaints and will now\nconsider the merits of those claims.\n\n3. Merits of the Claims\n\nAAs set forth above, the United States ean be liable\nunder the FTCA only to the extent thata private person\n\u2018would be liable under the law of the place where the in-\ncident occurred. Seo28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346()(). Since the in-\ncident occurred in Georgia, the Court must apply the\nlaw of Georgia as it pertains to liability ofa private per-\nson under the facts of this ease. See Smith, 14 Fath at\n1282,\n\n\"The parties donot dispute that Guerra law enforcement officer\nofthe United States Government\n\n6la\nAppendix C\n\n& Count I (Palse Arrest/Impris-\nonment)\n\nUnder Georgia law, a false arrest is an \u201carrest under\nprocess of law, without probable cause, when made ma-\nliciously.\u201d 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-1.

(citation, alterations and quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n62a\nAppendix C\n\nHere, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have a\nfalse arrest claim because the arrest did not invalve a\nwarrant. They contend that Plaintiffs may assert only a\nfalse imprisonment claim, Defendants urge the Court to\ngrant summary judgment on Plaintifls\u2019 false imprison-\n\u2018ment claim on the grounds that Guerra acted in good\nfaith, Although Defendants acknowledge that the issue\nof good faith is typically a fuct question, they contend\nthat they should prevail in this ease because the record\nis clear that no agent acted in bad faith,\n\nPlaintiffs respond that the most analogous law appli-\ncable to private persons is Georgia's citizen's arrest\nlaw.\" Under that statute, \u201c(al private person may arrest\nan offender if the offense is committed in his presence or\nwithin his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a fel-\nony and the offender is escaping or attempting to es-\ncape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable\nand probable grounds of suspicion.\u201d 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-4460.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that summary judgment is inappro-\npriate here because Defendants cannot show that the ar-\nrest was proper under the citizen's arrest statute. They\npoint out that Plaintiffs did not commit an offense in De-\nfendants\u2019 presence, and they were not attempting to flee\nat the time Defendants entered their home.\n\nPlaintiffs farther contend that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-21,\nwhich Defendants cite as a basis for their good faith de-\nfense, applies only to law enforcement officers serving a\nwarrant. Thus, Plaintiffs assert that the statute is not\n\n\u2018The etien\u2019s arrest law was in effect at the time of the incident\nbout has sine heen repealed,\n\n63a\nAppendix C\n\napplicable to an FTCA claim, which requires a private\nperson analog law. Plaintiffs also argue that, in any\nevent, the record does not support a good faith defense\nbecause Guerra did not exereise ordinary eare in exeeut-\ning the warrant.\n\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants\nwaived their good faith defense. Plaintifils maintain that\nDefendants may not raise a good faith defense at the\nsummary judgment stage because they did not include\nthe defense in their answer.\n\n\u2018The Court agrees with Defendants that the record\ndoes not support a false arrest claim because the arrest\nin this ease was not executed pursuant to a warrant that\nnamed Plaintiffs. See Ferrell, 672 8.B.2d at 10 (empha-\nsizing that a false arrest claim is improper where there\nis no arrest warrant). The Court, however, disagrees\nthat summary judgment is proper on Plaintiffs\u2019 false im-\nprisonment claim,\n\nFirst, itisnot clear that the good faith defense, which\nconstitutes Defendants\u2019 primary argument for summary\nJudgment, applies here. 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-21, whieh De-\nfendants ite as support for their good faith defense,\nprovides that \u201cfilf imprisonment is by virtue of a war\nrant, neither the party who procured the warrant in\ngood faith nor the officer who executed the warrant in\ngood faith shall be liable for false imprisonment even if\nthe warrant is defective in form or is void for lack of ju-\nrisdition.\u201d Thus, on its face, the statute relates to a law\nenforcement officer serving a warrant, not to an officer\nexeeuting a warrantless arrest or to a private person\n\n64a\n\n\u201cAppendix C\ndetaining another. Itis therefore doubtful that the stat-\ntate applies in the instant FTCA context, which requires\nthe Court to apply a private person analog law.\"\n\nFurther, the citizen's arrest statute, which Plaintiffs\noffer as the applicable private person analog law, does\nnot appear to contemplate a good faith defense.\" That\nstatute authorizes an arrest if the offense was commit-\nted in the presence of the citizen or was within his im-\nmediate knowledge. See 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-4-60. A citizen\nmay rely on reasonable and probable grounds of suspi-\ncion only in eireumstances that involve a felony and an\noffender who is attempting to escape. See id. Defend-\nants have not cited any ease law or otherwise shown that\n1 good faith defense would generally apply to the eiti-\nzen\u2019s arrest statute or where, as here, Plaintiffs commit-\nted no offense and were not attempting to flee.\n\nFinally, Georgia law appears to preclude a good faith de-\nfense where an arrest without a warrant is \u201cillegal.\u201d Col-\nins, 306 8.B.24 at 391. Collins follows eases like Vlass v.\nMeCrary, 5 8.8.24 63, 65 (Ga. Ct.

Willams, 255 SE-20\n{69 (Ga, 1970), which Defendants eite in support oftheir good fith\nsngument, all involve arrests by law enforcement officers serving\n\u2018warrants and are therefore of questionable relevance here\n\"Defendants do not dispute thatthe citizen's arvest statute isa pri-\nvate person analog law.

Accordingly, the Court denies De-\nfendants\u2019 Motion as to Count I of the complaints.\"\n\nb. Count II (Assault and Bat-\ntery)\n\nIn Georgia, an aseault is \u201cfalny violent injury or ille-\ngal attempt to commit a physical injury upon a person.\u201d\nO.C.G.A. \u00a751-1-14.

The Court, however,\nnotes that Plaintiffs have not shown prejudice from the alleged fai\nlure to rise the defense sooner, Soe Edwards s: Fulton Chty, 5\n. App's $82, 887-88 (11th Ci 2013) (tating that \u201ca defendant does\nnot waive an affirmative defense ifthe eatier omission from re-\nsponsive pleadings doesnot prejudice the plaintiff and fing that\nthe dstriet court properly rejected a claim of waiver where the\nplaintifs had the opportunity to respond tothe defense at summary\njudgment and the subject matter ofthe defense was addressed dur-\ning discover\n\n66,\nAppendix C\n\nsome rule of law.\u201d Jd. \u00a7 51-1-18, The Georgia Court of\nAppeals has emphasized that \u201cthe intent to cause actual\nphysical harm to another is not absolutely essential to\nthe viability of a civil aetion for battery.\u201d Hendricks v.\nS.

Fur-\nther, \u201cany unlawful touching is a physical injury to the\nperson and is actionable.\u201d Jd.\n\nHere, Defendants cite Georgia's self-defense statute\nas justification for their actions. They also argue that the\nuuse of force was reasonable under the citizen's arrest\nstatute, and it was ce minimis,\n\nHowever, the self-defense statute is clearly inappli-\ncable under the facts of this ease. It is undisputed that\nPlaintiffs did not resist arrest or otherwise challenge the\nagents.\n\nLikewise, the cases Defendants cite regarding the\nreasonable or de minimis use of force are inapposite\n\u2018Those cases involve claims under the Fourth Amend-\nrent, where the quantum of force used by officers isrel-\nevant, whereas Georgia law precludes the application of\nthe reasonable or de minimisprineiples in abattery case.\n\u2018See Hendricks, 87 S.B.2d at 594 (stating that a battery\n\u201cmay be accomplished by an unauthorized caress as well\nas by an unauthorized blow\u201d). Defendants also have not,\nshown that a reasonableness or de minimis defense\n\u2018would apply to the assault claim,\n\nFinally, the Wiliams ease, which Defendants cite to\nsupport their argument that the force used in this ease\nwas reasonable, involved an arrest of a fleeing suspect\nfor whom a warrant had been issued. See Williams v.\n\nota\n\nAppendix C\nUnited States, 314 F. App\u2019s 258, 258 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\u2018The circumstances of this ease are quite different.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that\nDefendants are not entitled to summary judgment on\nPlaintiffs\u2019 false imprisonment claim (Count 1) and as-\nsault and battery claims (Count 11).\n\nII. CONCLUSION\n\nIn accordance with the Court\u2019s opinion herein, the\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 Motion (ECF No. 83) as to\nCounts III, IV, V and VI of the complaints and DE~\nNIES the Motion as to Counts I and II.\" Sinee the sole\naccount against Defendant Guerra (Count V1) is dis-\nmissed, the clerk is DIRECTED to terminate Guerra\nfrom this action.\"\n\nIn light of these rulings, the Court finds that this is\nan appropriate time for the parties to mediate this dis-\npute.

And where does that door lead?\nA. To the baleony outside,\nQ. Okay.\n\nAllright. I think that\u2019s enough to orient us because I\nwant to talk about the incident that\u2019s the subject of ~ of\nthe lawsuit.\n\nCan you describe in your own words what happened?\nA. The entire incident?\n\nQ Yes.\n\nA. Sure.\n\nAt what part do you want me to start at? When I was\nasleep? Before I got home? When ~~ when ~ when ~\nwhat \u2014where do you have me start?\n\nQ. Let's ~ let's start at before you got home. What\nare you referring to there?\n\nA. Before I got home, I was coming home from\nDurham, North Carolina. T had basieally parked my\ntruck, got all my stuff together, drove home approxi-\nmately, I guess, seven miles. Got home as I normally do.\nCame in through the garage. Of course, everybody was\nasleep. Took a shower, got into bed.\n\na\nAppendix E\nguess when I finally had fallen asleep, I just heard\n\na~a loud eannon-type bang that startled me and disori-\nented me. It startled me so\n\n(Page 90]\n\nbad to where I was lying flat, and I felt like T just sprung\n\"up out of the bed but was still laying flat. I don\u2019t know if,\nTlanded on my feet off - off the bed, or I landed baek on\nthe bed and then kind of got up.\n\nAnd I was ~ I just didn\u2019t know what was going on,\nwhat had happened, but I felt like it was some sort of\nhome invasion going on, [looked over at Trina, and she\nwas up, running around, and I was just kind of trying to\nget ourselves oriented on what was going on, Once I re-\nalized that ~ [felt that it was some sort of home invasion\n~- I keep my shotgun in the closet, which is behind the\nbathroom per se,\n\nSo I was on one side of the bedroom, and Trina was\nfn the opposite side, so we basically had to cross each\nother. Looks like she was running out of the room, and T\nwas running toward the closet to get my shotgun, so be-\nfore she could really cross me, I grabbed her, and I\npulled her in the room with me.\n\nAs I was running and pulling her toward the bath-\nroom area, I eould hear footsteps on ~ on the steps be-\ncause it's wood, and I assume they had on boots or what~\never, but I could hear it, And it sounded like people go-\ning downstairs and upstairs\n\n\nTa\nAppendix E\n(Page 91]\n\naround the same time. So I said to myself, that\u2019s a lat of,\npeople. And I was thinking about if I was going to have\nenough bullets to protect myself because I~ I'm think-\ning it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an actual gang of people who entered into\nthe house.\n\nAnd I kind of heard them coming down the hallway,\nsand they had entered into the bedroom, so I something\njust didn't seem right, but I wasn't sure, And so I would,\nhear them going like clear, clear, or something like that\nin referenee to that. And I wanted to buy some time, so\nwwe went into the closet, and I elosed the door because I\n\u2018was trying to figure out what was going on, Wait a see-\nond.\n\nGive me one second. I apologize.\n\nQ. Let me just \u2014let me just ~ where did you go right\n\nA, Lwent to the bathroom. I grabbed a tissue.\nQ Okay. Okay,\n\nA. So I heard people enter into the bathroom, and I\nhad this feeling of it\u2019s now or never, you got to make a\ndecision, you know? Are you going to shoot it up with\nthese people, or, you know, are you just going to just\ngive in and just let them do what they're going to do? So\nas [was thinking, I was\n\n8a\nAppendix E\n(Page 92]\n\nlike, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a home invasion, because I'm hear-\ning police ta k [sic)\n\nI mean, I'm reverting back to watehing T.V. and\nhearing this type of lingo when they go into people's\nhomes, you know, making sure that there's not a threat.\nsaying clear, clear. So something was telling me don't do\nanything with this shotgun. Don't do it. Its not going to\nend well, but I wasn't sure,\n\nSo they knocked on the door and was telling me to\ncome out, and I was like, who are ~ you know, what's\ngoing on? Who are you? And they was like, open the\ndoor, it\u2019s the police or something of that nature, but I~\n[still wasn't sure, I wasn't a hundred pereent sure what\nwas going on.\n\nBut my overall decision just said it's not going to end\nwell. If you shoot through this door, everybody is going\nto die, So I reluctantly released the door because I ~\nwas blocking them \u2014 them from opening it. They ~- they\nhave to press the door inwards to open it, and I was pre~\nventing that from happening.\n\nSo I opened the door, they snatch me out. Trina kind\nof fell because she was actually closer to the opening of\nthe door than I was because \u2014 s0\n\na\nAppendix E\n(Page 93]\n\nthey literally pulled me out. I believe she fell down in the\ncloset. Not to mention she didn't have on any clothes. So\nTwas embarrassed for her but yet fearful for my life at\nthe same time,\n\nThey pulled me out of the eloset, pulled me through\nthe bathroom, and then they threw me down on the floor\nin the master bedroom, And all ~all the time I'm asking\nthem, what's going on, this, that, and the third, and so\nwhen I'm laying on the ground, and I look up, I see all\nthese you know, appearing military dressed guys with\ntheir automatie weapons all pointed at me. So I immedi-\nately just ~ you know, I immediately just faced down,\n\nAnd they started bombarding me with all these\nquestions, and some of them I didn\u2019t hear, didn\u2019t know\nwhat they were referring to, And I was really confused.\nSo I~ remember him asking me what was my name ~\nlike my vital information, What was my name? What\nwas my address? Blah blah blah, And when ~ when T\ngave them my address, it just kind of got quiet. You\nknow, all the noise just ended,\n\nAnd 1 heard him tell one of the officers to go check\nthe address. And I hear him leaving out ofthe room or\nwhatever. And I guess about a minute\n\n(Page 94)\n\nor two, he came back in and whispered something to the\nlead officer and the lead officer, after that, he picked me\n\n80a\nAppendix E\n\nup, took the handeutis off of me, and he was just like, Pl\nbe right back,\n\nAnd him an his team started proceeding out of the\nhouse. And so I started following behind him, and T told\nTrina to check on il to make sure he's okay. And so\nI'm following them basically out of the house, trying to\nsee what's going on. Why did they do what they did?\nAnd they -- they all kind of -- he forcefully, you know,\ntold mo, hey, you know, Tl be right back, you know?\n\n\u2018No one would give me any explanation, And so I saw\nthem all meet in my front yard, and he gave them some\norders, and they started going, and they all jumped in\nthese unmarked cars, And I was sitting outside on the\nfront poreh, and I watched them go down the street on\nthe corner and basically do the same thing as far as en-\ntering into that house the way they ~ I assume they did\nat mine,\n\nAnd Isaid to myself.at that point, damn, I think they\nhit the wrong house. I think that was the house they\nwere supposed to get initially. They made a mistake.\nAnd so I watched them go in the house, round the people\nup inside the house, do what\n\n[Page 95]\n\nthey had to do, I went back inside to eek on \u2018hina\nHMMM rut mysete. Ard at some point, he did return back\nto the house, and he apologized, you know?\n\nHe gave me a card, said he had already contacted his\nsuperiors and to just give him a call, and they'll take care\n\nSia\nAppendix E\n\nof everything. And that was basieally it, I was just left\nthere to ~ with the door hanging off, with no type of se-\ncurity.\n\nAnd I basieally just stood there, you know, in front\nof the house all night until -- well, you know, until the\nsun came up. And that was basically the rundown of\nwhat happened to the best of my recollection\n\nQ. Okay. Thank you. P'l-you know, ask you more\nspecifie questions.\n\nHave you ever experienced a home invasion before?\n\nA. You mean as far as with the police or with ~ well,\nTl give you my answer, no, I haven't.\n\nQ. Just because you asked that did ~ have you expe-\nrieneed a home invasion without police?\n\nALNo.\n\nQ. Have you~ have you ever experienced a burglary\nin the home?\n\nA. With me in it?\n[Page 148]\n\nQ. Did he ever show you the warrants that were in-\nvolved in this ease?\n\nALNo.\n\na\nAppendix E\nQ Did he ever give you any understanding of why\nthey were going to 3741 Landau?\nALNo.\n\nQ.Did you ever eall the number on the business eard\nthat he gave you?\n\nAdi,\nQ. And who did you speak with?\n\nA. T'm not sure,\n\n. Do you recall what you spoke about on that eall?\n\nA. Yeah. We spoke about, I guess, like damages\npretty much. If I recall properly because I remember\nasking him before he left, are they going to repair the\ndoor? And he was like, no, we don't do that. So I do recall\nspeaking to the person on the number about that, seeing\nif they was going to send somebody out to repair or\nwhat's the process beeause that was my main concern at\nthat time,\n\nQ.The property damage?\n\nA. Security of a home. The door was not operational.\n\nQ. And when you ealled the number, was there\n(Page 149],\n\nany representation made about repairing the - the prop-\nerty that was damaged?\n\n8a\nAppendix E\nA. Lremember asking, and she told me that I would\nhave to take eare of that. And then probably, you know,\ncould maike an insurance claim and then some kind of\nway they would pay the insurance claim to the ~ to my\ninsurance company.\n\nQ You agree that there were a number of agents in-\nvolved in coming to your home; correet?\n\nALYes.\n\nQ. What do you contend specifically that Agent\nGuerra did wrong?\n\nMR. GREENAMYRE: Objection. Calls for a legal\nconclusion or attorney-client materials ~ attorney-client\nconversations that we've had.\n\nMR. ROSS: Are you instructing him not to answer?\n\nMR. GREENAMYRE: You ~ you ean answer to it.\nBut don't talk about anything that we have talked about,\n\u2018you~ you and me.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I have a simple answer.

Okay.\n\nIn your own words, can you tell me what you recall\nabout the incident?\n\nALYes.\nOn that particular night, I was sleeping. I heard\n\nbanging noises, and initially, I thought it was something\noutside, but the noises start to get closer. And then I\n\n88a\n\nAppendix F\nstarted to see bright lights and hearing a lot of bangs,\nand I realized that whatever it was, they were ~ it was\nin my \u2014 inside my house.\n\n(Page 52]\n\nI woke up Hilliard \u2014 Mr. Cliatt and told him that\nsomeone was breaking into our home. As I was running\ntowards the door to get my son, I~ Hilliard pulled me\ntowards the bathroom, which was located in our master\nbedroom. And then, from there, he pulled me into the\ncloset which was located in our bathroom ~ our master\nbathroom,\n\nI kept yelling, I need to go get my son ~ I kept yell-\ning, I need to go get my son. And when we were in the\ncloset, Hilliard -- Mr. Cliatt - we start to get the shotgun\nthat he had on the top shelf of the closet. I ~ I was in ~\nwas laying right underneath him asif was if was seek-\ning security or protection,\n\nAshe was reaching up to get the shotgun ~ as he was\nreaching up to get the shotgun, at the most hideous mo-\nment, the door opened, and there was aman. And at that\ntime, they were dressed in, like, SWAT outfits and uni-\nform and had masks on. So that's when they announced,\nfinally, that it was the FBI, but I didn\u2019t see anything on\ntheir clothing that said SWAT or FBI or anything that\nindicated that they were police.\n\nSo in my mind, I didn't ~ I didn\u2019t believe it because\nthey hadn't announced themselves\n\n8a\nAppendix F\n(Page 53]\n\nialy. And we were good-standing abiding citizens.\nAnd we didn\u2019t do anything for someone like the FBI to\ncome in our home. So at the time they ~ they pulled Mr.\nCliatt out the closet. And drag him out to the floor, hand\ncuffed him, When they did that, I fell in the comer of the\ncloset, halfdressed, only had on a little T-shirt, I didn\u2019t\nhave on any underwear or anything like that.\n\nTwas ~ the guy that was in the eloset with me was\npointing a gun at my face. And I just kept up like, just\ncalling for my son, asking if my son was okay, where is\nhe? And the guy that had his gun in my face just kept\ntelling me to worry about keeping my hands up. And T\ncould hear Mr. Cliatt being interrogated. They asked\nseveral questions, and when they were asking him the\nquestions, I - I \u2014 I remember looking over because\ncan see on my left-hand side that they were all eireled\naround him, and he was laying on the ground.\n\nAnd one of the last questions out of many that they\nasked him was, what's your address? And when he said\nthe address, I Saw one officer walk out the room. I don\u2019t.\nknow where he went. Shortly eame back and whispered\nin one of the other officer's ear, and then they announced\nthat they had the wrong\n\n(Page 54]\naddress, Allowed us to get up.\n\n\u2018The officer that was in the closet with me put his gun\ndown to let me get up. Yelled out, she doesn\u2019t have any\n\na\nAppendix F\n\nclothes on, let her through so she ean put some clothes\n\non, As I was walking in the room, everyone stormed out\n\nthe house, and when I came back out, I can see them go-\ning to the next block to the correct address.\n\nLater on, Mr. ~ Officer Guerra? Guerra? I'm not sure\nif I'm saying his name correctly. Came back. He person\nally apologized to my son, telling him that it wasn't his\nfault, and they apologize and don\u2019t think that he did an-\nything wrong. And he gave us a eard and went outside.\n\nQ. Do you recall what time you had gone to bed the\n~ the night of the incident?\n\nA.No. I don't recall the time I went to bed, no.\n\nQ. Do you recall what time you put GW to bed, or\nwhat time GW went to bed?\n\nA.

          "task_beliefs": "My knowledge has substantially evolved from a state of complete ignorance. The previous observation was purely procedural, but this new observation, containing the Appendix to the Petition with the full Eleventh Circuit opinion, provides the foundational legal and factual context of the case. I now have a detailed understanding of the events and the lower court's reasoning, which is crucial for predicting the Supreme Court's actions.\n\nMy beliefs are now structured around the following key points derived from the Eleventh Circuit's opinion:\n\n1.  **Factual Record:** I now know the specific, undisputed facts of the mistaken raid. Key details include: the FBI's \"Operation Red Tape\" targeting a violent gang member; Special Agent Guerra's preparatory steps (reviewing orders, attending briefings, conducting a daylight site survey); the critical failure of his personal GPS device in the pre-dawn hours leading to the wrong house; the striking physical similarities between the target and the Martin's home which contributed to the error; the tactical nature of the raid (no-knock, flashbang, full gear); and the agents' immediate withdrawal and apology upon realizing their mistake. These sympathetic facts for the Martin family make the case a compelling vehicle for the legal questions.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale:** I have learned the precise legal basis for the Eleventh Circuit's decision to affirm summary judgment for the government and its agents. This is the decision the Supreme Court is being asked to review.\n    *   **Qualified Immunity:** The agents were granted qualified immunity for the *Bivens* claim because their mistake was deemed \"reasonable.\" The court found that Agent Guerra's preparatory actions, despite their ultimate failure, constituted \"reasonable efforts to avoid error\" under the standard set by *Maryland v. Garrison*. The court emphasized the lack of a specific FBI policy mandating a particular navigation method, leaving it to the agent's discretion.\n    *   **Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Defenses:** The claims against the U.S. government were barred by two separate doctrines:\n        *   **Discretionary Function Exception:** This barred the negligence, trespass, and emotional distress claims. The court reasoned that the *planning* of a warrant execution, including how to locate the target, is a discretionary act susceptible to policy analysis, thus shielding the government from liability for errors made in the exercise of that discretion.\n        *   **Supremacy Clause:** This was the novel and critical basis for barring the intentional tort claims (assault, battery, false imprisonment). Relying on its own recent precedent in *Kordash v. United States*, the Eleventh Circuit held that if a federal officer's conduct is \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment (the same analysis used for qualified immunity), the Supremacy Clause bars state-law tort claims arising from that conduct.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS:** My understanding of the legal questions has sharpened considerably. The case presents a direct challenge to the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning, which creates a powerful, multi-layered shield against accountability.\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** The central issue is whether the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation effectively nullifies the FTCA's specific waiver of sovereign immunity for intentional torts committed by law enforcement (the \"law enforcement proviso\"). The petitioners will argue that using a Fourth Amendment \"reasonableness\" finding to trigger a Supremacy Clause defense creates a federal immunity that Congress did not intend, especially when the underlying state tort law (like Georgia's) does not offer a similar \"good faith\" or \"reasonableness\" defense to a private citizen. This creates a potential circuit split and a significant question of statutory interpretation.\n    *   **On the Discretionary Function Question:** The issue is the scope of \"discretion.\" The petitioners will likely argue that while high-level planning is discretionary, the on-the-ground execution\u2014specifically, the non-discretionary act of identifying the correct address on a warrant\u2014is not a \"policy judgment\" that the exception was meant to protect.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals:** The observation confirms that the petitioners are represented by the Institute for Justice, a prominent libertarian public interest firm known for high-quality advocacy on issues of individual rights versus government power. This signals a strong petition that will frame the case in a way that may appeal to a broad ideological spectrum of Justices concerned with government accountability and statutory limits on federal power. The combination of sympathetic facts and a clean, important legal question regarding the scope of the FTCA and federal immunity doctrines increases the likelihood of the Court granting certiorari.",

The sympathetic nature of these facts\u2014a pre-dawn, no-knock raid on the wrong house due to a GPS failure, causing significant distress to an innocent family\u2014continues to be a significant factor, making the case a compelling vehicle for the legal questions presented.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Stable):** My understanding of the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning remains the bedrock of my analysis. This is the decision under review, and its key holdings are:\n    *   **Qualified Immunity:** The agents' actions were deemed \"reasonable\" under *Maryland v.

This reasonableness finding shielded them from the *Bivens* claim.\n    *   **FTCA - Discretionary Function Exception:** This exception barred the state-law negligence and emotional distress claims, as the court found the *planning* of the raid to be a discretionary policy choice.\n    *   **FTCA - Supremacy Clause Immunity:** In a novel and critical move, the court used the Fourth Amendment \"reasonableness\" finding to invoke Supremacy Clause immunity, barring the state-law intentional tort claims (assault, battery).

My understanding of the core conflicts is therefore an inference based on the lower court's opinion, not yet a direct observation of the petitioners' strategy. The key conflicts remain:\n    *   **Supremacy Clause vs. FTCA's Law Enforcement Proviso:** Does the Eleventh Circuit's rule, which immunizes \"reasonable\" federal law enforcement conduct from state tort liability, effectively write the FTCA's waiver of immunity for intentional torts out of the statute? This remains the central question of statutory interpretation.\n    *   **Scope of the Discretionary Function Exception:** Is the act of physically identifying the correct address on a warrant a \"discretionary\" policy judgment, or is it a non-discretionary operational task that falls outside the exception's protection?\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Stable but Incomplete):**\n    *   The involvement of the Institute for Justice remains a strong positive signal for a high-quality, ideologically broad appeal.\n    *   The new observation highlights a critical missing piece of evidence: **the petition for a writ of certiorari itself.** While the appendix provided the lower court's reasoning, the petition is the key advocacy document. It will contain the petitioners' precise framing of the Questions Presented, their detailed arguments for why the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is wrong, and, crucially, any claims of a circuit split. The existence and nature of a circuit split is one of the most powerful predictors of a cert grant. My ability to predict the Court's action is currently limited by the absence of this document.

United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

The district \ncourt\u2019s opinion, granting the government reconsidera-\ntion and dismissing the case, Pet. App. 20a, is unre-\nported but available as Martin v. United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L.

See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a).

The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a reflection on my internal information-gathering strategy and does not introduce new substantive facts or legal arguments about the *Martin v. United States* case. As such, my previous task beliefs are preserved, and the critical information gap I previously identified is simply reinforced.\n\nMy current beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** My understanding of the facts surrounding the mistaken FBI raid on the Martin family's home is unchanged. The sympathetic nature of these facts remains a key contextual element.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Stable):** My knowledge of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, which is the decision under review, is unchanged. This includes its three key holdings:\n    *   **Qualified Immunity:** The agents' mistaken entry was deemed \"reasonable\" under *Maryland v. Garrison*, shielding them from the *Bivens* claim.\n    *   **FTCA - Discretionary Function Exception:** The planning of the raid was considered a discretionary policy choice, barring negligence claims.\n    *   **FTCA - Supremacy Clause Immunity:** The court applied its own precedent from *Kordash v. United States* to use the Fourth Amendment \"reasonableness\" finding as a basis for Supremacy Clause immunity, thereby barring the state-law intentional tort claims (assault, battery).\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Stable):** My inference of the central legal questions ripe for Supreme Court review remains the same:\n    *   **Supremacy Clause vs. FTCA's Law Enforcement Proviso:** The primary conflict is whether the Eleventh Circuit's rule, immunizing \"reasonable\" federal law enforcement conduct from state torts, improperly nullifies the FTCA's specific waiver of immunity for intentional torts committed by law enforcement.\n    *   **Scope of the Discretionary Function Exception:** The secondary conflict is whether the physical act of identifying the correct house for a raid is a protected \"discretionary\" policy judgment or a non-discretionary operational task.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Stable, with Reinforced Uncertainty):** The latest observation does not alter the known signals but sharpens my awareness of a critical deficiency.\n    *   The involvement of the Institute for Justice continues to signal a high-quality petition.\n    *   **Critical Missing Evidence (Unchanged, but Reinforced):** My previous belief state identified the **petition for a writ of certiorari** as the most important missing document. The new observation, which details my internal reasoning about failed search attempts, confirms that this document remains outside my knowledge base. This observation does not provide new information about the case; rather, it documents the persistence of this critical information gap. My analysis is still based on the issues as framed by the lower court, not as presented to the Supreme Court by the petitioners. My ability to predict the likelihood of a cert grant or the ultimate outcome remains significantly handicapped until I can analyze the petition's specific Questions Presented, legal arguments, and, most importantly, any evidence of a **circuit split**.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a monumental development, providing the Petitioners' Merits Brief. This document resolves the most critical information gap I had previously identified\u2014the content of the petition to the Court\u2014and confirms that the Supreme Court has already granted a writ of certiorari. This transforms the task from predicting a cert grant to predicting the final ruling on the merits. My beliefs are substantially updated and refined.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** My understanding of the facts of the mistaken FBI raid remains unchanged. The sympathetic nature of these facts continues to provide important context for the legal questions.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Stable but Refuted):** My knowledge of the Eleventh Circuit's holdings on qualified immunity, the discretionary function exception, and Supremacy Clause immunity is stable. However, I now possess the petitioners' direct and detailed legal arguments aimed at dismantling this rationale, moving my understanding from a simple summary of the lower court's opinion to an analysis of a direct legal confrontation.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Confirmed and Solidified):** My previous inference about the central legal conflicts is now confirmed and precisely framed by the **Questions Presented** in the petitioners' brief. The ambiguity is gone. The Court has agreed to decide:\n    *   **Question 1:** \"Whether the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause bars claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act when the negligent or wrongful acts of federal employees have some nexus with furthering federal policy and can reasonably be characterized as complying with the full range of federal law.\"\n    *   **Question 2:** \"Whether the discretionary-function exception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law enforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.\"\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Dramatically Strengthened and Altered):** The new observation provides the most powerful predictive signals to date.\n    *   **Certiorari Granted (New Major Signal):** The fact that the Court has taken the case (\"On Writ of Certiorari...\") is a definitive signal that at least four justices believe the Eleventh Circuit's decision is questionable and involves an important, unresolved question of federal law. This confirms the significance of the legal issues and the existence of a plausible path to reversal.\n    *   **Circuit Split Confirmed (New Evidence):** The petitioners' brief explicitly confirms and details the deep circuit split on the interplay between the discretionary-function exception (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)) and the law-enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). The brief notes that \"most circuit courts have concluded that the provisions conflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in favor of the exception.\" It cites cases from the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits, providing concrete evidence of the widespread disagreement that makes Supreme Court review necessary.\n    *   **Petitioners' Legal Arguments (New Detailed Knowledge):** I now have a complete understanding of the petitioners' legal strategy, which appears textually and structurally compelling:\n        *   **On the Supremacy Clause:** The petitioners argue that the Eleventh Circuit's holding creates a constitutional paradox. The Supremacy Clause makes federal law supreme, and the FTCA is a federal law that explicitly waives sovereign immunity. Therefore, the petitioners contend, the Supremacy Clause cannot be used to defeat a claim authorized by a federal statute. They frame the Eleventh Circuit's rule (from *Denson* and *Kordash*) as a judicial invention that contradicts the plain text and purpose of the FTCA.\n        *   **On the Discretionary Function Exception:** The petitioners present a two-pronged attack.\n            *   First, they argue the exception and the proviso are \"categorically distinct\" and do not overlap. The exception applies to policy-based decisions, while the proviso applies to specific intentional torts (assault, battery, etc.) which are operational, not policy-based, acts.\n            *   Second, they argue that even if a conflict were possible, the law-enforcement proviso\u2014as the more specific and later-enacted statute\u2014must prevail over the general discretionary-function exception, based on established canons of statutory interpretation (e.g., the specific governs the general). They argue that allowing the general exception to nullify the specific proviso would render Congress's 1974 amendment meaningless, an outcome courts should avoid.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Updated):** The previous critical gap\u2014the petition for certiorari\u2014has been filled and surpassed. The new, most important missing piece of evidence is the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief**. My ability to predict the final outcome is now contingent on understanding how the government will defend the Eleventh Circuit's novel Supremacy Clause theory and its position in the long-standing circuit split over the FTCA's exceptions. The government's arguments will be essential to gauge the Court's likely direction.",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a 'THINK' action, which reflects my internal reasoning and confirms my information-gathering strategy. It does not introduce new external facts or arguments about the case. Consequently, my substantive beliefs about the case parameters (\u03b8) remain stable, built upon the foundational information provided by the Petitioners' Merits Brief. My understanding is unchanged from the previous update, but I will restate it to reflect its stability and cumulative nature.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** My understanding of the underlying facts\u2014the mistaken no-knock raid by an FBI SWAT team on the Martin family's home\u2014is unchanged. These sympathetic facts for the petitioners continue to serve as the backdrop for the purely legal questions before the Court.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Stable):** The Eleventh Circuit's reasoning for granting summary judgment to the government remains a fixed point of analysis. It rests on three pillars: qualified immunity for the agents, a novel Supremacy Clause immunity theory barring the FTCA claim, and the application of the discretionary function exception to negate the FTCA's law enforcement proviso. The petitioners' brief is aimed squarely at dismantling the latter two.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Confirmed and Unchanged):** The ambiguity about the case's scope is entirely resolved. The Supreme Court's review is precisely focused on the two questions presented in the petitioners' brief, which I now know by heart:\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):** \"Whether the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause bars claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act when the negligent or wrongful acts of federal employees have some nexus with furthering federal policy and can reasonably be characterized as complying with the full range of federal law.\"\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions):** \"Whether the discretionary-function exception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law enforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.\"\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Stable):** My knowledge of the arguments and signals pointing toward a potential outcome is solid but one-sided, reflecting the information received so far.\n    *   **Certiorari Grant (Stable Major Signal):** The Court's decision to take the case remains the strongest signal that the Eleventh Circuit's decision is in serious jeopardy. It confirms that at least four justices see a significant, review-worthy legal issue, likely the deep circuit split and/or the novelty of the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding.\n    *   **Confirmed Circuit Split (Stable Evidence):** The petitioners' brief has provided concrete evidence of a long-standing and deep circuit split on Question 2. The brief documents that most circuits find the discretionary-function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law-enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) to be in conflict, with nearly all of those resolving it by allowing the general exception to swallow the specific proviso. This split is a classic reason for the Supreme Court to intervene and create a uniform national rule.\n    *   **Petitioners' Legal Arguments (Stable Detailed Knowledge):** My understanding of the petitioners' case is comprehensive.\n        *   **Supremacy Clause Argument:** They argue the Eleventh Circuit created a legal absurdity by using the Supremacy Clause (which makes federal law supreme) to defeat a claim explicitly authorized by a federal law (the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity).\n        *   **FTCA Argument:** They deploy a powerful statutory interpretation argument. They contend that the discretionary-function exception and the law-enforcement proviso are distinct and do not overlap. Alternatively, if they do conflict, standard canons of interpretation (specific over general, avoiding interpretations that render a provision meaningless) dictate that the more specific and later-enacted law-enforcement proviso must prevail. This argument appears textually and structurally strong.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Unchanged):** The 'THINK' observation explicitly confirmed my assessment of the most critical information gap. My current belief state is heavily skewed by having only the petitioners' side of the story. To make a credible prediction of the Court's final ruling, I must acquire and analyze the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief**. This document is essential to understand how the government will:\n    *   Defend the Eleventh Circuit's controversial Supremacy Clause theory.\n    *   Justify its position in the circuit split, arguing why the general discretionary-function exception should override the specific law-enforcement proviso.\n    *   Frame the policy implications of a ruling in favor of the petitioners.",

My understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) has shifted significantly. \n\n1.  **On Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):** The government is not merely defending the Eleventh Circuit's novel theory. Instead, they are advancing a more nuanced argument: if a federal officer's actions are deemed 'reasonable' under the Fourth Amendment (as they were for qualified immunity), then state tort law cannot impose liability on the U.S. government for those actions. This reframes the conflict from state law vs. a federal statute (FTCA) to state law vs. federal constitutional compliance. This is a more plausible argument for the Court to consider, even if it ultimately rejects it.\n\n2.  **On Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions):** The government's primary strategy is to re-characterize the tort to avoid a direct clash between the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). They argue the claim arises not from the assault/battery itself, but from the 'antecedent negligence' in planning the raid (site survey, navigation). They contend this planning is a classic discretionary function under the *Gaubert* test, involving policy judgments about resource allocation, secrecy, and safety. This provides a path for the Court to affirm the dismissal on narrow grounds without resolving the broader circuit split.\n\nMy belief state is now much more balanced.

Its value is not in acquiring new external data, but in processing the recently acquired 'Brief in Opposition' to fundamentally reshape the agent's predictive model.\n\nTask EIG is high (0.8) because the thought process moves beyond a simple summary of the government's brief. It correctly identifies and analyzes the government's sophisticated 'off-ramp' arguments: the 'antecedent negligence' theory for the FTCA claim and the refined Supremacy Clause argument linked to Fourth Amendment reasonableness. This transforms the prediction from a likely reversal of the Eleventh Circuit into a complex scenario where the Court could affirm the judgment on narrower, alternative grounds. This dramatically reduces uncertainty about the *possible legal pathways* to a final judgment, which is a core component of the task.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action provides a textbook example of a crucial, generalizable strategy in legal prediction. It demonstrates how to (1) process a major opposing brief, (2) identify when a party is attempting to reframe the core legal question, (3) update the significance of a circuit split based on case-specific arguments, and (4) re-prioritize future information gathering (Merits Brief, Amicus Briefs) based on the newly revealed legal landscape. This is a key learning moment for the overall BOED design.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this internal synthesis is the essential bridge between raw observation and intelligent, targeted future action.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the U.S. government's \"Brief for the Respondents in Opposition\" (BIO), filed by the Solicitor General to argue against the Supreme Court taking this case. While this is not the final Merits Brief, it is a highly reliable and information-dense preview of the government's core legal strategy. This observation fundamentally alters my belief state from a one-sided understanding based on the petitioners' arguments to a more balanced, two-sided view of the legal conflict.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The underlying facts of the mistaken FBI raid on the Martin family's home remain undisputed and are confirmed in the government's own telling of the events in the BIO.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Contextualized):** My understanding of the Eleventh Circuit's decision is now contextualized by the government's defense of it. The BIO shows the government will not necessarily defend the Eleventh Circuit's novel Supremacy Clause theory as the *only* way to rule for them. Instead, they frame it as one of several paths to the \"correct\" result, which is the dismissal of the petitioners' claims.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Dramatically Sharpened):** The BIO provides the first direct counterarguments to the petitioners, transforming my understanding from a simple summary of the petitioners' case to a nuanced view of the legal battlefield.\n\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):**\n        *   **Previous Belief:** This was a novel, likely erroneous theory from the Eleventh Circuit that the Supreme Court would probably strike down.\n        *   **New Information (Government's Argument):** The government defends the Supremacy Clause holding by linking it to the agents' compliance with federal constitutional law. Their argument, as previewed in the BIO, is that if a federal officer's actions are deemed \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment (as they were here on the qualified immunity claim) and are in furtherance of a federal policy (executing a warrant), then state tort law cannot be used to impose liability on the U.S. government for those actions. This frames the issue not as state law vs. federal statute (FTCA), but as state tort law impeding the execution of federal duties that are already compliant with the supreme federal law of the Constitution.\n        *   **Updated Belief:** The government's argument is more sophisticated than a simple misreading of the Supremacy Clause. They are advancing a theory of implied immunity rooted in federalism principles, arguing that the FTCA's waiver of immunity shouldn't apply when federal agents are acting in a constitutionally permissible manner. This significantly complicates the analysis and provides a potential, albeit controversial, basis for the Court to affirm.\n\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions: Discretionary Function vs. Law Enforcement Proviso):**\n        *   **Previous Belief:** The petitioners had a strong textualist argument (\"specific over general\") that the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) must prevail over the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)), and the deep circuit split made this a prime issue for reversal.\n        *   **New Information (Government's Argument):** The government's strategy, revealed in the BIO, is to sidestep a direct conflict between the two clauses by re-characterizing the tort. They argue:\n            1.  **The \"Antecedent Negligence\" Theory:** The *actual* wrongful act was not the assault or battery itself, but the *negligent preparation* that led to it. This includes the site survey, navigation, and identification of the house.\n            2.  **Planning is a Discretionary Function:** This preparatory conduct, they argue, falls squarely within the discretionary function exception under the *United States v. Gaubert* test. FBI policy gives agents discretion on *how* to locate a target, and these decisions involve balancing policy factors like secrecy, urgency, and agent safety.\n            3.  **Downplaying the Split:** The government contends that even in circuits that hold the proviso \"trumps\" the exception, the petitioners would *still lose*. This is because, in the government's view, those courts would agree that claims based on antecedent planning negligence are barred by the discretionary function exception, which is analyzed separately from the intentional torts that result.\n        *   **Updated Belief:** The legal question is not as simple as \"which clause wins?\" The government has introduced a critical distinction between the *planning* of the operation and the *execution* of the intentional tort. My prediction must now account for the possibility that the Court could rule that the discretionary function exception bars the claim because the \"claim arises out of\" the negligent planning, not the assault itself. This provides a path for the Court to affirm the dismissal without necessarily adopting the Eleventh Circuit's controversial reasoning on the proviso or the Supremacy Clause.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Updated and Balanced):**\n    *   **Certiorari Grant (Stable Signal, Re-contextualized):** The grant remains a strong signal that the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is in jeopardy. However, the government's arguments in the BIO suggest a possible outcome: the Court could reverse the Eleventh Circuit's specific legal theories but still affirm the judgment on the alternative ground that the claim is barred by the discretionary function exception due to \"antecedent negligence.\"\n    *   **Circuit Split (Stable, but Nuanced):** The split is undeniable. However, the government's argument attempts to render it irrelevant to the outcome of *this specific case*. The key question now is whether the Supreme Court will see this case as a vehicle to resolve the split cleanly or whether they will accept the government's invitation to decide the case on narrower, fact-specific grounds related to planning.\n    *   **Petitioners' Arguments (Now Counterbalanced):** The petitioners' clean, text-based arguments are now met with the government's more granular, fact-based defense that attempts to sever the planning stage (discretionary) from the execution stage (tortious).\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Refined):** The most critical missing evidence remains the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief**. The BIO was an argument *against* hearing the case and may not represent the final, fully developed version of their arguments. The merits brief will provide the definitive statement of their position and may refine or abandon arguments presented in the BIO. However, the BIO has successfully filled the void regarding the government's fundamental strategy.",

Public Citizen has a longstanding interest in \npreserving state-law remedies for personal injury \nagainst unwarranted claims of preemption by federal \nlaw under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, and \nhas frequently filed briefs in this Court and others ad-\ndressing Supremacy Clause issues. Public Citizen \nsubmits this brief to address the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Supremacy Clause preempts federal-\nlaw remedies by prohibiting the application of tort \nprinciples derived from state law, which Congress ex-\nplicitly incorporated into federal law when it imposed \ntort liability on the United States under the Federal \nTort Claims Act. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) creates a fed-\neral right of action against the United States for torts \ncommitted by federal employees and waives sovereign \nimmunity for claims that fall within the scope of that \nright of action. The FTCA provides that, with some ex-\nceptions, the United States shall be liable for torts to \nthe same extent as a private person under similar cir-\ncumstances. It does so by adopting as its standard for \nliability the principles of state tort law that would be \napplicable to a private person in the state where the \nallegedly tortious conduct occurred.  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n1 This brief was not authored in whole or part by counsel for \na party. No one other than amicus curiae made a monetary con-\ntribution to preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \n \nUnder the FTCA, those state-law principles do not \napply to claims against the United States by their own \nforce, but because Congress enacted a statute mandat-\ning their application. To ensure that its chosen stand-\nard of liability would not adversely affect legitimate \ngovernment interests, Congress also enacted a baker\u2019s \ndozen of exceptions excusing the United States from \nliability for injuries even if the conduct causing them \nwould be tortious under state law if committed by a \nprivate person. \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit held that the \nConstitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause bars enforcement of \nthe FTCA\u2019s requirement that the tort liability of the \nUnited States be based on principles borrowed from \nstate tort law. According to the court of appeals, the \nSupremacy Clause prohibits imposition of tort liabil-\nity on the United States under the FTCA if the tor-\ntious acts \u201chave some nexus with furthering federal \npolicy and can reasonably be characterized as comply-\ning with the full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 11a \n(quoting Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, \n1293 (11th Cir. 2022), and Denson v. United States, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1344 (11th Cir. 2009)). \nThat holding turns the Supremacy Clause upside-\ndown. The Supremacy Clause, as this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions have explained, is fundamentally a choice-of-law \nprovision, requiring courts to apply requirements of \nthe Constitution and federal laws enacted in accord-\nance with its provisions, notwithstanding purported \ncommands of state law to the contrary. Here, a federal \nlaw\u2014the FTCA\u2014dictates that the United States be \nheld liable in circumstances where a private person \nwould be liable under state tort law. The Supremacy \nClause therefore requires that the FTCA be treated as \nthe supreme law of the land and binds judges to apply \n\n \n3 \n \nthe standard of liability the FTCA specifies. Moreover, \nthe Supremacy Clause by its terms preempts a state \nlaw only to the extent that the state law provides \nsomething \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal law. But when federal \nlaw explicitly borrows state-law principles to supply \nthe federal rule of decision for courts to apply, the ap-\nplication of those principles is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal \nlaw. \nThe court of appeals, however, held that courts \ncannot apply a federal statutory command that, in the \ncourt\u2019s view, is contrary to the purposes and objectives \nof federal law more generally. See Pet. App. 16a. At \nbest, the court has identified an implied conflict be-\ntween the FTCA\u2019s requirements and other supposed \nprinciples of federal law. But the Supremacy Clause \nhas nothing to do with claimed conflicts among federal \nlaws. Resolving tensions within the body of federal \nlaw is, as this Court has pointed out, an ordinary mat-\nter of federal statutory construction not governed by \nSupremacy Clause preemption principles. Thus, the \nanswer to the first question presented by this case\u2014\nwhether the Supremacy Clause bars FTCA claims in \nthe circumstances described by the court of appeals\u2014\nis unequivocally no. The determinative issue in the \ncase is therefore whether the claims at issue fall \nwithin an exception to the FTCA. \nARGUMENT \nI. Liability under the FTCA is imposed by \nfederal statute, not state law. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s erroneous invocation of the \nSupremacy Clause to restrict the application of fed-\neral statutory requirements rests on the mistaken \npremise that FTCA actions against the United States \nare \u201csuits under state law against federal officials \n\n \n4 \n \ncarrying out their executive duties\u201d and, therefore, \nmust be policed under the implied conflict preemption \ndoctrine to ensure that the \u201cstate-law liability\u201d they \nmay impose does not \u201cstand[ ] as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress.\u201d Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th at 1293 \n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). \nThat understanding of the FTCA is flatly wrong.  \nAn FTCA action is a suit under federal law that \nimposes federal-law liability through the application \nof rules of decision dictated by statutory provisions en-\nacted by Congress. The FTCA does not waive the sov-\nereign immunity of the United States against tort \ncauses of action that exist independently of federal \nlaw. Rather, the FTCA itself imposes the liabilities \nthat are subject to its waiver of sovereign immunity \nby providing that \u201c[t]he United States shall be liable\u201d \nin tort for actions of its officers, employees, and agen-\ncies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. The FTCA also creates a federal \ncause of action and grants the federal courts exclusive \njurisdiction to adjudicate actions asserting that cause \nof action. See id. \u00a7 1346(b). The statute specifies the \nprerequisites for bringing FTCA actions and the time \nin which they must be brought, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2675 & 2401; \nidentifies the basic legal principles that govern such \nclaims, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) & 2674; enumerates \u201cexcep-\ntions\u201d to liability that function as defenses, see id. \n\u00a7 2680; limits the remedies and attorney fees availa-\nble when liability is found, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 & 2678; \nspecifies the effect of a judgment in an FTCA action, \nsee id. \u00a7 2676; and provides that the FTCA is the ex-\nclusive remedy for injuries resulting from governmen-\ntal acts or omissions within its scope, see id. \u00a7 2679(b). \nIn short, the United States is liable under the FTCA \n\n \n5 \n \nonly when and to the extent that Congress has im-\nposed liability by statute. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the FTCA none-\ntheless involves \u201csuits under state law\u201d and \u201cstate-law \nliability\u201d reflects a misunderstanding of Congress\u2019s \ndecision to borrow state-law tort principles to define \nthe tort liability that the FTCA imposes. Specifically, \nthe FTCA provides that the United States is liable in \ntort \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a \nprivate individual under like circumstances,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2674\u2014that is, it is liable \u201cunder circum-\nstances where the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the \nlaw of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 1346(b); see also id. \u00a7 2672 (using same language \nto describe authority of federal agencies to settle tort \nclaims). \nThat language, however, does not suggest that \nstate law applies of its own force to the federal govern-\nment in FTCA actions or that the resulting liability is \nliability under state law. To the contrary, state tort \nprinciples apply only because, and to the extent that, \nCongress has chosen to use them as the standard for \nthe liability that the FTCA creates. Indeed, the state-\nlaw principles that Congress incorporated to deter-\nmine the liability of the United States under the \nFTCA do so wholly without regard to whether they are \napplicable to the United States or any other govern-\nmental body under state law. For example, this Court \nlong ago held that state tort defenses and other limi-\ntations on liability applicable to government defend-\nants are not incorporated in the FTCA. See United \nStates v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 164\u201365 (1963); Indian \nTowing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 65 (1955). \nThus, the FTCA does not provide that the United \n\n \n6 \n \nStates is liable when state law says it (or government \nentities more generally) is liable, but instead that it is \nliable under circumstances similar to those in which \nstate law would say that someone else (a private per-\nson) would be liable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The imposi-\ntion of liability on the United States in such circum-\nstances does not find its source in state law, but is en-\ntirely the creation of a federal statute. \nMoreover, Congress adopted special defenses not \notherwise available under state law to ensure that its \nchoice of using state tort principles applicable to pri-\nvate actors does not impinge on federal governmental \ninterests. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680; Muniz, 374 U.S. at 163 \n(\u201cCongress has taken steps to protect the Government \nfrom liability that would seriously handicap efficient \ngovernment operations.\u201d). Those defenses, where ap-\nplicable, exclude liability for such things as the exer-\ncise of discretionary governmental functions, id. \n\u00a7 2680(a), \nnegligent \ntransmission \nof \nmail, \nid. \n\u00a7 2680(b), imposition of quarantines, id. \u00a7 2680(f); \ncommission of certain intentional torts, id. \u00a7 2680(h); \nregulation of the monetary system, id. \u00a7 2680(i), and \ncombat operations of the armed forces, id. \u00a7 2680(j). \nThe statute also incorporates certain federal govern-\nmental immunities, id. \u00a7 2674 (third paragraph), and \nexcludes constitutional torts and certain federal stat-\nutory claims, id. \u00a7 2679(b)(2). The result of this retic-\nulated federal statutory scheme is a form of liability \nthat no state purports to or could impose on the United \nStates: namely, liability in circumstances analogous \nto those under which state law would recognize pri-\nvate tort liability, but subject to defenses and other \nprocedural and substantive limitations designed by \nCongress to balance federal government interests \n\n \n7 \n \nagainst the interest in providing recovery to persons \ninjured by negligent or wrongful government actions. \nAlthough this Court has occasionally referred in \nshorthand to FTCA actions against the United States \nas involving \u201cstate-law tort suits against the Federal \nGovernment,\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, 210 \n(2021), its decisions have consistently recognized that \nthe liability of the United States in such actions is \ngrounded on federal law, in the form of a statute en-\nacted by Congress. For example, in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 \nU.S. 471 (1994), the Court observed that, through the \nFTCA\u2014and specifically through the language codified \nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)\u2014\u201cthe United States has \u2026 \u2018ren-\nder[ed]\u2019 itself liable\u201d for torts in circumstances in \nwhich state law would hold a private person liable. Id. \nat 477 (emphasis added; quoting Richards v. United \nStates, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962)). The Court has explicitly \nrecognized that \u201cwhether a private person would be \nresponsible for similar negligence under the laws of \nthe State where the acts occurred\u201d is \u201cthe test estab-\nlished by the Tort Claims Act for determining the \nUnited States\u2019 liability.\u201d Rayonier Inc. v. United \nStates, 352 U.S. 315, 319 (1957). The standard of lia-\nbility \u201cis controlled by a formal expression of the will \nof Congress,\u201d Richards, 369 U.S. at 7, which deter-\nmines the scope of the \u201cremedies provided by Con-\ngress,\u201d Muniz, 374 U.S. at 165\u201366. Thus, whether a \nprivate person would be liable for similar conduct un-\nder state tort law is one of the \u201celements\u201d of the federal \ncause of action created by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Brown-\nback, 592 U.S. at 212; see also id. at 216 (\u201c[O]ne ele-\nment of an FTCA claim is that the plaintiff establish \nthat the Government employee would be liable under \nstate law.\u201d).  \n\n \n8 \n \nThis Court\u2019s consistent readings of the FTCA con-\nfirm what is plain from the statutory language. State \nlaw itself does not impose liability under the FTCA. \nState-law principles that would apply to the liability \nof private persons are used as part of the determina-\ntion of the liability of the United States only because \na federal law duly enacted by Congress so requires. \nII. The Supremacy Clause does not limit, but \nrather requires, application of federal law. \nThe Supremacy Clause dictates that federal laws \nenacted pursuant to the Constitution are the law of \nthe land, and it resolves conflicts between the com-\nmands of federal laws and contrary state laws. The \nClause thus compels adherence to the FTCA\u2019s di-\nrective that state-law principles that would apply to \nprivate tortfeasors form the basis of the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s tort liability. The application of those prin-\nciples cannot be contrary to federal law when federal \nlaw expressly requires their application. \nThe Supremacy Clause provides that \u201c[t]his Con-\nstitution, and the Laws of the United States which \nshall be made in Pursuance thereof \u2026 shall be the su-\npreme Law of the Land; \u2026 any Thing in the Constitu-\ntion or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwith-\nstanding.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. The Supremacy \nClause requires \u201cpreemption\u201d of state laws where giv-\ning them effect would be in derogation of the suprem-\nacy of the Constitution or a valid federal law enacted \nunder it\u2014that is, where state law stands in contradic-\ntion to some applicable command of federal law. See \nMurphy v. NCAA, 584 U.S. 453, 477 (2018). All forms \nof preemption, in other words, involve \u201ca clash be-\ntween a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s legisla-\ntive power and conflicting state law.\u201d Murphy, 584 \n\n \n9 \n \nU.S. at 479. Where such a clash occurs, the Supremacy \nClause provides a \u201crule of decision\u201d: Courts must give \neffect to the federal law, not the conflicting state one. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 324 (2015).  \nMore broadly, the Constitution\u2019s creation of a sov-\nereign federal union under a government that, \u201cwithin \nits own sphere,\u201d is \u201csupreme\u201d necessarily \u201cexempt[s] \n[that government\u2019s] operations from [the] influence\u201d of \n\u201cpower vested in subordinate governments.\u201d McCul-\nloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 427 (1819). That is, \u201cthe \nactivities of the Federal Government are free from \nregulation by any state,\u201d Mayo v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 441, 445 (1943), because a \u201csubordinate sover-\neign\u201d cannot control the government of the United \nStates without its consent, Hancock v. Train, 426 U.S. \n167, 179 (1976). As this Court recently explained, \n\u201c[t]he Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause generally im-\nmunizes the Federal Government from state laws that \ndirectly regulate or discriminate against it.\u201d United \nStates v. Washington, 596 U.S. 832, 835 (2022). \nBecause preemption under the Supremacy Clause \nis always triggered by a clash between federal and \nstate law, however, the Supremacy Clause allows even \ndirect application of state regulations to the federal \ngovernment if authorized by a federal statute. In that \ncircumstance, state regulation is in conformity with, \nnot contrary to, the laws of the United States. See \nUnited States v. Washington, 596 U.S. at 839\u201340. \nLikewise, not all differences between state law and \nfederal law, or all impacts of state laws on federal gov-\nernment interests, give rise to preemption, because \nnot all involve contradictory or conflicting federal and \nstate commands. See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda Motor \nof Am., Inc., 562 U.S. 323 (2011); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 \n\n \n10 \n \nU.S. 555 (2009); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 \nU.S. 51 (2002). And where a federal law authorizes or \ncontemplates the operation of state law, the federal \nlaw does not displace state law because giving it effect, \nas the Supremacy Clause demands, requires that \nstate law not be disturbed. Put another way, state \nlaws are not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal laws that require or \npermit the state laws\u2019 operation.  \nThus, as this Court has said time and again,  \u201c[t]he \npurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u201d in de-\ntermining the preemptive effects of federal law. Retail \nClerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96, 103 \n(1963); see Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 578 \nU.S. 150, 162\u201363 (2016); Wyeth, 562 U.S. at 565. This \nproposition holds good in \u201cevery pre-emption case,\u201d \nHughes, 578 U.S. at 163, \u201c[w]hatever the category of \npreemption asserted\u201d\u2014be it express, implied, or field \npreemption. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. \n761, 785 (2019) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judg-\nment). \nIt follows that, in the first instance, \u201c \u2018[e]vidence of \npre-emptive purpose,\u2019 whether express or implied, \nmust \u2026 be \u2018sought in the text and structure of the stat-\nute at issue.\u2019 \u201d Va. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead \nopinion of Gorsuch, J.) (quoting CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nEasterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664 (1993)). Thus, a litigant \nclaiming preemption based on conflict between state \nlaw and the requirements, purposes, or objectives of \nfederal law \u201cmust point specifically to \u2018a constitutional \ntext or a federal statute\u2019 that does the displacing or \nconflicts with state law.\u201d Id. at 767 (citation omitted). \nCourts considering such claims, moreover, must re-\nspect both \u201cwhat Congress wrote\u201d and \u201cwhat it didn\u2019t \nwrite.\u201d Id. at 765. The inquiry turns on \u201cwhat can be \n\n \n11 \n \nfound in the law itself,\u201d id. at 779, not on \u201cabstract and \nunenacted legislative desires,\u201d id. at 778. \nIn light of these principles, courts must give effect \nto federal statutory provisions whose terms manifest \nan intent to allow application of state laws even when \nthose laws might otherwise be impliedly preempted \nbecause of a conflict of some kind with federal law. \nSee, e.g., Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 575; Silkwood v. Kerr-\nMcGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 256 (1984). Disregard of \nsuch statutory provisions would violate the cardinal \nrule that preemption of whatever stripe\u2014express \npreemption, implied field preemption, or implied con-\nflict preemption\u2014is always a matter of congressional \nintent discernible from statutory text and structure. \nVa. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead opinion of Gor-\nsuch, J.); id. at 785 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the \njudgment). When a federal statute allows or requires \nstate law to operate, effectuating the law enacted by \nCongress requires giving effect to its command that \nstate laws remain operative. If a federal statute does \nnot in some way require displacement of state law, \nsuch displacement cannot be necessary to ensure the \nfederal statute\u2019s \u201csupremacy.\u201d \nThus, the Court has repeatedly held that federal \nstatutes may limit or foreclose the otherwise preemp-\ntive effects of federal law. See, e.g., Calif. Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ass\u2019n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272 (1987); Malone v. \nWhite Motor Corp., 435 U.S. 497 (1978); Schermer-\nhorn, 375 U.S. 96. Such \u201cantipre-emption provisions,\u201d \nas Justice Scalia labeled them, Guerra, 479 U.S. at \n295 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), are, like \nother federal statutory commands, the law of the land \nand must be given effect under the Supremacy Clause.  \n\n \n12 \n \nIndeed, the Supremacy Clause effectively allows \nCongress to reverse the ordinary rule that federal law \npreempts conflicting state law and to provide that \nstate laws prevail in cases of conflict. For example, the \nCourt has held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \nwhich provides that no federal statute \u201cshall be con-\nstrued to invalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d state laws \nregulating the business of insurance, 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1012(b), functions as a reverse-preemption provi-\nsion: Where \u201cthere is a direct conflict between [a] fed-\neral \u2026 statute and [state] law,\u201d the \u201cterms of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act\u201d provide that \u201cfederal law \nmust yield.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, \n502 (1993). Because the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a \nlaw of the United States enacted pursuant to the Con-\nsti\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Public Citizen has a longstanding interest in \npreserving state-law remedies for personal injury \nagainst unwarranted claims of preemption by federal \nlaw under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, and \nhas frequently filed briefs in this Court and others ad-\ndressing Supremacy Clause issues. Public Citizen \nsubmits this brief to address the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Supremacy Clause preempts federal-\nlaw remedies by prohibiting the application of tort \nprinciples derived from state law, which Congress ex-\nplicitly incorporated into federal law when it imposed \ntort liability on the United States under the Federal \nTort Claims Act. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) creates a fed-\neral right of action against the United States for torts \ncommitted by federal employees and waives sovereign \nimmunity for claims that fall within the scope of that \nright of action. The FTCA provides that, with some ex-\nceptions, the United States shall be liable for torts to \nthe same extent as a private person under similar cir-\ncumstances. It does so by adopting as its standard for \nliability the principles of state tort law that would be \napplicable to a private person in the state where the \nallegedly tortious conduct occurred.  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n1 This brief was not authored in whole or part by counsel for \na party. No one other than amicus curiae made a monetary con-\ntribution to preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \n \nUnder the FTCA, those state-law principles do not \napply to claims against the United States by their own \nforce, but because Congress enacted a statute mandat-\ning their application. To ensure that its chosen stand-\nard of liability would not adversely affect legitimate \ngovernment interests, Congress also enacted a baker\u2019s \ndozen of exceptions excusing the United States from \nliability for injuries even if the conduct causing them \nwould be tortious under state law if committed by a \nprivate person. \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit held that the \nConstitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause bars enforcement of \nthe FTCA\u2019s requirement that the tort liability of the \nUnited States be based on principles borrowed from \nstate tort law. According to the court of appeals, the \nSupremacy Clause prohibits imposition of tort liabil-\nity on the United States under the FTCA if the tor-\ntious acts \u201chave some nexus with furthering federal \npolicy and can reasonably be characterized as comply-\ning with the full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 11a \n(quoting Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, \n1293 (11th Cir. 2022), and Denson v. United States, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1344 (11th Cir. 2009)). \nThat holding turns the Supremacy Clause upside-\ndown. The Supremacy Clause, as this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions have explained, is fundamentally a choice-of-law \nprovision, requiring courts to apply requirements of \nthe Constitution and federal laws enacted in accord-\nance with its provisions, notwithstanding purported \ncommands of state law to the contrary. Here, a federal \nlaw\u2014the FTCA\u2014dictates that the United States be \nheld liable in circumstances where a private person \nwould be liable under state tort law. The Supremacy \nClause therefore requires that the FTCA be treated as \nthe supreme law of the land and binds judges to apply \n\n \n3 \n \nthe standard of liability the FTCA specifies. Moreover, \nthe Supremacy Clause by its terms preempts a state \nlaw only to the extent that the state law provides \nsomething \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal law. But when federal \nlaw explicitly borrows state-law principles to supply \nthe federal rule of decision for courts to apply, the ap-\nplication of those principles is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal \nlaw. \nThe court of appeals, however, held that courts \ncannot apply a federal statutory command that, in the \ncourt\u2019s view, is contrary to the purposes and objectives \nof federal law more generally. See Pet. App. 16a. At \nbest, the court has identified an implied conflict be-\ntween the FTCA\u2019s requirements and other supposed \nprinciples of federal law. But the Supremacy Clause \nhas nothing to do with claimed conflicts among federal \nlaws. Resolving tensions within the body of federal \nlaw is, as this Court has pointed out, an ordinary mat-\nter of federal statutory construction not governed by \nSupremacy Clause preemption principles. Thus, the \nanswer to the first question presented by this case\u2014\nwhether the Supremacy Clause bars FTCA claims in \nthe circumstances described by the court of appeals\u2014\nis unequivocally no. The determinative issue in the \ncase is therefore whether the claims at issue fall \nwithin an exception to the FTCA. \nARGUMENT \nI. Liability under the FTCA is imposed by \nfederal statute, not state law. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s erroneous invocation of the \nSupremacy Clause to restrict the application of fed-\neral statutory requirements rests on the mistaken \npremise that FTCA actions against the United States \nare \u201csuits under state law against federal officials \n\n \n4 \n \ncarrying out their executive duties\u201d and, therefore, \nmust be policed under the implied conflict preemption \ndoctrine to ensure that the \u201cstate-law liability\u201d they \nmay impose does not \u201cstand[ ] as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress.\u201d Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th at 1293 \n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). \nThat understanding of the FTCA is flatly wrong.  \nAn FTCA action is a suit under federal law that \nimposes federal-law liability through the application \nof rules of decision dictated by statutory provisions en-\nacted by Congress. The FTCA does not waive the sov-\nereign immunity of the United States against tort \ncauses of action that exist independently of federal \nlaw. Rather, the FTCA itself imposes the liabilities \nthat are subject to its waiver of sovereign immunity \nby providing that \u201c[t]he United States shall be liable\u201d \nin tort for actions of its officers, employees, and agen-\ncies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. The FTCA also creates a federal \ncause of action and grants the federal courts exclusive \njurisdiction to adjudicate actions asserting that cause \nof action. See id. \u00a7 1346(b). The statute specifies the \nprerequisites for bringing FTCA actions and the time \nin which they must be brought, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2675 & 2401; \nidentifies the basic legal principles that govern such \nclaims, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) & 2674; enumerates \u201cexcep-\ntions\u201d to liability that function as defenses, see id. \n\u00a7 2680; limits the remedies and attorney fees availa-\nble when liability is found, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 & 2678; \nspecifies the effect of a judgment in an FTCA action, \nsee id. \u00a7 2676; and provides that the FTCA is the ex-\nclusive remedy for injuries resulting from governmen-\ntal acts or omissions within its scope, see id. \u00a7 2679(b). \nIn short, the United States is liable under the FTCA \n\n \n5 \n \nonly when and to the extent that Congress has im-\nposed liability by statute. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the FTCA none-\ntheless involves \u201csuits under state law\u201d and \u201cstate-law \nliability\u201d reflects a misunderstanding of Congress\u2019s \ndecision to borrow state-law tort principles to define \nthe tort liability that the FTCA imposes. Specifically, \nthe FTCA provides that the United States is liable in \ntort \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a \nprivate individual under like circumstances,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2674\u2014that is, it is liable \u201cunder circum-\nstances where the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the \nlaw of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 1346(b); see also id. \u00a7 2672 (using same language \nto describe authority of federal agencies to settle tort \nclaims). \nThat language, however, does not suggest that \nstate law applies of its own force to the federal govern-\nment in FTCA actions or that the resulting liability is \nliability under state law. To the contrary, state tort \nprinciples apply only because, and to the extent that, \nCongress has chosen to use them as the standard for \nthe liability that the FTCA creates. Indeed, the state-\nlaw principles that Congress incorporated to deter-\nmine the liability of the United States under the \nFTCA do so wholly without regard to whether they are \napplicable to the United States or any other govern-\nmental body under state law. For example, this Court \nlong ago held that state tort defenses and other limi-\ntations on liability applicable to government defend-\nants are not incorporated in the FTCA. See United \nStates v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 164\u201365 (1963); Indian \nTowing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 65 (1955). \nThus, the FTCA does not provide that the United \n\n \n6 \n \nStates is liable when state law says it (or government \nentities more generally) is liable, but instead that it is \nliable under circumstances similar to those in which \nstate law would say that someone else (a private per-\nson) would be liable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The imposi-\ntion of liability on the United States in such circum-\nstances does not find its source in state law, but is en-\ntirely the creation of a federal statute. \nMoreover, Congress adopted special defenses not \notherwise available under state law to ensure that its \nchoice of using state tort principles applicable to pri-\nvate actors does not impinge on federal governmental \ninterests. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680; Muniz, 374 U.S. at 163 \n(\u201cCongress has taken steps to protect the Government \nfrom liability that would seriously handicap efficient \ngovernment operations.\u201d). Those defenses, where ap-\nplicable, exclude liability for such things as the exer-\ncise of discretionary governmental functions, id. \n\u00a7 2680(a), \nnegligent \ntransmission \nof \nmail, \nid. \n\u00a7 2680(b), imposition of quarantines, id. \u00a7 2680(f); \ncommission of certain intentional torts, id. \u00a7 2680(h); \nregulation of the monetary system, id. \u00a7 2680(i), and \ncombat operations of the armed forces, id. \u00a7 2680(j). \nThe statute also incorporates certain federal govern-\nmental immunities, id. \u00a7 2674 (third paragraph), and \nexcludes constitutional torts and certain federal stat-\nutory claims, id. \u00a7 2679(b)(2). The result of this retic-\nulated federal statutory scheme is a form of liability \nthat no state purports to or could impose on the United \nStates: namely, liability in circumstances analogous \nto those under which state law would recognize pri-\nvate tort liability, but subject to defenses and other \nprocedural and substantive limitations designed by \nCongress to balance federal government interests \n\n \n7 \n \nagainst the interest in providing recovery to persons \ninjured by negligent or wrongful government actions. \nAlthough this Court has occasionally referred in \nshorthand to FTCA actions against the United States \nas involving \u201cstate-law tort suits against the Federal \nGovernment,\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, 210 \n(2021), its decisions have consistently recognized that \nthe liability of the United States in such actions is \ngrounded on federal law, in the form of a statute en-\nacted by Congress. For example, in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 \nU.S. 471 (1994), the Court observed that, through the \nFTCA\u2014and specifically through the language codified \nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)\u2014\u201cthe United States has \u2026 \u2018ren-\nder[ed]\u2019 itself liable\u201d for torts in circumstances in \nwhich state law would hold a private person liable. Id. \nat 477 (emphasis added; quoting Richards v. United \nStates, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962)). The Court has explicitly \nrecognized that \u201cwhether a private person would be \nresponsible for similar negligence under the laws of \nthe State where the acts occurred\u201d is \u201cthe test estab-\nlished by the Tort Claims Act for determining the \nUnited States\u2019 liability.\u201d Rayonier Inc. v. United \nStates, 352 U.S. 315, 319 (1957). The standard of lia-\nbility \u201cis controlled by a formal expression of the will \nof Congress,\u201d Richards, 369 U.S. at 7, which deter-\nmines the scope of the \u201cremedies provided by Con-\ngress,\u201d Muniz, 374 U.S. at 165\u201366. Thus, whether a \nprivate person would be liable for similar conduct un-\nder state tort law is one of the \u201celements\u201d of the federal \ncause of action created by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Brown-\nback, 592 U.S. at 212; see also id. at 216 (\u201c[O]ne ele-\nment of an FTCA claim is that the plaintiff establish \nthat the Government employee would be liable under \nstate law.\u201d).  \n\n \n8 \n \nThis Court\u2019s consistent readings of the FTCA con-\nfirm what is plain from the statutory language. State \nlaw itself does not impose liability under the FTCA. \nState-law principles that would apply to the liability \nof private persons are used as part of the determina-\ntion of the liability of the United States only because \na federal law duly enacted by Congress so requires. \nII. The Supremacy Clause does not limit, but \nrather requires, application of federal law. \nThe Supremacy Clause dictates that federal laws \nenacted pursuant to the Constitution are the law of \nthe land, and it resolves conflicts between the com-\nmands of federal laws and contrary state laws. The \nClause thus compels adherence to the FTCA\u2019s di-\nrective that state-law principles that would apply to \nprivate tortfeasors form the basis of the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s tort liability. The application of those prin-\nciples cannot be contrary to federal law when federal \nlaw expressly requires their application. \nThe Supremacy Clause provides that \u201c[t]his Con-\nstitution, and the Laws of the United States which \nshall be made in Pursuance thereof \u2026 shall be the su-\npreme Law of the Land; \u2026 any Thing in the Constitu-\ntion or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwith-\nstanding.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. The Supremacy \nClause requires \u201cpreemption\u201d of state laws where giv-\ning them effect would be in derogation of the suprem-\nacy of the Constitution or a valid federal law enacted \nunder it\u2014that is, where state law stands in contradic-\ntion to some applicable command of federal law. See \nMurphy v. NCAA, 584 U.S. 453, 477 (2018). All forms \nof preemption, in other words, involve \u201ca clash be-\ntween a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s legisla-\ntive power and conflicting state law.\u201d Murphy, 584 \n\n \n9 \n \nU.S. at 479. Where such a clash occurs, the Supremacy \nClause provides a \u201crule of decision\u201d: Courts must give \neffect to the federal law, not the conflicting state one. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 324 (2015).  \nMore broadly, the Constitution\u2019s creation of a sov-\nereign federal union under a government that, \u201cwithin \nits own sphere,\u201d is \u201csupreme\u201d necessarily \u201cexempt[s] \n[that government\u2019s] operations from [the] influence\u201d of \n\u201cpower vested in subordinate governments.\u201d McCul-\nloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 427 (1819). That is, \u201cthe \nactivities of the Federal Government are free from \nregulation by any state,\u201d Mayo v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 441, 445 (1943), because a \u201csubordinate sover-\neign\u201d cannot control the government of the United \nStates without its consent, Hancock v. Train, 426 U.S. \n167, 179 (1976). As this Court recently explained, \n\u201c[t]he Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause generally im-\nmunizes the Federal Government from state laws that \ndirectly regulate or discriminate against it.\u201d United \nStates v. Washington, 596 U.S. 832, 835 (2022). \nBecause preemption under the Supremacy Clause \nis always triggered by a clash between federal and \nstate law, however, the Supremacy Clause allows even \ndirect application of state regulations to the federal \ngovernment if authorized by a federal statute. In that \ncircumstance, state regulation is in conformity with, \nnot contrary to, the laws of the United States. See \nUnited States v. Washington, 596 U.S. at 839\u201340. \nLikewise, not all differences between state law and \nfederal law, or all impacts of state laws on federal gov-\nernment interests, give rise to preemption, because \nnot all involve contradictory or conflicting federal and \nstate commands. See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda Motor \nof Am., Inc., 562 U.S. 323 (2011); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 \n\n \n10 \n \nU.S. 555 (2009); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 \nU.S. 51 (2002). And where a federal law authorizes or \ncontemplates the operation of state law, the federal \nlaw does not displace state law because giving it effect, \nas the Supremacy Clause demands, requires that \nstate law not be disturbed. Put another way, state \nlaws are not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal laws that require or \npermit the state laws\u2019 operation.  \nThus, as this Court has said time and again,  \u201c[t]he \npurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u201d in de-\ntermining the preemptive effects of federal law. Retail \nClerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96, 103 \n(1963); see Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 578 \nU.S. 150, 162\u201363 (2016); Wyeth, 562 U.S. at 565. This \nproposition holds good in \u201cevery pre-emption case,\u201d \nHughes, 578 U.S. at 163, \u201c[w]hatever the category of \npreemption asserted\u201d\u2014be it express, implied, or field \npreemption. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. \n761, 785 (2019) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judg-\nment). \nIt follows that, in the first instance, \u201c \u2018[e]vidence of \npre-emptive purpose,\u2019 whether express or implied, \nmust \u2026 be \u2018sought in the text and structure of the stat-\nute at issue.\u2019 \u201d Va. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead \nopinion of Gorsuch, J.) (quoting CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nEasterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664 (1993)). Thus, a litigant \nclaiming preemption based on conflict between state \nlaw and the requirements, purposes, or objectives of \nfederal law \u201cmust point specifically to \u2018a constitutional \ntext or a federal statute\u2019 that does the displacing or \nconflicts with state law.\u201d Id. at 767 (citation omitted). \nCourts considering such claims, moreover, must re-\nspect both \u201cwhat Congress wrote\u201d and \u201cwhat it didn\u2019t \nwrite.\u201d Id. at 765. The inquiry turns on \u201cwhat can be \n\n \n11 \n \nfound in the law itself,\u201d id. at 779, not on \u201cabstract and \nunenacted legislative desires,\u201d id. at 778. \nIn light of these principles, courts must give effect \nto federal statutory provisions whose terms manifest \nan intent to allow application of state laws even when \nthose laws might otherwise be impliedly preempted \nbecause of a conflict of some kind with federal law. \nSee, e.g., Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 575; Silkwood v. Kerr-\nMcGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 256 (1984). Disregard of \nsuch statutory provisions would violate the cardinal \nrule that preemption of whatever stripe\u2014express \npreemption, implied field preemption, or implied con-\nflict preemption\u2014is always a matter of congressional \nintent discernible from statutory text and structure. \nVa. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead opinion of Gor-\nsuch, J.); id. at 785 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the \njudgment). When a federal statute allows or requires \nstate law to operate, effectuating the law enacted by \nCongress requires giving effect to its command that \nstate laws remain operative. If a federal statute does \nnot in some way require displacement of state law, \nsuch displacement cannot be necessary to ensure the \nfederal statute\u2019s \u201csupremacy.\u201d \nThus, the Court has repeatedly held that federal \nstatutes may limit or foreclose the otherwise preemp-\ntive effects of federal law. See, e.g., Calif. Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ass\u2019n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272 (1987); Malone v. \nWhite Motor Corp., 435 U.S. 497 (1978); Schermer-\nhorn, 375 U.S. 96. Such \u201cantipre-emption provisions,\u201d \nas Justice Scalia labeled them, Guerra, 479 U.S. at \n295 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), are, like \nother federal statutory commands, the law of the land \nand must be given effect under the Supremacy Clause.  \n\n \n12 \n \nIndeed, the Supremacy Clause effectively allows \nCongress to reverse the ordinary rule that federal law \npreempts conflicting state law and to provide that \nstate laws prevail in cases of conflict. For example, the \nCourt has held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \nwhich provides that no federal statute \u201cshall be con-\nstrued to invalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d state laws \nregulating the business of insurance, 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1012(b), functions as a reverse-preemption provi-\nsion: Where \u201cthere is a direct conflict between [a] fed-\neral \u2026 statute and [state] law,\u201d the \u201cterms of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act\u201d provide that \u201cfederal law \nmust yield.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, \n502 (1993). Because the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a \nlaw of the United States enacted pursuant to the Con-\nstitution, the Supremacy Clause dictates that its re-\nquirement that state law prevail over otherwise appli-\ncable federal law must be given effect. \nApplication of these principles allows no room for \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the Supremacy \nClause overrides Congress\u2019s choice to impose liability \non the United States in circumstances where state tort \nlaw would make a private person liable. Indeed, this \ncase is easier from a Supremacy Clause standpoint \nthan cases involving \u201canti-preemption\u201d or \u201creverse \npreemption\u201d statutory provisions because here, unlike \nin those cases, Congress is not simply permitting state \nlaw to operate of its own force in areas where it argu-\nably comes into conflict with federal law. Rather, in \nenacting the FTCA, Congress unambiguously pre-\nscribed use of tort-law principles derived from state \nlaw as the federal rule of decision in cases arising un-\nder a federal statute. Where, as in this case, a \u201cLaw[ ] \nof the United States made in Pursuance\u201d of the Con-\nstitution prescribes a standard of liability, the \n\n \n13 \n \nSupremacy Clause makes that prescription \u201cthe su-\npreme Law of the Land\u201d and binds courts to follow it. \nU.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. Moreover, the application of \nthat standard\u2014even if it were being applied as the \nlaw of a state rather than as federal law\u2014could not \npossibly be considered \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal law when \nfederal law requires its application. The assertion that \na statute that adopts state laws as federal rules of de-\ncision manifests an intent to displace those laws is \nnonsensical. \nTo be sure, if a principle of state tort law were \npreempted or otherwise unconstitutional as applied to \nprivate persons, the FTCA would not mandate its ap-\nplication in a suit against the United States. That re-\nsult, however, would not follow from the Supremacy \nClause, but from the terms of the FTCA, which com-\nmand that (subject to the exceptions set forth in the \nstatute) courts hold the United States liable \u201cto the \nsame extent as a private individual under like circum-\nstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. If a rule of state tort liabil-\nity were unconstitutional as applied to private individ-\nuals, such individuals would not be liable under the \ncircumstances addressed by that rule, and therefore \nthe United States also could not be held liable in those \ncircumstances by the FTCA\u2019s plain terms.  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 application of the Supremacy \nClause, however, is not based on any supposed consti-\ntutional infirmity in the application of relevant state \ntort-law principles to private individuals. Rather, it \nposits that tort-law principles valid as to private indi-\nviduals may not, under the Supremacy Clause, be ap-\nplied to the federal government because doing so \nwould interfere with the lawful operation of the gov-\nernment. That view cannot be squared with the Su-\npremacy Clause because it fails to give effect to a law \n\n \n14 \n \nenacted by Congress, which the Supremacy Clause \nbinds courts to treat as paramount.2 \nIII. Supremacy \nClause \nimplied-preemption \nprinciples do not apply to asserted conflicts \nbetween or among federal laws. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s case law, in the guise of en-\nforcing the Supremacy Clause, holds a federal statu-\ntory requirement unenforceable because of a perceived \nconflict with the purposes and objectives of other (un-\nspecified) federal laws. Specifically, the court has held \nthat imposing liability based on the state-law tort \nprinciples whose application is called for by the FTCA \nis prohibited when the activity in which federal em-\nployees were engaged when they committed the alleg-\nedly tortious acts that injured the plaintiffs has \u201csome \nnexus with furthering federal policy and can reasona-\nbly be characterized as complying with the full range \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n2 Taken seriously, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that Suprem-\nacy Clause principles must be applied in FTCA cases as if state \ntort-law principles apply to claims against the United States of \ntheir own force would nullify the FTCA\u2019s standard of liability. \nBecause states cannot unilaterally impose tort liability on the \nfederal government, the FTCA operates only because the United \nStates has the power to impose liability on itself based on state \ntort-law principles that could not otherwise be applied to the \nUnited States under the Supremacy Clause. Presumably, the \nEleventh Circuit does not think that the FTCA\u2019s standard of lia-\nbility is preempted in every case: It has continued to entertain \nsome FTCA actions asserting claims that the United States is \nliable for conduct that would be actionable under state law if per-\nformed by a private person. See, e.g., Smith v. United States, 7 \nF.4th 963 (11th Cir. 2021). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s apparent view \nthat the Supremacy Clause permits Congress to incorporate \nsome otherwise preempted state tort-law principles into the \nFTCA but not others lacks a principled basis for distinguishing \nwhich state-law principles can permissibly be incorporated and \nwhich cannot. \n\n \n15 \n \nof federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. The Eleventh Circuit \nexplicitly based this standard on this Court\u2019s \u201cpur-\nposes and objectives\u201d implied-preemption jurispru-\ndence. See Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293 (quoting Hines, \n312 U.S. at 67). That doctrine, controversial even in \ncases posing genuine Supremacy Clause issues arising \nfrom claimed conflicts between federal and state law, \nsee Kansas v. Garcia, 589 U.S. 191, 213 (2020) \n(Thomas, J., concurring), has no place in resolving \nclaimed conflicts or tensions among federal laws. \nAs this Court explained in POM Wonderful LLC v. \nCoca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102 (2014), cases involving \n\u201cthe alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one \nfederal statute by the provisions of another federal \nstatute\u201d (or, here, by the emanations of the entire body \nof federal law) are not governed by the Supremacy \nClause or by \u201cthe Court\u2019s complex categorization of the \ntypes of pre-emption.\u201d Id. at 111. Rather, resolving \ntensions within the body of federal laws is an issue of \n\u201cstatutory interpretation\u201d to which courts must apply \n\u201ctraditional rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d Id. at \n112. Those rules include the standards for determin-\ning whether one statute has been impliedly repealed \nby another whose terms are in irreconcilable conflict, \nand the canons of construction for determining \nwhether a more specific law clarifies or narrows a \nmore general law. See id. \nHere the Court need not delve into such issues in \ndetail because the applicable question presented is \nlimited to whether the Supremacy Clause bars appli-\ncation of the FTCA\u2019s standard of liability. Moreover, \nbecause the court of appeals did not purport to identify \nany basis in ordinary principles of statutory construc-\ntion for reading into the FTCA a broad exception for \nactions that have \u201csome nexus\u201d with federal policy and \n\n \n16 \n \ncan \u201creasonably be characterized as complying with \nthe full range of federal law,\u201d this Court need not ad-\ndress the merits of any such hypothetical justification \nfor the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. \nNonetheless, it is highly unlikely that traditional \nprinciples of statutory construction could ever justify \na limitation of the FTCA comparable to that imposed \nby the Eleventh Circuit. No ordinary canon of statu-\ntory construction allows a federal statute\u2019s unambigu-\nous choice of a standard of liability to be overridden by \na court\u2019s view of the unenacted purposes and objec-\ntives of federal law generally. The court of appeals\u2019 ap-\nproach reflects a sweeping assumption of authority to \ngo \u201caround or behind the words of the controlling text.\u201d \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law 18 \n(2012). And the court\u2019s appeal to purposes and objec-\ntives to override the text of a statutory provision at-\ntempts not just to \u201cachieve what [the court] believes to \nbe th[at] provision\u2019s purpose,\u201d id., but instead to \nachieve the purposes of federal law as a whole, unteth-\nered to the terms of any statute ever enacted by Con-\ngress. If such reliance on \u201csome brooding federal inter-\nest\u201d does not justify preemption of state law, Va. Ura-\nnium, 587 U.S. at 767 (lead opinion), it surely cannot \novercome the plain terms of a federal statute.  \nThe result of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding is the \ncreation of a broad and amorphous exception to the \nstatute potentially applicable to almost any case. In-\nnumerable federal actions have some \u201cnexus\u201d to fed-\neral policy and can at least be \u201ccharacterized\u201d as con-\nsistent with the \u201cfull range of federal law.\u201d Adopting \nsuch a sweeping exception to liability is inconsistent \nwith the many carefully crafted defenses already built \ninto the FTCA, and with this Court\u2019s approach to con-\nstruing it over the decades since its enactment\u2014an \n\n \n17 \n \napproach reflecting the view that \u201c[t]here is no justifi-\ncation for this Court to read exemptions into the Act \nbeyond those provided by Congress\u201d and that \u201c[i]f the \nAct is to be altered that is a function for the same body \nthat adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the \ncourt of appeals. \nRespectfully submitted, \nSCOTT L.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a `THINK` action, which represents my internal reasoning after processing the U.S. government's \"Brief for the Respondents in Opposition\" (BIO). As this observation is a summary of the analysis that led to my current belief state, it introduces no new external facts or evidence. Therefore, my beliefs remain stable, but the reasoning is reaffirmed. My understanding of the case, built upon all prior observations, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The core facts of the mistaken FBI raid on the Martin family's home are undisputed by both parties and form the stable foundation of the case.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Contextualized):** My understanding of the Eleventh Circuit's decision is no longer viewed in isolation. The government's BIO defends the *outcome* (dismissal) more than the specific reasoning. This suggests the government sees the lower court's novel Supremacy Clause theory as one of several potential paths to victory, not necessarily the most defensible one.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Dramatically Sharpened):** The BIO has provided the crucial counterarguments to the petitioners' case, transforming my understanding of the legal battlefield from a one-sided petition to a two-sided conflict.\n\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):**\n        *   **Prior Belief:** The Eleventh Circuit's theory seemed novel and likely to be reversed.\n        *   **Current Belief (Post-BIO):** My belief is now more nuanced. The government is not simply defending the lower court's logic but is advancing a more sophisticated theory of implied preemption. Their argument is that if federal agents' conduct is deemed \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment (as it was in the qualified immunity analysis), then state tort law cannot impose liability on the U.S. government for that conduct. This frames the conflict as state tort law interfering with the execution of federal duties that are already compliant with the supreme law of the Constitution. This provides the Court with a more plausible, though still controversial, basis to affirm.\n\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions: Discretionary Function vs. Law Enforcement Proviso):**\n        *   **Prior Belief:** The petitioners' textualist argument (\"specific over general\") seemed strong, especially given the deep circuit split on whether the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) trumps the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)).\n        *   **Current Belief (Post-BIO):** The government has introduced a pivotal strategic argument that attempts to sidestep this direct conflict. Their \"antecedent negligence\" theory posits that the legally relevant wrongful act was not the intentional tort of assault/battery during the raid, but the *negligent planning* that preceded it (e.g., site identification, navigation). They argue this planning phase is a classic discretionary function, protected under the *United States v. Gaubert* test, as it involves policy judgments about safety, secrecy, and resource allocation. This creates a pathway for the Court to affirm the dismissal by finding the claim is barred by the discretionary function exception before even reaching the intentional torts covered by the proviso.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Updated and Balanced):**\n    *   **Certiorari Grant (Re-contextualized):** The grant remains a strong signal that at least four justices found the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning problematic. However, the government's \"antecedent negligence\" argument introduces the significant possibility of a \"reverse and affirm\" outcome, where the Court rejects the Eleventh Circuit's specific legal theories but affirms the judgment on the alternative grounds that the claim is barred by the discretionary function exception.\n    *   **Circuit Split (Nuanced):** The split on the interaction between \u00a7 2680(a) and \u00a7 2680(h) is a major reason the Court took the case. However, the government's strategy is to argue that the split is not dispositive here. They contend that the claim arises from antecedent negligence, an issue they believe would be decided in their favor even in circuits that hold the proviso generally trumps the exception. The key predictive question is whether the Court will accept this off-ramp or use the case to resolve the split head-on.\n    *   **Petitioners' Arguments (Counterbalanced):** The petitioners' clear, text-focused arguments are now met with the government's granular, fact-based defense that severs the operation into a protected \"planning\" stage and an \"execution\" stage.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Stable):** The most crucial pieces of evidence for refining my prediction are the forthcoming merits briefs. The **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief** will provide the definitive and fully developed version of their arguments, potentially refining or altering the \"antecedent negligence\" theory from the BIO. Subsequently, the **Petitioners' Reply Brief** will be essential to see how they counter this specific theory. **Amicus briefs** will also be highly informative for gauging the broader legal and policy implications perceived by outside groups.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the amicus curiae brief filed by Public Citizen in support of the petitioners. This brief provides significant new legal arguments and signals, primarily focused on the first legal question, which necessitates a substantial update to my beliefs. My understanding of the case now incorporates these new arguments.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The core facts of the mistaken FBI raid remain undisputed and stable.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Further Undermined):** My prior belief was that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause theory was novel and likely to be reversed. The Public Citizen amicus brief provides a comprehensive and powerful argument that this theory is not just novel, but fundamentally incorrect as a matter of constitutional law. This significantly strengthens my belief that the Court will reject the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Refined and Re-weighted):** The introduction of a sophisticated amicus brief sharpens the arguments and shifts the likely focus of the Court's decision.\n\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):**\n        *   **Prior Belief:** The government's sophisticated \"implied preemption\" theory provided a plausible, though controversial, path for the Court to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's judgment on this question.\n        *   **Current Belief (Post-Amicus Brief):** My confidence in a reversal on Question 1 has substantially increased. The Public Citizen brief systematically deconstructs the entire premise of applying Supremacy Clause preemption in this context. It makes three key points that are likely to be highly persuasive:\n            1.  **FTCA Liability is Federal:** The brief argues forcefully that the Eleventh Circuit erred by treating an FTCA claim as a \"suit under state law.\" It clarifies that the FTCA creates a *federal* cause of action that merely *borrows* state law principles as the standard for liability. The liability itself is imposed by a federal statute, not by the state.\n            2.  **The Supremacy Clause is a Federal-State Conflict Rule:** The brief contends the Eleventh Circuit turned the Supremacy Clause \"upside-down.\" The clause is a rule of decision that makes federal law supreme over *contrary state law*. It cannot be used to invalidate a federal statute (the FTCA) based on a perceived conflict with other general federal policies. In fact, the Supremacy Clause *requires* courts to apply the FTCA as the \"supreme Law of the Land.\"\n            3.  **Intra-Federal Conflicts are Matters of Statutory Interpretation:** The brief directly counters the government's potential argument by stating that any tension between the FTCA and other federal laws or policies is an ordinary matter of statutory construction, not a constitutional Supremacy Clause issue. Resolving such tensions involves canons like the specific governing the general, not preemption doctrine.\n        *   **Impact:** These arguments frame the Eleventh Circuit's decision as a fundamental category error. This makes it much more likely that the Court will unanimously or near-unanimously reverse on Question 1. The government's path to victory on this question now appears exceedingly narrow.\n\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions: Discretionary Function vs. Law Enforcement Proviso):**\n        *   **Prior Belief:** The government's \"antecedent negligence\" theory was a pivotal strategic argument that created an \"off-ramp\" for the Court to affirm dismissal without resolving the deep circuit split.\n        *   **Current Belief (Stable but more Central):** The Public Citizen brief is silent on this question. Its exclusive focus on the Supremacy Clause reinforces the idea that the two questions are legally distinct. This silence has the effect of elevating the importance of Question 2. As the petitioners' position on Question 1 is significantly strengthened, the entire case now likely pivots to whether the government can succeed on its \"antecedent negligence\" argument under Question 2. The viability of the government's off-ramp remains the central unresolved issue.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Updated and Re-weighted):**\n    *   **Certiorari Grant (Contextualized):** The grant remains a strong signal. The Public Citizen brief provides a clear roadmap for *why* at least four justices saw a reversible error, suggesting the cert grant was aimed squarely at correcting the Eleventh Circuit's misuse of the Supremacy Clause.\n    *   **Circuit Split (Importance Reinforced):** While the Public Citizen brief doesn't address the split, its successful demolition of the Supremacy Clause argument makes it more likely the Court will have to confront the statutory interpretation question. The government's \"antecedent negligence\" theory is an attempt to sidestep the split, but the Court may choose to resolve it directly. My prediction now hinges more heavily on whether the Court accepts the government's framing or decides to create a uniform national rule on the interaction between \u00a7 2680(a) and \u00a7 2680(h).\n    *   **\"Reverse and Affirm\" Scenario (Probability Increased):** The strength of the arguments against the Supremacy Clause holding, combined with the continued viability of the government's \"antecedent negligence\" theory, makes a \"reverse and affirm\" outcome a more probable scenario. The Court could write an opinion that strongly repudiates the Eleventh Circuit's constitutional analysis but ultimately concludes that the specific facts of this case (negligent planning) fall under the discretionary function exception, thus affirming the dismissal of the suit on statutory grounds.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Stable and Refocused):** The need for the parties' merits briefs is now even more critical, but my focus has shifted. The **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief** is crucial to see if they double down on a Supremacy Clause argument in the face of this strong criticism, or if they pivot almost entirely to their \"antecedent negligence\" theory. The **Petitioners' Reply Brief** will be essential for seeing the first direct rebuttal to the government's fully-formed statutory argument, a task this amicus brief did not undertake.",

My belief is that the case outcome hinges on the statutory interpretation of the FTCA's exceptions (Question 2), specifically the government's 'antecedent negligence' argument. This search for the Respondent's merits brief will provide the definitive articulation of that argument, which is the most critical missing piece of evidence.\n\nTask EIG is extremely high (0.95) because the brief will either confirm the weakness of the Supremacy Clause argument (solidifying my belief on Question 1) and, more importantly, will provide the full legal architecture for the government's dispositive statutory argument. This will dramatically reduce uncertainty and allow for a much more precise prediction of the Court's potential reasoning for a 'reverse and affirm' outcome.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because it provides a canonical example of a crucial step in the prediction workflow: analyzing the respondent's strategy when defending a lower court victory on shaky grounds. Observing how the Solicitor General pivots from a weak constitutional argument to a stronger statutory one provides invaluable, generalizable data for modeling government litigation strategy and identifying 'off-ramp' arguments in future cases.",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal thought process, a summary of my analysis of the prior observation (the Public Citizen amicus brief). It contains no new external information, evidence, or legal arguments about the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, and this observation serves to confirm and solidify the conclusions reached in the previous update.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The core facts of the mistaken FBI raid on the Martin family's home remain undisputed.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Belief in Reversal Solidified):** My belief that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause reasoning will be overturned remains very strong. The observation reaffirms my assessment that the Public Citizen amicus brief provided a devastating critique, framing the lower court's decision as a fundamental misunderstanding of both the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and the Supremacy Clause itself.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Beliefs Stable and Confirmed):** My understanding of the case's central pivot points is unchanged. The observation confirms my strategic shift in focus from Question 1 to Question 2.\n\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):** My confidence in a reversal on this question is at its highest point. The arguments that FTCA liability is federal (not state), that the Supremacy Clause governs federal-state conflicts (not intra-federal ones), and that tensions between federal statutes are resolved through statutory interpretation (not constitutional preemption) appear dispositive. The observation confirms my view that the government has a very difficult path to victory on this question.\n\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions: Discretionary Function vs. Law Enforcement Proviso):** My belief that this question is now the crux of the case is reinforced. With Question 1 likely to be resolved in the petitioners' favor, the outcome of the case will almost certainly hinge on the statutory interpretation of the FTCA's exceptions. The government's \"antecedent negligence\" argument\u2014that the planning of the raid is protected discretionary conduct separate from the execution\u2014remains the key \"off-ramp\" that could allow the Court to affirm the dismissal on other grounds.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Stable):**\n    *   **Certiorari Grant (Contextualized):** My interpretation of the cert grant as a signal of reversible error, specifically on the novel Supremacy Clause issue, remains unchanged.\n    *   **Circuit Split (Importance Elevated):** The likely reversal on Question 1 makes it more probable that the Court will have to engage with the statutory question at the heart of the circuit split. The observation confirms my assessment that the case now pivots on whether the Court accepts the government's \"antecedent negligence\" theory to sidestep the split or decides to resolve it directly.\n    *   **\"Reverse and Affirm\" Scenario (Probability Stable):** The probability of a \"reverse and affirm\" outcome remains elevated. The Court can strongly reject the Eleventh Circuit's constitutional analysis (the reversal on Question 1) while still finding for the government on statutory grounds by accepting the discretionary function argument (the affirmance of the dismissal).\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Focus Sharpened):** The observation explicitly confirms my information-seeking strategy. The most critical missing evidence is the merits briefing from the primary parties. My focus is now acutely aimed at the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief**. This document is essential to learn:\n    *   Whether the government will concede the weakness of the Supremacy Clause argument or attempt to defend it.\n    *   The full legal architecture of their \"antecedent negligence\" argument under the discretionary function exception, which is now the central battleground of the case.",

It solidifies the belief that Question 1 will be reversed and Question 2 is the new focus, but it doesn't provide new evidence to resolve the uncertainty around Question 2. The value lies in correctly re-calibrating the problem and identifying the next critical information need (the Petitioners' Merits Brief), which is a necessary but low-information-gain step in itself.\n\nDesign EIG (0.5): The EIG is moderate because the thought process demonstrates a crucial and generalizable strategic insight for SCOTUS prediction: recognizing and reacting to a 'confession and avoidance' strategy by a litigant, particularly the Solicitor General. This action models the importance of shifting predictive focus from a conceded question to the proposed alternative grounds for affirmance. Articulating this pivot from a constitutional to a statutory question and identifying the 'Reverse and Affirm' scenario as the government's goal is a valuable, reusable pattern for the agent's overall design.\n\nJoint EIG (0.7): The overall value comes primarily from the design-level insight. The action is a high-quality step in the reasoning process that makes the agent's strategy more robust and explicit, even if it doesn't directly bring in new facts to resolve the case's ultimate outcome.",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation is the \"BRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENTS IN OPPOSITION\" filed by the U.S. Solicitor General. This is a primary source document of the highest relevance, as it contains the government's official legal arguments presented to the Supreme Court before certiorari was granted. It provides the first direct insight into the government's legal strategy and significantly updates my understanding of the case's dynamics.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The government's brief accepts the core facts of the mistaken raid as presented by the petitioners and the lower courts. The factual basis for the prediction remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Belief in Reversal Becomes Near-Certainty):** My prior belief that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding would be reversed has now solidified into a near-certainty. The government's brief is a classic \"confession and avoidance\" argument. It does not mount a serious defense of the lower court's constitutional reasoning. Instead, it states that while the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning \"differs from the approach of other circuits,\" this \"disagreement did not affect the proper disposition of the case.\" This is a tacit concession that the Supremacy Clause analysis was erroneous. The government is explicitly asking the Court to look past the flawed reasoning and affirm the judgment on alternative statutory grounds. This is the strongest possible signal that the government expects to lose on Question 1 and has staked its entire case on winning Question 2.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Beliefs Sharpened and Re-calibrated):** The government's brief confirms that the case pivots entirely from the constitutional question to the statutory one, and it clearly articulates the government's theory for why it should still win.\n\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):** This issue is now effectively resolved for predictive purposes. The government has all but abandoned the argument. I can now predict with very high confidence that the Court will unanimously or near-unanimously reverse the Eleventh Circuit's holding that the Supremacy Clause bars FTCA claims. The Court granted certiorari to correct this novel and significant error, and the respondent is not defending it.\n\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions: Discretionary Function vs. Law Enforcement Proviso):** My belief that this is the crux of the case is fully confirmed. The government's brief is a detailed roadmap of its argument on this point.\n        *   **Government's Core Argument Identified:** The government's strategy is to characterize all of the petitioners' claims as \"arising out of\" the discretionary planning of the raid, thereby bringing them under the protection of the Discretionary Function Exception (DFE, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)). They argue that the agents' decisions on how to prepare for the warrant\u2014how to conduct surveillance, when to do a drive-by, how to balance secrecy with accuracy\u2014were discretionary judgments \"susceptible to policy analysis\" (*United States v. Gaubert*).\n        *   **\"Antecedent Negligence\" Theory Confirmed:** This confirms my hypothesis. The government argues that the mistaken entry and subsequent torts (assault, battery) were the direct result of this protected discretionary planning. Therefore, even the intentional torts covered by the Law Enforcement Proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) are barred because the claim as a whole is rooted in a discretionary function. This legal theory is the heart of the circuit split the Court will now have to address.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Refined):**\n    *   **Certiorari Grant (Interpretation Confirmed):** The grant was clearly to correct the outlier Supremacy Clause holding, with the statutory question coming along as the necessary next step to resolve the case.\n    *   **Circuit Split (Centrality Confirmed):** The government's brief does not shy away from the circuit split; it leans into it, arguing that its interpretation\u2014that the DFE can bar claims involving proviso torts if they arise from antecedent discretionary acts\u2014is the correct one. The case is now squarely a vehicle for resolving this split.\n    *   **\"Reverse and Affirm\" Scenario (Probability Greatly Increased):** The government's brief is structured as a direct appeal for this outcome. It provides the Justices with a clear path to: (1) **Reverse** on the broadly consequential Supremacy Clause issue, correcting a significant constitutional error, and then (2) **Affirm** the dismissal of this specific case on the statutory grounds of the DFE. This outcome would be a narrow victory for the government, protecting it from liability here, while also providing clarity on the FTCA's structure. This is now the most probable disposition of the case.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Focus Shifted):** Having seen the government's core strategy, the most critical missing evidence is now the **Petitioners' Merits Brief**. That document must now accomplish two things:\n    *   Briefly acknowledge the government's concession on the Supremacy Clause.\n    *   Mount a robust counter-argument to the government's \"antecedent negligence\" theory. They will need to argue that the Law Enforcement Proviso is a specific exception that overrides the general DFE, and that the torts of assault and battery did not \"arise out of\" the planning but out of the distinct, non-discretionary operational failure of entering the wrong home. The focus of my information-seeking will now be on how the petitioners and their amici attempt to dismantle the government's statutory argument.",

United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

The district \ncourt\u2019s opinion, granting the government reconsidera-\ntion and dismissing the case, Pet. App. 20a, is unre-\nported but available as Martin v. United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 517, 536 (2008) (discussing how the \nFTCA was made retroactive because Congress wanted to provide \nrecovery for the Empire State Building crash victims); see also 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (making the FTCA effective for claims \u201caccruing \non and after January 1, 1945\u201d). \n\n34 \n \n \nperson not unduly sensitive as to his dignity.\u201d Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted). See also Ga. Code Ann. 51-1-13.\n11 \nTo determine whether the government is liable for \nbattery during a wrong-house raid, a court need not \nevaluate the legitimacy of any governmental policies. \nWe know this, in large part, because the FBI has no pol-\nicies governing the execution of SWAT raids. See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a). Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 335 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part). Three decades later, \u201ccourts are \nstill struggling.\u201d Xi, 68 F.4th at 842 (Bibas, J., concur-\nring). Third Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas recently ob-\nserved that there is still \u201csignificant confusion about \nhow to apply the test,\u201d leading to \u201cat least three \nlongstanding, recurring circuit splits involving the dis-\ncretionary-function exception.\u201d Id. at 843. Cf. Carter v. \nUnited States, 604 U.S. ___, 145 S. Ct. 519, 524 (2025) \n(mem.) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of cert.) \n(\u201cFaced with almost four decades of silence from this \nCourt on the Feres doctrine, lower courts have devel-\noped an array of tests for determining when it is trig-\ngered, leading to inconsistent results on similar facts.\u201d). \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal reasoning step, a `THINK` action, which summarizes and confirms the conclusions drawn from the previously analyzed \"BRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENTS IN OPPOSITION.\" As this observation does not introduce new external evidence, facts, or signals, my task-level beliefs remain stable and are reinforced by this internal confirmation.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The undisputed facts of the mistaken raid remain the foundation for the legal analysis. The government's brief did not contest the petitioners' account of the events.\n\n2.  **Lower Court's Legal Rationale (Belief in Reversal Remains Near-Certainty):** My belief that the Supreme Court will reverse the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding is unchanged and remains at a level of near-certainty. The government's brief in opposition explicitly chose not to defend this reasoning, instead arguing the court's judgment was correct on other grounds. This is a clear signal that the government has conceded this point and expects to lose on Question 1. The Court's primary motivation for granting certiorari appears to be the correction of this novel and significant constitutional error.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Conflicts for SCOTUS (Beliefs Stable and Sharpened):** My understanding of the case's central pivot from the constitutional to the statutory question is confirmed.\n    *   **Question 1 (Supremacy Clause):** This issue is effectively settled for predictive purposes. I predict a unanimous or near-unanimous reversal of the Eleventh Circuit on this question.\n    *   **Question 2 (FTCA Exceptions):** This remains the central battleground. My beliefs about the competing arguments are stable:\n        *   **Government's Position:** The government's entire case now rests on its \"antecedent negligence\" theory. It argues that the agents' tortious actions (assault, battery) \"arise out of\" the discretionary planning of the raid. Because the planning is protected by the Discretionary Function Exception (DFE, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)), the government claims immunity for all resulting harms, even those intentional torts that would otherwise be actionable under the Law Enforcement Proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)).\n        *   **Petitioners' Necessary Counter:** The petitioners must argue that the Law Enforcement Proviso operates as a specific carve-out that overrides the general DFE in this context. Their success will depend on persuading the Court that the torts did not \"arise out of\" the protected planning, but rather out of a distinct, non-discretionary operational failure\u2014the act of raiding the wrong house.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Known Arguments (Stable):**\n    *   **Certiorari Grant:** My interpretation that the grant was to correct the Supremacy Clause error, bringing the statutory question along with it, is solidified.\n    *   **Circuit Split:** The case is now clearly a vehicle to resolve the split on whether the DFE can bar claims for torts listed in the Law Enforcement Proviso when those torts are preceded by a discretionary act.\n    *   **\"Reverse and Affirm\" Scenario:** This remains the most probable outcome. The government has provided the Court a clear path to reverse on the constitutional question (a win for the rule of law) while affirming the dismissal of the suit on statutory grounds (a narrow win for the government). This disposition would resolve the circuit split in the government's favor while correcting the lower court's broader error.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Unchanged):** The most valuable piece of information to update my beliefs further remains the **Petitioners' Merits Brief**. This document is essential to understand the strength and nature of the legal arguments against the government's DFE theory. My focus is now entirely on how the petitioners will attempt to dismantle the \"antecedent negligence\" argument and convince the Court that the Law Enforcement Proviso must apply to the agents' actions on the scene.",

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the \"BRIEF FOR PETITIONERS\" is a highly significant observation, providing the critical missing evidence I previously identified. It substantially sharpens my understanding of the legal battleground and adjusts my predictive probabilities. My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The factual basis of the case\u2014the mistaken FBI raid on the Martin family's home\u2014remains undisputed. The petitioners' brief recounts these facts to frame the human cost and the importance of the legal remedy they seek.\n\n2.  **Question 1: Supremacy Clause (Belief in Reversal Solidified to Near-Certainty):** My prior belief that the Court will unanimously or near-unanimously reverse the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding is now cemented. The petitioners' brief dedicates only a small, final section to this question (Argument II, p. 47), treating it as a self-evident and paradoxical error (\"The Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA claims because the FTCA is a federal statute.\"). This confirms that all parties, and likely the Court, view this as the non-controversial part of the case, granted certiorari primarily to correct a significant and novel constitutional mistake by the lower court.\n\n3.  **Question 2: FTCA Exceptions (Beliefs Sharpened, Probabilities Shifted):** This is where the petitioners' brief provides the most crucial new information, presenting a powerful, two-pronged argument that directly attacks the government's expected defense and the reasoning of most circuit courts.\n    *   **New Core Argument (Petitioners):** The petitioners' primary argument is that the Discretionary Function Exception (DFE, \u00a7 2680(a)) is **\"categorically inapplicable\"** to claims brought under the Law Enforcement Proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). This is a much stronger and more fundamental challenge than merely carving out a narrow exception.\n        *   **No Statutory Conflict:** They argue that the two provisions address \"categorically distinct\" classes of conduct. The DFE immunizes government actions based on \"considerations of public policy\" (*Gaubert*, *Varig Airlines*). In contrast, the Proviso waives immunity for common-law torts like assault and battery. The petitioners assert that committing assault and battery during a raid on the wrong house is not a policy decision susceptible to DFE protection.\n        *   **Undermining \"Antecedent Negligence\":** This \"categorically inapplicable\" framework is a direct assault on the government's \"antecedent negligence\" theory. The petitioners argue that the government cannot use protected *planning* (a discretionary function) to immunize the distinct, non-discretionary, and tortious *execution* of that plan, especially when the resulting torts are the very ones Congress specified in the Proviso.\n    *   **New Fallback Argument (Petitioners):** As a secondary position, the brief argues that if the Court *does* find a conflict between the DFE and the Proviso, the Proviso must prevail. They base this on established canons of statutory interpretation:\n        *   **Specific over General:** The Proviso is a specific waiver of immunity for six intentional torts by law enforcement, whereas the DFE is a general exception.\n        *   **Later Enactment:** The Proviso was enacted in 1974 specifically to address abuses like those in the infamous \"Collinsville raids,\" long after the DFE was passed in 1946. This legislative history shows a clear congressional intent to create a remedy that should not be nullified by a pre-existing, general exception.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Scenario Analysis (Shift in Probabilities):**\n    *   **\"Reverse and Affirm\" Scenario Weakened:** My prior belief that a \"reverse and affirm\" was the most probable outcome is now significantly weakened. The petitioners have provided the Court with a robust, textually-grounded argument for a full reversal. Their \"categorically inapplicable\" theory is clean, avoids a messy balancing test, and vindicates the clear purpose of the 1974 Law Enforcement Proviso.\n    *   **\"Full Reversal\" Scenario Strengthened:** The probability of a full reversal (reversing on both the Supremacy Clause and the FTCA issue) has increased substantially. This outcome would correct the constitutional error *and* resolve the circuit split in a way that gives full effect to the Proviso, holding that the DFE cannot be used to shield the government from liability for the intentional torts listed in \u00a7 2680(h).\n    *   **Justices to Watch:** The petitioners' arguments, rooted in statutory text, structure, and history, are designed to appeal to textualist and originalist justices. The argument that the lower courts have \"overridden the legislature\u2019s prerogative\" (p. 4) is a direct appeal to judicial restraint and separation of powers.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Updated):** The focus now shifts. Having received the petitioners' opening salvo, the most valuable piece of information to update my beliefs is now the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief**. I will be looking specifically for how the government counters the \"categorically inapplicable\" argument. Will they argue that planning and execution are inseparable? Or will they argue that the Proviso is subordinate to the DFE for other structural reasons? Their response will be determinative for the next phase of my prediction.",

This action directly targets and will resolve that primary uncertainty. The content of this brief could either solidify my current belief in a full reversal (if the government's argument is weak) or dramatically shift it towards a 'reverse and affirm' outcome (if they present a compelling, unforeseen argument). Therefore, the potential for a significant update to my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) is maximal, warranting a Task EIG of 1.0. The Design EIG is also high because successfully acquiring and processing the opposing merits brief is a fundamental and essential step in any SCOTUS prediction methodology.

The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

It does not introduce new external evidence about the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, reinforced by this internal check. My understanding of the case is unchanged from my analysis of the Petitioners' Merits Brief.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The core facts of the mistaken FBI raid remain the undisputed foundation of the case.\n\n2.  **Question 1: Supremacy Clause (Stable; Near-Certain Reversal):** My belief remains firm that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding will be reversed, likely unanimously or near-unanimously. The petitioners' brief treated this as a straightforward error, and the lack of any contradictory signal reinforces this view. This is the procedural cleanup portion of the case.\n\n3.  **Question 2: FTCA Exceptions (Stable; Awaiting Counterargument):** My understanding of the central legal conflict is stable and well-defined. The petitioners have advanced a powerful, text-based argument that the Discretionary Function Exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is **\"categorically inapplicable\"** to the intentional torts waived by the Law Enforcement Proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). Their fallback argument, based on the \"specific-over-general\" and \"later-enacted\" canons of statutory interpretation, provides a second strong textual basis for reversal. The entire predictive weight of this question now rests on how the government will respond.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Scenario Analysis (Stable):** My probabilistic assessment remains the same.\n    *   **Full Reversal (High Probability):** The petitioners' strong arguments have made a full reversal on both questions the most likely outcome. This path offers the Court a clean, text-based resolution that clarifies the FTCA and resolves a circuit split.\n    *   **Reverse and Affirm (Lower Probability):** The probability of this outcome remains diminished. For the Court to affirm on the FTCA issue, the government would need to present an exceptionally compelling argument that the Discretionary Function Exception's protection for planning *must* override the Law Enforcement Proviso's specific waiver for tortious execution.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Confirmed):** The internal reasoning step confirms that my information-gathering strategy is correct. The single most valuable piece of evidence to update my beliefs is now the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) Merits Brief**. My predictive model is primed to receive and analyze the government's counterarguments to the petitioners' \"categorically inapplicable\" theory. The government's strategy will be the next major input to refine my prediction.",

W., A MINOR , ET AL . v. UNITED STATES ET AL . \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 24\u2013362. Argued April 29, 2025\u2014Decided June 12, 2025 \nOn October 18, 2017, the FBI raided the wrong house in suburban At -\nlanta.  Officers meant to execute search and arrest warrants at a sus-\npected gang hideout at 3741 Landau Lane but instead stormed 3756 \nDenville Trace, a quiet family home  occupied by petitioners Hilliard\nToi Cliatt, his partner Curtrina Martin, and her 7-year-old son.  A six-\nmember SWAT team breached the front door, detonated a flash-bang\ngrenade, and assaulted the innocent occupants before realizing their mistake. The cause of the error was Special Agent Guerra\u2019s reliance \non a personal GPS device, combined with the team\u2019s failure to notice the street sign for \u201cDenville Trace\u201d  and the house number visible on \nthe mailbox.  Left with personal in juries and property damage, peti-\ntioners sued the United States und er the Federal Tort Claims Act \n(FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72671 et seq. , seeking damages re sulting from the\nofficers\u2019 alleged negligent and intentional actions during the raid.  The \ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the government.  The \nEleventh Circuit affirmed, applyi ng a unique approach to FTCA \nclaims.  \nThe FTCA waives the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity \nfrom suit as to certain torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment .  But that waiver is subject to\nstatutory exceptions, including two relevant to a law enforcement mis-\nconduct case like this one. The firs t is the intentional-tort exception \nin \u00a72680(h), which bars claims against the government for 11 enumer -\nated intentional torts.  The second is the discretionary-function excep-\ntion in \u00a72680(a), which bars claims against the government that are \nbased on an official\u2019s exercise of  discretionary functions.  Section \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n 2 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \n2680(h) also contains a \u201claw enforcement proviso\u201d which counter -\nmands the intentional-tort exception,  allowing suits for six specified \ntorts (including assault, battery, false imprisonment, and false arrest)\nto proceed against the United States  when the torts are committed by\n\u201cinvestigative or law enforcement o fficers.\u201d  While most courts hold \nthat the law enforcement proviso app lies only to the intentional-tort\nexception, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s a pproach is different in two key re-\nspects. First, the Eleventh Circuit alone holds that the proviso over-\nrides all exceptions in \u00a72680, incl uding the discretionary-function ex -\nception, meaning that intentional-to rt claims covered by the proviso \nautomatically proceed to the merits without further analysis of other \napplicable \u00a72680 exceptions.  Second, to compensate for this plaintiff-friendly approach, the Eleventh Circuit permits the government to as-sert a restrictive Supremacy Clause defense at the liability stage, al-\nlowing the government to escape liability when an officer\u2019s actions \nhave \u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and reasonably \u201ccom-\nply[ ] with the full range of federal law.\u201d  Denson v. United States , 574 \nF. 3d 1318, 1348. \nApplying its distinctive approach, the Eleventh Circuit held that the\nlaw enforcement proviso protected peti tioners\u2019 intentional-tort claims\nfrom both the intentional-tort and discretionary-function exceptions. \nThe court dismissed petitioners\u2019 ne gligence claims under the discre-\ntionary-function exception, reason ing that Special Agent Guerra en-\njoyed discretion in preparing for the warrant execution.  On the merits \nof the remaining intentional-tort claims, the court found the govern -\nment had a valid Supremacy Clause defense and granted summary\njudgment for the United States. \nHeld: \n1. The law enforcement proviso in \u00a72680(h) overrides only the inten -\ntional-tort exception in that subsection, not the discretionary-function \nexception or other exceptions throughout \u00a72680.  Pp. 6\u201311.\n(a) The text and structure of \u00a72680 demonstrate that the law en -\nforcement proviso applies only to th e intentional-tort exception.  The \nproviso appears within the same subs ection and sentence as the inten-\ntional-tort exception, reflecting th e established principle that statu -\ntory provisos generally modify only the provisions in which they ap-\npear.  Section 2680 contains 13 discrete exceptions.  Coupled with the \nlead-in clause, each exception forms a separate sentence and operates \nas a structurally distinct provisio n.  The proviso addresses the same\nsubject matter as subs ection (h)\u2014intentional torts\u2014while other excep-\ntions cover entirely different topics like lost mail, combat injuries, and quarantine impositions.  Further, the proviso\u2019s definitional sentence \nexpressly limits the definition of \u201ci nvestigative or law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d to \u201cthis subsection,\u201d ( i.e., subsection (h)), even  though the phrase \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  3 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nSyllabus \n\u201claw enforcement officer\u201d appears elsewhere in \u00a72680.  Congress\u2019s \nchoice to embed the proviso within subsection (h) rather than place it\nat the end of the full list of except ions, as it sometimes does with \nbroadly applicable provisos, further confirms the proviso\u2019s limited ap-\nplication to subsection (h) alone. Pp. 6\u201310.\n(b) Petitioners\u2019 arguments for broader application of the proviso \nare unpersuasive.  While the proviso mirrors the language of \u00a72680\u2019s lead-in clause by stating that \u00a71346(b) \u201cshall apply\u201d rather than \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d this textual similarity does not demonstrate that the pro-\nviso applies to all exceptions, whic h form discrete instructions that \nmay be understood completely withou t reference to other provisions. \nThe absence of limiting language in the proviso\u2019s first sentence does \nnot expand its scope beyond subsec tion (h), as Congress accomplished \nthat limitation through the provis o\u2019s placement within the same sen-\ntence as the intentional-tort except ion.  Legislative history suggesting \nCongress intended to address wrong-house raids broadly cannot dis -\nplace what the law\u2019s terms clearly direct, as legislative history is not the law and Members of Congress may have had multiple purposes in\nmind when crafting the proviso.  Pp. 10\u201311.\n2. The Supremacy Clause does no t afford the United States a de-\nfense in FTCA suits. The FTCA is the \u201csupreme\u201d federal law governing \nthe United States\u2019 tort liability and serves as the exclusive remedy for \ndamages claims arising from federal employees\u2019 official conduct.  The \nstatute generally makes the governme nt liable under state law on the \nsame terms as a private individual would be liable under the law of the place where the tortious conduct occurred.  Because the FTCA in-corporates state law as the liability standard, there is typically no con-\nflict between federal and state law for the Supremacy Clause to re -\nsolve. While federal law may sometimes displace state law in FTCA suits where a constitutional text or  federal statute supplies controlling \nliability rules, the Eleventh Circuit identified no such federal statute \nor constitutional provision displacing Georgia tort law in this case. The court\u2019s reliance on In re Neagle , 135 U. S. 1, is misplaced, as that \n19th-century decision involved a federal officer\u2019s immunity from state criminal prosecution for acts necessary and proper in discharging fed-eral duties, not the federal government\u2019s liability under a statute that\nexpressly subjects it to state tort law on the same terms as private \nparties.  Section 2674 specifies the defenses available to the govern -\nment, including judicial or legislative immunity and other defenses to\nwhich the United States is entitled , but these do not include the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s novel Supremacy Clause defense.  Pp. 12\u201317.\n3. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit  should consider whether subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s discretionary -function exception bars either the plaintiffs\u2019 \nnegligent- or intentional-tort claims\u2014undertaking that assessment \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n 4 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nwithout reference to the mistaken view that the law enforcement pro-\nviso applies to subsection (a).  The court must then ask of any surviving \nclaims whether, under Georgia state law, a \u201cprivate individual under \nlike circumstances\u201d would be liable for the acts and omissions the \nplaintiffs allege, subject to the defenses discussed in \u00a72674\u2014not a Su -\npremacy Clause defense.\nRemaining questions surrounding whether and under what circum -\nstances the discretionary-function ex ception may ever foreclose a suit \nlike this one lie well beyond the tw o questions the Court granted cer-\ntiorari to address, and their resolu tion would benefit from the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s careful reexamination of this case in the first instance. \nPp. 17\u201318. \nVacated and remanded. \nGORSUCH , J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

UNITED STATES, ET AL . \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \n[June 12, 2025]\n JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court. \nIf federal officers raid the wrong house, causing property \ndamage and assaulting innocent occupants, may the home -\nowners sue the government for damages?  The answer is \nnot as obvious as it might be. All agree that the Federal\nTort Claims Act permits some su its for wrong-house raids. \nBut the scope of the Act\u2019s permission is much less clear.\nThis case poses two questions about the Act\u2019s application: \none concerning the FTCA\u2019s sovereign-immunity waiver, \nand the other touching on the defenses the United States \nmay assert. \nI \nA \nIn the predawn hours of October 18, 2017, the Federal\nBureau of Investigation raided the wrong house in subur-ban Atlanta. Officers meant to execute search and arrest \nwarrants at a suspected gang hideout, 3741 Landau Lane.Instead, they stormed a quiet  family home, 3756 Denville \nTrace, occupied by Hilliard To i Cliatt, his partner Curtrina\nMartin, and her 7-year-old son G. W.  App. to Pet. for Cert. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 2 MARTIN v.

Id., at 7a\u20138a.  Fearing a home inva-\nsion, Mr. Cliatt and Ms. Martin hid in a bedroom closet. Id., \nat 8a. But the SWAT team soon found the couple\u2019s hiding \nspot, dragged Mr. Cliatt from the closet, \u201cthrew [him] down \non the floor,\u201d handcuffed him, and began \u201cbombarding [him] with questions.\u201d Id., at 79a. Meanwhile, another officer \ntrained his weapon on Ms. Martin, who was lying on thefloor half-naked, having fallen inside the closet.  Id., at 8a, \n89a. Only then did another officer stumble across some mail with the home\u2019s address on it and realize the team had \nthe wrong house. Id., at 8a. \nThe cause of the officers\u2019 mistake?  In preparation for the\nraid, Agent Guerra visited th e correct house to document\nits features and identify a staging area for the SWAT team. \nId., at 5a. But, he says, when he used his personal GPS to\nnavigate to 3741 Landau Lane on the day of the raid, it ledhim to 3756 Denville Trace.  631 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1287 \n(ND Ga. 2022).  No one could confirm as much later because \nAgent Guerra \u201cthrew . . . away\u201d his GPS device \u201cnot long after\u201d the raid.  Id., at 1288.

S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nAfter discovery and motions practice, the district court \nrejected each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and granted summary\njudgment to the government.  The Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed and, in doing so, relied on an understanding of the\nFTCA that no other circuit has adopted. To appreciate\nwhat sets the Eleventh Circuit apart and how its approach\naffected its analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, it helps tobegin by outlining how this suit would have proceeded else -\nwhere. \nThe FTCA allows those injured by federal employees to \nsue the United States for damages. The statute achieves \nthat end by waiving, in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b), the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s sovereign immunity for \u201ccertain torts committed \nby federal employees acting within the scope of their em-ployment.\u201d Brownback  v. King , 592 U. S. 209, 212 (2021) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the statute\u2019s waiver is subject to 13 exceptions that claw back the gov-ernment\u2019s immunity in certain circumstances. Set out in \n\u00a72680, most of these 13 exceptions are obviously inapplica -\nble to suits alleging police misconduct within the United States. But two in particular\u2014the discretionary-function \nexception and the intentional-tort exception\u2014sometimescome into play.\nIn a suit like this one, most courts begin by assessing the \nintentional-tort exception.  Lo cated in subsection (h) of\n\u00a72680, it prohibits claims alleging any of 11 enumerated \ntorts. But the exception is itself subject to a \u201claw enforce-\nment proviso.\u201d Millbrook v. United States , 569 U. S. 50, 55 \n(2013). That proviso countermands the exception with re-spect to six intentional torts (including assault, battery,\nfalse imprisonment, and false arrest) against \u201cinvestigative\nor law enforcement officers.\u201d \u00a72680(h). So if a plaintiff al-leges that a federal law enfo rcement officer committed one \nor more of those six torts, the proviso will ensure those \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n   4 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims survive an encounter wi th the intentional-tort ex-\nception. Id., at 55\u201356. \nNext, most courts turn to the discretionary-function ex-\nception. Housed in subsection (a) of \u00a72680, this exception\nbars \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d based on the exercise of an official\u2019s \u201cdis-\ncretionary function.\u201d Faced with that instruction, most \ncourts ask whether the exception precludes any of the plain-tiff \u2019s remaining tort claims.  And here, the answer is often \nless clear cut. The discretionary-function exception, this\nCourt has said, forbids suits challenging decisions that \u201cin-\nvolv[e] an element of judgment or choice\u201d of a \u201ckind that the \n. . . exception was designed to shield.\u201d  United States v. \nGaubert , 499 U. S. 315, 322\u2013323 (1991) (alteration in origi-\nnal; internal quotation marks omitted).  But several of our \nlower court colleagues report t hat they have \u201cstruggl[ed]\u201d to\ndiscern what this direction requires of them.  See, e.g., Xi v. \nHaugen , 68 F. 4th 824, 842 (CA3 2023) (Bibas, J., concur -\nring). So, for example, some lower courts have held that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not shield \u201ccareless\u201dor \u201cunconstitutional\u201d police conduct from judicial scrutiny, but others have taken a contrary view and read the excep-\ntion much more broadly. Id., at 843; Pet. for Cert. 28\u201334. \nFinally, if any of the plaintiff \u2019s claims survive the \ndiscretionary-function exception and thus fall within the\nFTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, courts turn to a third \nquestion: Is the government liable to the plaintiff on the \nmerits? When it comes to that question, the FTCA providesthat the government will usually be liable to the plaintiff if\na \u201cprivate individual under like circumstances,\u201d \u00a72674,\nwould be liable under \u201cthe law of the place\u201d where the gov-\nernment employee\u2019s wrongful \u201cact or omission occurred,\u201d \n\u00a71346(b)(1). Ordinarily, then, courts will find for the plain -\ntiff if he can demonstrate that federal officials committed a \ntort under applicable state law. See Brownback , 592 U. S., \nat 218. \nNow compare that approach to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nThat court begins much as others do, asking whether the \nlaw enforcement proviso permits a plaintiff \u2019s intentional-\ntort claims to advance past subsection (h)\u2019s intentional-tort \nexception. See Nguyen v. United States, 556 F. 3d 1244, \n1260 (2009).\nBut from there, the Eleventh Circuit proceeds quite dif-\nferently. Rather than asking whether the discretionary-function exception bars either the plaintiff \u2019s negligent-tort\nclaims or his intentional-tort claims, as most courts do, the \nEleventh Circuit applies that exception only to the plain-\ntiff \u2019s negligence claims.  The Eleventh Circuit does so be -\ncause, in its view, the law enforcement proviso does not justoverride the intentional-tort exce ption, it also overrides all \nthe other exceptions in \u00a72680, the discretionary-functionexception included.  Id., at 1257. Under that approach, any\nintentional-tort claim covered by the proviso automaticallyproceeds to the merits\u2014no matter what any other exceptionhas to say.\nTo compensate for its expansive and plaintiff-friendly\nreading of the proviso, the Eleventh Circuit then takes a restrictive and defendant-friendly view at the FTCA\u2019s lia-\nbility stage. In other courts, an FTCA plaintiff will usually\nprevail if he can show a \u201cprivate individual under like cir-\ncumstances,\u201d \u00a72674, would be liable under \u201cthe law of the\nplace\u201d where the government employee\u2019s wrongful \u201cact oromission occurred,\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1).  But in the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit, the government may assert a particular affirmative\ndefense under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause.  See \nDenson v. United States, 574 F. 3d 1318, 1347 (2009).  And \nthat defense, the Eleventh Circuit holds, defeats a claim whenever a law enforcement officer\u2019s contested actions bear \n\u201csome nexus with furthering fe deral policy and can reason-\nably be characterized as complying with the full range of \nfederal law.\u201d Id., at 1348; accord, Kordash v. United States, \n51 F. 4th 1289, 1293 (CA11 2022).\nApplying its unique approach to this case, the Eleventh \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nCircuit held that the law enforcement proviso spared the\nplaintiffs\u2019 intentional-tort clai ms from both the intentional-\ntort and the discretionary-functi on exceptions.  It dismissed \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 negligence cl aims under the discretionary-\nfunction exception because, in its view, Agent Guerra \u201cen-\njoyed discretion in how he prepared for the warrant execu-\ntion.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a\u201318a. And on the merits of \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 (remaining) intentional-tort claims, the court held that the government had a winning Supremacy Clause \ndefense. As a result, the Eleventh Circuit concluded, the \nUnited States was entitled to summary judgment.  Id., at \n18a\u201319a. \nWe agreed to take this case to examine the distinctive\nfeatures of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s approach\u2014namely (1)\nwhether the law enforcement pr oviso overrides not just the\nintentional-tort exception but also the discretionary-functionexception, and (2) whether the Supremacy Clause affords \nthe United States a defense in FTCA suits.  Pet. for Cert. 16, 25. 604 U. S. ___ (2025). \nII \nBegin with the law enforcement proviso.  Does it counter-\nmand only \u00a72680(h)\u2019s intentional-tort exception, as most circuits have concluded and the government argues?  Brief for Respondents 25; Xi, 68 F. 4th, at 842 (Bibas, J., concur-\nring) (collecting cases). Or does the proviso also override\nthe other exceptions in \u00a72680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception in subsection (a), as the Eleventh Circuit\nhas held and the plaintiffs contend?  Nguyen , 556 F. 3d, at \n1257; Brief for Petitioners 40. \nA \nTo answer that question, we turn to the relevant statu-\ntory text. Recall that \u00a71346(b) waives the federal govern-ment\u2019s sovereign immunity, subject to a list of 13 exceptions housed in \u00a72680.  Those exceptions are lettered (a) through \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n                 \n    \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n                 \n 7 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \n(n), with one letter unused.  Rather than setting the law \nenforcement proviso apart as a discrete provision at the end \nof that list, Congress folded it into subsection (h)\u2019s intentional-tort exception. Here\u2019s a sense of how the proviso (under -\nlined below) appears in context. \n\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of \nthis title shall not apply to\u2014 \n\u201c(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an\nemployee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or  regulation, whether or not\nsuch statute or regulation be valid, or based upon theexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n.  .  .  .  . \n\u201c(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest , malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de -\nceit, or interference with contract rights: Provided , That, \nwith regard to acts or omi ssions of invest igative or law \nenforcement officers of the United States Government, \nthe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of thistitle shall apply to any claim arising, on or after the dateof the enactment of this prov iso, out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arre st, abuse of process, or \nmalicious prosecution.  For the purpose of this subsec-\ntion, \u2018investigative or law enforcement officer\u2019 means \nany officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \n.  .  .  .  . \n\u201c(n) Any claim arising from the activities of a Fed-\neral land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or \na bank for cooperatives.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nThe proviso\u2019s placement supplies an immediate clue\nabout the scope of its application.  It appears in the same \nsubsection (and the same sentence) as the intentional-tort exception. Given that arrangement, an ordinary reader\nwould naturally presume that the proviso modifies only \nsubsection (h). An everyday example helps illustrate the \npoint. Suppose a wife leaves her husband a shopping list: \n\u201cPlease buy\u2014Apples.  Carrots. Steak: If there is a sale. Bread. Milk.\u201d The wife, we think, would be understandably \nfrustrated if her husband return ed home with only steak in\nhand because he could find nothing else discounted. Re-\nflecting that intuition about ordinary meaning, our cases\nrecognize that, absent reason to think otherwise, statutory\nprovisos generally modify only the provisions in which they \nsit. See McDonald v. United States, 279 U. S. 12, 20\u201321 \n(1929); Alaska v. United States, 545 U. S. 75, 106 (2005); \nA. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 154\u2013155 (2012) (Scalia\n& Garner).\nNothing about \u00a72680(h)\u2019s proviso gives us reason to think \nit works differently.  To the contrary, one textual clue after \nanother confirms that it follows the general rule.  Start with \nthe statute\u2019s grammatical structure.  Section 2680 contains \na lead-in clause (\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014\u201d) followed by a list \nof exceptions. In conjunction with the lead-in clause, each\nexception forms a stand-alone sentence ending with a pe-\nriod, operating as a \u201cdistinct,\u201d \u201cstructurally discrete\u201d provi-sion. Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , 543 \nU. S. 335, 344, and n. 4 (2005).  And, given that, it is hard\nto see how the law enforcement  proviso might apply beyond\nsubsection (h), modifying exceptions housed in separate\nsubsections (and separate sentences) elsewhere in \u00a72680.\nNotice, too, that subsection  (h) and its proviso work to -\ngether to address the same category of claims: intentional torts. Subsection (h)\u2019s intent ional-tort exception excludes \nfrom the FTCA\u2019s sovereign-immunity waiver claims for \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 9 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \ntorts like \u201cassault, battery, false imprisonment, [and] false\narrest.\u201d The proviso then undoes that assertion of sover -\neign immunity for some of th ose same torts when commit-\nted by \u201cinvestigative or law en forcement officers.\u201d  By con-\ntrast, the proviso does not so much as mention the issues\naddressed by \u00a72680\u2019s other exceptions, like claims for lost\nmail, combat injuries, or the imposition of quarantines.\n\u00a72680(b), (f ), (j).  That the proviso is \u201cconfined\u201d to the same\n\u201csubject-matter\u201d as subsection (h)\u2019s \u201cprincipal clause\u201d\nstands as more evidence yet that it \u201crefers only to the pro-\nvision to which it is attached.\u201d United States v. Morrow , \n266 U. S. 531, 535 (1925).\nThe proviso\u2019s second sentence is telling as well.  It defines \nthe phrase \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d In \ndoing so, the sentence tells us that the definition applies \nonly to \u201cthis subsection\u201d ( i.e., subsection (h)), even though\nthe phrase \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d also appears in subsec-tion (c)\u2019s exception for claims arising from tax and customs collection. \u00a72680(c), (h) . If Congress had wished the proviso \nto modify each of the exceptions in \u00a72680, it might have pro-vided a section-wide definition, rather than a limited defi-\nnition just for subsection (h).\nIf more evidence were needed, comparing this statute\nwith others would supply it.  Often, Congress drafts statu-tory lists followed by a proviso in a separate paragraph at\nthe end. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71383(a)(2)(F)(ii)(II), \n6928(f )(2). Sometimes, that placement can suggest that a \nproviso relates to all the prec eding subparts, not just the \nnearest one.  Scalia & Garner 156.  But here Congress chosea different course, folding the proviso into a single excep-tion, rather than appending it to the end of the full list of \nexceptions. And that choice, too, suggests this proviso ap-\nplies to subsection (h) alone.  See Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. \nTexas , 596 U. S. 685, 704 (2022). \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 10 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nSeeking to defend the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the\nproviso applies broadly across all of \u00a72680\u2019s exceptions, the\nplaintiffs offer a number of thoughtful arguments.  But, to \nour eyes, none can overcome the textual evidence we have\njust laid out.\nFirst, the plaintiffs ask us to focus on how the proviso\nmirrors \u00a72680\u2019s lead-in clause.  Brief for Petitioners 42. The lead-in clause, they observe, preserves the government\u2019s \nsovereign immunity by instructing that \u00a71346(b)\u2019s waiver\n\u201cshall not apply to \u201d claims covered by the exceptions.  \u00a72680\n(emphasis added). Meanwhile, the proviso countermandsthat direction by instructing that \u00a71346(b)\u2019s waiver \u201c shall \napply \u201d to certain claims. \u00a72680(h) (emphasis added).  Be-\ncause the language of the proviso mirrors the language ofthe lead-in clause, the plaintiffs submit, Congress must\nhave meant for the proviso to have the last word with re -\nspect to each of the FTCA\u2019s exceptions.  Id., at 42. That \nconclusion, however, does not follow from its premise.  Yes, \nthe proviso and lead-in clause contain similar language.And, yes, the proviso surely countermands the lead-in \nclause for purposes of subsection (h). But none of that \nmeans the proviso speaks to ot her exceptions that work to-\ngether with the lead-in language to form discrete instruc -\ntions that \u201cmay be understood completely without readingany further.\u201d Jama , 543 U. S., at 344. \nSecond, the plaintiffs remind us that the proviso\u2019s second, \ndefinitional sentence applies to \u201cthis subsection,\u201d but the \nproviso\u2019s first, substantive part contains no such limiting language. Brief for Petitioners 42\u201343 (quoting \u00a72680(h)). And that difference, the plaintiffs say, suggests that the \nfirst, substantive part applies throughout \u00a72680.  Id., at 42\u2013 \n43. Again, however, we do not see it.  Congress had no need \nto include similar limiting language in the first part of the \nproviso to confine its application to subsection (h).  Con -\ngress accomplished just that by placing the proviso\u2019s first \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n 11 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \npart in the same sentence as the intentional-tort exception. \nMeanwhile, in the proviso\u2019s second sentence, Congress ar-\nguably needed to confine the definition of \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d to \u201cthis  subsection\u201d to ensure that \nthe phrase \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d carries a different \nmeaning when it appears in subsection (c).\nThird, the plaintiffs resort to legislative history.  They\npoint to a committee report discussing how Congress en-acted the proviso in response to two wrong-house raids \nmuch like their own.  Id., at 8\u201310, 44; see S. Rep. No. 93\u2013 \n588, p. 3 (1973).  And, the plaintiffs argue, unless the pro-viso is given broad effect across \u00a72680, it will not fulfill Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose of ensuring that wrong-house-raid cases may proceed.  But this argument stumbles, too.  Few pieces\nof legislation pursue any single \u201cpurpos[e] at all costs.\u201d \nAmerican Express Co.  v. Italian Colors Restaurant , 570 \nU. S. 228, 234 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd Members of Congress may well have had more thanone purpose in mind when adding the proviso to the FTCA.\nPerhaps some thought amending subsection (h) alone and \nleaving others untouched would strike a suitable balance \nbetween immunity and liability. Perhaps others concluded\nthere was no need to apply the proviso more broadly be-cause no other exception would shield the government from \nliability for wrong-house raids. Whatever the reason, no amount of guesswork about the purposes behind legislation\ncan displace what the law\u2019s terms clearly direct.  \u201c[L]egisla-\ntive history is not the law.\u201d Epic Systems Corp.  v. Lewis , \n584 U. S. 497, 523 (2018). \nIII \nThat takes us to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s second outlier po-\nsition and the second question presented.  May the United States defeat an FTCA suit by invoking the Supremacy Clause and showing that a federal officer\u2019s acts had \u201csome \nnexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and \u201ccompli[ed] with \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nthe full range of federal law\u201d? App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because the govern-\nment now concedes that it enjoys no such defense, the Court appointed Christopher Mills as amicus  to represent the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s views.  604 U. S. ___ (2025).  He has ably discharged his responsibilities.  But in the end, we find the \ngovernment\u2019s concession co mmendable and correct: The \nFTCA does not permit the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy\nClause defense. \nThe Supremacy Clause supplies a rule of decision when \nfederal and state laws conflict.  It provides that the \u201cCon-\nstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any\nstate to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d  Art. VI, cl. 2.  So, \nfor example, when a regulated party cannot comply with\nboth federal and state directives, the Supremacy Clause \ntells us the state law must yield.  See, e.g., Virginia Ura-\nnium, Inc. v. Warren , 587 U. S. 761, 767 (2019) (opinion of \nG\nORSUCH , J.). \nThe FTCA is the \u201csupreme\u201d federal law addressing the \nUnited States\u2019 liability for torts committed by its agents.  It supplies the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for damages claims arising out of federal employees\u2019 official conduct.  See Hui v. Cas-\ntaneda , 599 U. S. 799, 806 (2010).  And, as we have seen, \nthe government will usually be liable if a \u201cprivate individ-\nual under like circumstances,\u201d \u00a72674, \u201cwould be liable to \nthe claimant in accordance with the law of the place where \nthe act or omission occurred,\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1).  Accordingly, a \nplaintiff may generally prevail in an FTCA suit by demon-strating that \u201cthe State in which the alleged misconduct oc-\ncurred would permit a cause of action for that misconduct \nto go forward.\u201d  Carlson v. Green , 446 U. S. 14, 23 (1980). \nBecause the FTCA\u2019s liability rule incorporates state law, \nin most cases there is no conflict for the Supremacy Clause \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nto resolve. Take this case. Georgia law supplies the rele-\nvant \u201claw of the place\u201d where the officers\u2019 tortious conduct\noccurred. \u00a71346(b)(1). And Georgia law would permit ahomeowner to sue a private person for damages if that per-\nson intentionally or negligently raided his house and as-\nsaulted him.  See App. 10\u201313 (citing Hendricks v. Southern \nBell Tel. & Tel. Co. , 193 Ga. App. 264, 264\u2013265, 387 S. E.\n2d 593, 594\u2013595 (1989), for assault and battery and Lyttle \nv. United States , 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1301 (MD Ga. 2012), \nfor negligence). So when th e FTCA, the relevant federal \nlaw in this field, instructs co urts to apply those same state\nrules to decide whether the United States is liable to the plaintiffs, there is no discord between the two. \nTo be sure, it is possible (though rare) for federal and\nstate law to conflict in an FTCA suit.  So, for example, in Hess v.

In re Neagle  involved an affair, a homicide, and a \nhabeas petition.  In 1883, Sarah Althea Hill claimed to be the wife of U. S. Senator William Sharon and sought a \nshare of his fortune in acrimonious California divorce pro-\nceedings. Sharon admitted an a ffair but insisted that Hill \nhad forged the pair\u2019s handwritten marriage contract. Hill \nhired David Terry to represent her.  A former Chief Justice \nof the California Supreme Court, Terry had resigned that post after killing (another) U. S. Senator in a duel.  As the \nlitigation wore on, lawyer and client married.\nEventually, the dispute be tween Hill and Sharon wound \nup before U. S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field while he was riding circuit.  Terry  and Justice Field were no \nstrangers, having served together on the California Su-preme Court. Even so, Justice Field issued a devastating\nruling against Hill.  As he announced his decision, Hill leapt from her seat, denounced the Justice as \u201cbought,\u201d and had \nto be carried from the courtr oom.  Joining the fracas, Terry\npunched a marshal and brandished a bowie knife.  Even af-ter the couple spent time in jail for contempt, they contin-\nued to issue threats against Justice Field.\n1 \nThose events found their way into the U. S. Reports this \nway.

L. Rev. 654 Recovering the Lost Meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s \u201cDiscretionary Function Exception\u201d Volume 138 Issue 2 December 2024 See full issue Download See Footnotes Since 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act1 (FTCA) has waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for damages claims brought against the United States for the tortious conduct of its employees.2 This waiver has allowed those wronged by a federal officer to seek recovery through claims predicated on the common law tort of the state in which the wrong occurred.3 But that waiver is subject to a litany of exceptions.4 One is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02680(a), which retains the government\u2019s immunity for any claim based on an employee\u2019s performance or failure to perform \u201ca discretionary function or duty\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d5 The lower courts have interpreted this \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d capaciously, rendering it remarkably broad and applicable to innumerable acts.6 In large part because of this, when the government has invoked the exception at the motion to dismiss stage, it has succeeded in dismissing nearly seventy-five percent of claims.7 But notable disagreements persist concerning the exception\u2019s bounds. One such disagreement has resulted in a split amongst the courts of appeals. It concerns the interplay between the discretionary function exception and the U.S. Constitution. Does the exception immunize the government from tort claims that also constitute constitutional violations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even though the Constitution cannot form the basis of a plaintiff\u2019s FTCA tort claim?8 Or does the Constitution place bounds on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that the exception can immunize? For instance, imagine a case in which a U.S. Park Police Officer arrested a woman for organizing a large prayer service on National Park grounds.9 Her arrest was not legally authorized and thus could constitute false arrest under the common law. If she brought an FTCA claim against the United States alleging false arrest, the government would, in the ordinary course, move to dismiss on grounds that the discretionary function exception applies.10 But could she successfully oppose that motion by arguing that the arrest plausibly violated her First Amendment rights, so the exception cannot apply? That question has real ramifications. Many claims that could be pleaded as constitutional violations could also be pleaded as violations of state tort law.11 For instance, many Fourth Amendment violations overlap with torts such as battery and invasion of privacy.12 So plaintiffs alleging official federal misconduct can pursue two damages claims: (1) an FTCA claim against the federal government for the tort and (2) a claim against the officer in their personal capacity for the constitutional violation.13 But today, plaintiffs will have trouble succeeding on the latter claim\u00a0\u2014\u00a0commonly referred to as a Bivens action for the 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,14 which implied a private right to damages relief for constitutional violations.15 Over the last few decades, the Court has appreciably cut back the availability of Bivens remedies.16 Judicially created causes of action, in its eyes, impermissibly blur the constitutional lines between legislative and judicial power.17 With Bivens largely gutted, the FTCA provides virtually the only path to damages relief for individuals harmed by a federal officer\u2019s unconstitutional conduct. And whether that path is a feasible one turns on whether the discretionary function exception applies to unconstitutional conduct. For almost fifty years, nearly every court of appeals to consider the issue reached the same conclusion. The government could not invoke the discretionary function exception in response to an FTCA claim if the tort alleged also constituted a constitutional violation.18 These courts generally reasoned that \u201c[i]t is, of course, a tautology that a federal official cannot have discretion to behave unconstitutionally.\u201d19 This proposition was considered so \u201celementary\u201d that these courts adopted this stance with little justification or interpretation of the FTCA itself.20 But in 2019, some circuits began challenging this entrenched conclusion. With Judge Easterbrook writing for a majority, the Seventh Circuit declared: \u201c[T]he theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d21 The Eleventh Circuit followed, describing the dominant view as writing in an \u201cextra-textual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion\u2019\u201d into the statute.22 The Seventh and Eleventh Circuits largely rooted their arguments in the text. Section 2680(a) applies \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused,\u201d so the statute is \u201cunambiguous and categorical\u201d in its scope, they argued.23 It does not \u201ccarve[] out certain behavior,\u201d even unconstitutional behavior, from the exception.24 This makes sense, they said, because \u201cCongress did not create the FTCA to address constitutional violations at all but, rather, to address violations of state tort law.\u201d25 And Congress made that explicit when it amended the FTCA in 1988, clarifying its inapplicability to claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d26 That amendment, both courts argued, proved that FTCA claims must be considered \u201cwithout regard to constitutional theories.\u201d27 The resulting split has spurred myriad commentators to side with the majority view, but largely with defenses that double down on that view\u2019s original axiom\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that any other reading of the exception is simply incompatible with the Constitution.28 This Note offers a different tack that places the majority view on firmer footing. It argues that Congress transplanted the common law term \u201cdiscretion,\u201d which governed officer suits at common law, into the discretionary function exception. And it demonstrates how that exception, when properly interpreted against this common law backdrop, retains the government\u2019s immunity only for \u201cconstitutionally permissible\u201d discretionary functions.29 Part I explains the doctrine of \u201cdiscretion\u201d that governed officer suits at common law. This Part argues the predominant view at common law was that the Constitution placed boundaries on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that could be conferred on officers. Part II discusses the upshot for interpreting the discretionary function exception. And it shows how interpreting \u201cdiscretion\u201d as referring to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion\u201d fits within the larger mechanics of the FTCA\u2019s scheme and Supreme Court doctrine implementing it. Part III concludes by discussing the implications of this interpretation for how plaintiffs looking to vindicate constitutional rights through tort suits under the FTCA should plead their FTCA claims. I.\u00a0\u00a0The Discretionary Function Exception\u2019s Common Law Backdrop When the FTCA was enacted in 1946, it did not emerge ex nihilo. Rather, it built upon a long tradition of official accountability rooted in tort law that prevailed since the early republic. Prior to the FTCA\u2019s passage, individuals could not receive damages directly from the United States for the tortious conduct of its officers.30 Sovereign immunity barred any suit for money damages brought directly against the United States.31 But it did not bar suit against the officers who committed the wrongs.32 Throughout the nineteenth century, individuals wronged by official misconduct sought redress against individual officers by suing them in tort.33 And if the officer was found liable, the officer could in turn seek indemnification from the government in the form of a private bill from Congress.34 In the era prior to the Civil War, about sixty percent of officers who sought indemnity received it.35 But by the early twentieth century, this practice had become arduous and distracting for Congress.36 And so in 1946, Congress enacted the FTCA to replace the antiquated scheme. Given this history, one cannot understand the modern regime without first grasping its common law foundations. This Part begins by examining the common law roots of \u201cdiscretion\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a doctrinal fixture in officer suits at common law that dictated the extent to which an individual executive official could be held liable for misconduct. It then draws upon examples of individual officer suits at common law to explain how the common law viewed the Constitution as imposing constraints on discretion. A.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDiscretion\u201d at Common Law As early as Marbury v. Madison,37 the Supreme Court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0apparently motivated by separation of powers concerns\u00a0\u2014\u00a0articulated the principle that courts should not \u201cenquire\u201d into how officers \u201cperform duties in which they have\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretion.\u201d38 By the mid-nineteenth century, courts captured this immunity principle through a distinction between \u201cministerial\u201d and \u201cdiscretionary\u201d functions.39 Officials had discretionary rather than ministerial duties when the law gave them the authority to use their own judgment to decide how to best carry out their obligations.40 Because this latitude of judgment was similar to that granted to judges,41 discretionary authority for executive officials was sometimes referred to as \u201cquasi-judicial.\u201d42 Courts used this distinction to determine the individual damages liability of an officer for carrying out his duties improperly.43 To be sure, the line between ministerial and discretionary functions was not always clear. Courts did not always agree about whether a particular duty constituted a ministerial or a discretionary one.44 For example, when the FTCA was enacted, state courts were divided over whether a warden\u2019s duty to preserve the health and safety of jails and their occupants was ministerial or discretionary in nature.45 And as the distinction developed throughout the early twentieth century, some criticized it as being largely indeterminate and unhelpful for deciding the proper scope of an officer\u2019s liability.46 Professor Louis Jaffe described it as \u201ca way of stating rather than arriving at the result,\u201d merely a \u201cconvenient device for extending the area of nonliability without making the reasons explicit.\u201d47 And Dean William Prosser\u2019s 1941 Handbook of the Law of Torts labeled it a \u201crather unworkable distinction.\u201d48 But regardless of the academic disdain for the distinction, it remained alive and well in the courts. Through the early twentieth century, courts consistently employed the distinction to determine whether an officer could be held liable in damages for his misdeeds.49 B.\u00a0\u00a0The Boundaries of Common Law Discretion Nonetheless, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was not a blank permission slip. As this Part describes, even if a court found that an officer was delegated \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority, it could still find the officer liable for his misdeeds. This is because a separate principle generally embraced at common law stated that \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers were shielded from liability only if they did not \u201cact wholly outside of their jurisdiction or official authority.\u201d50 As Professor James Pfander helpfully describes it, this \u201cdiscretion\u201d was a \u201czone.\u201d51 As long as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers operated within that zone, they \u201cwere free to exercise their best judgment without judicial oversight.\u201d52 But if a court determined that an officer \u201cact[ed] beyond his jurisdiction,\u201d as the Supreme Court put it in the 1849 case Wilkes v. Dinsman,53 that court would treat the officer \u201cas not acting in the capacity of an officer at all\u201d54 but rather as merely a private citizen, stripped of any official defenses from suit.55 How would a court determine when an officer had stepped outside these boundaries? One cannot and should not pretend that courts were always consistent. But the common law tended to embrace the principle that an officer could exceed these bounds by contravening the Constitution.56 That is, \u201cdiscretion,\u201d no matter how broadly conferred, could not dissolve constitutional limits. This Part explores the two types of paradigmatic common law cases that illustrate this principle. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Tortious Conduct.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0When an individual was harmed by official misconduct at common law, they \u201ccould normally seek redress by invoking forms of action available at common law and in equity that included suits against governmental officials under ordinary tort law.\u201d57 The claim was not pled as a constitutional violation. But the Constitution still played a role in these suits if the federal officer attempted to respond by raising defenses that were available to him by virtue of his federal official status.58 For example, an officer might claim in defense that he was acting in his official capacity pursuant to a lawful order.59 But if his actions nonetheless violated the Constitution, the plaintiff could argue in reply that the officer\u2019s claimed authority to act violated the Constitution.60 That the officer relied on an official order in good faith was no defense; \u201cwhat mattered was legality.\u201d61 As the Supreme Court explained in the officer suit case of Mitchell v. Harmony,62 a person who executes an \u201corder to do an illegal act,\u201d such as one that violates the Constitution, has still committed an illegal act.63 In these contexts, the constitutional violation would effectively \u201cstrip\u201d the officer \u201cof his official character,\u201d rendering him liable in damages for his misconduct like any ordinary citizen.64 Many officers held liable under this scheme successfully turned to Congress, ultimately shifting the liability of judgment onto the public fisc.65 These principles would have done the same work in the context of officers who violated the Constitution acting pursuant to \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority.66 After all, an individual stripped of his official character would not have been able to invoke any official justification for his behavior, including that he was acting with latitude of discretion conferred to him under federal law. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Enforcing Unconstitutional Statutes.\u00a0\u2014 Another type of officer suit that commonly recurred at common law illustrates how the common law would have treated \u201cdiscretion\u201d as being constrained by constitutional limits. At common law, plaintiffs could bring damages suits against officers who carried out duties pursuant to unconstitutional statutes.67 And when they did so, even officers acting in a discretionary capacity were denied the ability to invoke the unconstitutional statute in defense to such claims.68 In such contexts, as the Supreme Court expounded in 1949, \u201cthe power has been conferred in form but the grant is lacking in substance because of its constitutional invalidity.\u201d69 Scores of precedents from state courts70 and the federal Supreme Court71 invoked this rule. It was rooted in a basic principle: if the government enacted a statute that was unconstitutional, the government exceeded its lawful powers, and the statute would not shield the officer who acted as the government\u2019s agent from suit.72 This practice accorded with the long-accepted premise that an unconstitutional statute is no law at all.73 The same principles would have applied had a statute conferred discretion on an official to act, and the official did so in a manner that contravened the Constitution. After all, a legislature that lacks the authority to directly authorize its agents to carry out unconstitutional acts likewise lacks the authority to do so indirectly. Consequently, a statute authorizing officers discretion to carry out certain acts could not have shielded those who committed unconstitutional acts in the exercise of that discretion from liability simply because the statute granted the officers latitude of judgment.74 The 1880 case of Gross v. Rice75 is illustrative of the point. Gross sued Rice, his prison warden, for damages for false imprisonment when Rice kept him imprisoned beyond his initial sentence.76 Rice responded by arguing that his actions were authorized by a statute allowing wardens to hold prisoners beyond their sentence by the amount of time they had spent in solitary confinement for contravening prison rules.77 The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine nonetheless found Rice liable because it held that the statute was unconstitutional.78 It empowered Rice to deprive Gross of his liberty \u201cwithout any new accusation, trial and sentence,\u201d thereby violating his right to due process of law.79 The court conceded that \u201cthe punishment of refractory convicts is a matter within the discretion of the warden.\u201d80 But as the court put it, \u201c[i]t does not follow that because a warden may inflict some punishment, he may inflict any.\u201d81 Rather, his \u201cdiscretion\u201d was subject to \u201climits,\u201d of which the Constitution was one.82 The court in Rice bolstered its reasoning by considering what would have occurred had the warden held Gross beyond his sentence without a statute authorizing him to do so.83 The court had little difficulty concluding the result would have been the same. The warden still would have \u201cdeprive[d] the prisoner of his liberty without any process of law and without any legal excuse or justification whatever.\u201d84 Because legislatures do not have the power to transform acts that would be unconstitutional into constitutional ones, the statute clearly could not shield the warden from liability by merely granting him \u201cdiscretion.\u201d Neither Rice nor its reasoning was an anomaly. As Professor Edwin Borchard summarized the existing law in 1924, \u201cthe Supreme Court has never hesitated to enjoin or otherwise control the instrument or agent of the State acting under an unconstitutional statute or, of course, acting unconstitutionally in the execution of a valid statute.\u201d85 By the end of the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court began developing immunity doctrines that broke with the common law\u2019s strict liability regime, as many scholars have documented.86 But even then, the Court did not abandon the fundamental principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d does not transcend constitutional limits, as exemplified by the two patterns of cases described above.87 This is why, for instance, the Supreme Court has reiterated that \u201c[o]f course, a prosecutor\u2019s discretion is \u2018subject to constitutional constraints.\u2019\u201d88 So when the FTCA was enacted, it codified \u201cdiscretion\u201d against a well-developed background principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d referred only to the \u201cdiscretion contemplated by law.\u201d89 II.\u00a0\u00a0The FTCA Upshot Whether the discretionary function exception applies to tortious conduct that is also a constitutional violation is one of many contested questions about the exception\u2019s meaning. The FTCA does not include a definition of the phrase \u201cdiscretionary function or duty.\u201d90 As a result, courts have long struggled to determine the exception\u2019s bounds.91 The Supreme Court\u2019s test for determining whether the exception applies offers little additional guidance.92 Under that test, if the conduct \u201cinvolves an element of judgment or choice\u201d \u201cgrounded in social, economic, and political policy\u201d considerations, the exception applies.93 But, as one treatise puts it, \u201cthe exact boundaries of the exception remain unclear.\u201d94 This Part argues that the common law helps to illuminate those boundaries, particularly those drawn by the Constitution. The common law often plays a \u201cgap-filling role in statutory interpretation.\u201d95 As Justice Thomas once explained, the Supreme Court \u201cpresume[s] that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law.\u201d96 So when a statute uses a \u201cterm[] of art\u201d that took on a particular meaning at common law,97 the Court often relies on the common law as \u201can authoritative external source of [the statute\u2019s] meaning,\u201d just as it would a dictionary or a semantic canon.98 The FTCA is particularly well-suited to this mode of construction. As the Supreme Court contended in 1962, \u201c[i]t is evident that the Act was not patterned to operate with complete independence from\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the common law.\u201d99\u00a0 Instead, the FTCA was devised to \u201cbuild upon the legal relationships formulated and characterized by the States.\u201d100 A.\u00a0\u00a0Incorporating Common Law \u201cDiscretion\u201d into the FTCA \u201cDiscretion,\u201d as understood and applied at common law, would have been a familiar concept to the FTCA-enacting Congress.101 In the de\u00adcades preceding the FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress evaluated thousands of private claims for indemnification based on tort judgments rendered against officers under the common law.102 When Congress enacted the FTCA to replace this scheme, its primary aim was to get the legislature out of the business of considering each damages claim individually.103 It was not to entirely restructure the substance of these suits\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something the Supreme Court has recognized since the FTCA\u2019s infancy.104 This is apparent from the way that claims under the Act piggyback off existing state tort regimes. As one treatise puts it, \u201cthe Act does not create new causes of action\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in the sense of inventing new types of torts.\u201d105 Rather, it simply waives sovereign immunity for tort claims available to plaintiffs suing a \u201cprivate person\u201d in the state where the act or omission occurred.106 The Supreme Court has described the Act as \u201cmerely substitut[ing] the District Courts for Congress as the agency to determine the validity and amount of the claims\u201d that were previously considered by private bills.107 Because the FTCA was written against this rich common law backdrop and \u201cdiscretion\u201d had a recognizable meaning at common law, early commentators concluded that Congress must have intentionally invoked the phrase to codify the common law doctrine of nonliability for officers exercising acts requiring discretion.108 The Supreme Court recognized the common law doctrine\u2019s relevance when it considered the exception for the first time in Dalehite v. United States.109 But the analogy did not catch hold. Struggling to define the exception\u2019s vague contours in practice, the Supreme Court began to craft various tests to liquidate the exception\u2019s meaning.110 The result is that modern discretionary function jurisprudence is rooted in a judicially constructed test that is largely disconnected from the original meaning of the statutory text.111 It is possible that the Court opted not to adopt the analogy this Note is propounding because many scholars and courts at the time were critical of the ministerial/discretionary model, in large part because they believed the dichotomy between the two was muddled.112 But those criticisms, however accurate they may be, should not be a barrier to using the analogy in this context. After all, the relevant question is whether Congress incorporated the common law definition of \u201cdiscretion\u201d into the FTCA at all, not whether the specific contours of the ministerial/discretionary distinction were well defined. And there is strong evidence Congress intended the analogy. As the Supreme Court noted in Dalehite, Congress added the exception later on in the drafting process \u201cas a clarifying amendment\u201d to ensure that courts adjudicating FTCA claims would continue to employ the common law doctrine governing liability for discretionary officials.113 The House Committee on the Judiciary was advised that, even without such clarification, \u201c[i]t [wa]s not probable that the courts would extend a [T]ort [C]laims [A]ct into the realm of the validity of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretionary administrative action,\u201d as then\u2013Assistant Attorney General Shea explained in a House hearing.114 Instead, the FTCA\u2019s drafters thought such cases would have been \u201cexempted\u201d already by \u201cjudicial construction.\u201d115 The bill was modified only to \u201cmake [this] explicit.\u201d116 To be sure, the entire purpose of the discretionary function exception is to demarcate a category of cases in which the FTCA\u2019s general waiver of the government\u2019s immunity from suit \u201cshall not apply.\u201d117 By contrast, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was used to determine an officer\u2019s immunity from suit. And at common law, the scope of an officer\u2019s immunity was not coterminous with the government\u2019s. When an individual officer exceeded his authority by offending the Constitution, he could be sued even though the government could not.118 Indeed, officer suits in these cases were in effect a means of getting around the sovereign immunity of the state.119 Sovereign immunity would not bar such a claim against the officer precisely because the officer\u2019s actions in such a situation were not \u201cattributed to the sovereign.\u201d120 Consequently, interpreting a waiver of sovereign immunity via an analogy to officer immunity may seem inapt. But the analogy has a strong doctrinal basis. First, recall that Congress enacted the FTCA to contend with the relationship between sovereign immunity and officer liability at common law, as this Part has described. Because the FTCA was designed to replace the pre-FTCA regime\u00a0\u2014\u00a0formally transferring the liability of government officers to the government itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it makes sense that Congress would draw on the mechanics of officer liability in crafting this regime. Second, consider that the rationales underlying official immunity are largely the same as those justifying sovereign immunity in the modern era. Courts and commentators have long rationalized official immunity as necessary to address two distinct but interrelated concerns. The first is that without immunity, public officers would be \u201cunduly hampered\u201d in the execution of their duties by the threat of liability,121 thus impeding the \u201ceffective administration of public affairs.\u201d122 The second is that without immunity, courts would be forced to scrutinize the propriety of policymaking decisions, thereby threatening separation of powers.123 Though sovereign immunity was originally introduced in the United States as a vestige of the English common law axiom \u201cthe King can do no wrong,\u201d124 it is sustained today on largely similar public policy grounds.125 Courts have long rationalized that without sovereign immunity, the government\u2019s focus and resources would be unduly tied up in litigation, jeopardizing its ability to effectively govern.126 Likewise, scholars have argued that sovereign immunity prevents the kind of judicial second-guessing of a coordinate branch\u2019s functions that undermines separation of powers.127 In light of these parallels, it makes sense to draw upon the common law principles of officer immunity to interpret a statute governing the government\u2019s immunity from suit. B.\u00a0\u00a0Operationalizing the FTCA\u2019s Common Law Backdrop If we accept the premise that the FTCA\u2019s text points us toward the common law of officer immunity as a window into the meaning of the discretionary function exception, where does that take us?128 The history articulated in Part I suggests we should reject Judge Easterbrook\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act.\u201d129 After all, if \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was understood to refer only to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d130 one cannot disregard \u201cconstitutional theories\u201d in determining the scope of the exception.131 Doing so would contravene the very text of the statute. Text-based arguments to the contrary fail upon closer inspection. First, courts have emphasized that the exception applies to all acts of discretion \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d132 And because an officer who acts unconstitutionally has abused their discretion, the argument goes, the exception applies to such conduct.133 Indeed, even the federal government has taken this position recently, embracing the litigating position that \u201capplication of the exception does not turn on whether the official has exercised the discretion in a permissible manner.\u201d134 It has marshaled some dicta from the Supreme Court in support of this view.135 But unconstitutional conduct does not \u201cabuse\u201d discretion; it exceeds discretion. As Part I describes, acts that violated the Constitution at common law were treated as acts taken outside the realm of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority. Acts that abuse discretion, by contrast, are merely errors in judgment, even if \u201cmonumental\u201d and of \u201cinexcusable proportions.\u201d136 This is so because discretion vests officers with the power to use their authority \u201caccording to [their] own view of what is necessary and proper,\u201d creating a zone that insulates officers who get that calculation wrong.137 Officers step outside that zone only by engaging in conduct that removes their discretion wholesale\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as acts that violate the Constitution. The second and third contentions can be grouped together because they rely on the same category error. The FTCA applies only to state tort claims for which a \u201cprivate person\u201d could be liable.138 That \u201c[t]he Constitution governs the conduct of public officials, not private ones\u201d seems to be in tension with this premise.139 Indeed, in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Meyer,140 the Supreme Court explicitly held that a \u201cconstitutional tort claim is not \u2018cognizable\u2019\u201d under the FTCA, relying largely on the \u201cprivate person\u201d language.141 Moreover, in 1988 Congress passed the Westfall Act, amending the FTCA to ensure it would not cover claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d142 But both the \u201cprivate person\u201d proviso and the Westfall Act limitation clarify the type of claim that can be brought under the FTCA. They say nothing about the types of arguments one can raise to defeat the government\u2019s invocation of the discretionary function exception in response to their claims.143 A tort claim \u201cbrought for\u201d tortious conduct is not \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution\u201d just because the tortious conduct also could have been pled as a constitutional violation.144 Rather, a tort claim is brought for a violation of rights secured by common law. In this context, then, the Constitution enters into the equation to serve not as a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim but only as a response to the government\u2019s attempt to rely on the exception to defeat that claim. III.\u00a0\u00a0Pleading the \u201cConstitutionally Permissible\u201d Interpretation If the Constitution is relevant to whether the discretionary function exception applies, what must a plaintiff plead to prevent the exception from defeating her claim?145 The federal government has recently taken the position that a constitutional violation might foreclose the exception, but only if the plaintiff could show that the officer violated \u201ca specific, clearly established constitutional directive.\u201d146 The government derives this rule from the doctrine of qualified immunity, the modern standard of officer immunity applicable to Bivens claims brought against federal officers and claims brought against state officers for violations of federal law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.147 Under that doctrine, an officer cannot be held liable for violating the Constitution unless the constitutional violation was \u201cclearly established.\u201d148 Constitutional violations are clearly established only when \u201cexisting precedent\u201d has placed the \u201cconstitutional question beyond debate.\u201d149 The upshot of that standard is that courts can decide an officer did violate the Constitution yet still not grant the plaintiff relief if the violation was not already articulated by existing case law at the time the officer acted.150 Ironically, the government justifies importing that standard into the discretionary function exception by arguing that \u201cthe common-law doctrine of official immunity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0formed the backdrop to the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception.\u201d151 Courts would be wrong to embrace the clearly established law standard in this context. Plenty of scholars152 and even some Justices153 have explained how the modern doctrine of qualified immunity masquerades as rooted in the common law of our early republic while being entirely inconsistent with the actual immunity regimes that predominated at common law. And as this Note has shown, officers performing \u201cdiscretionary functions\u201d at common law did not get judicial grace for tortious wrongs that violated the Constitution whenever the constitutional right was not already clearly established by law. Instead, the common law treated an officer who committed a constitutional violation despite having \u201cdiscretion\u201d as having acted beyond the limits of his discretion and thus relinquished his official status and defenses the moment he committed the unconstitutional act. That the officer acted in good faith, believing his actions were lawful, was no defense.154 A clearly established law requirement would also be inconsistent with how courts apply the discretionary function exception to conduct that violates federal statutes, regulations, or policies. Under modern Supreme Court precedent, \u201cif a \u2018federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action\u2019\u201d for an officer to adhere to, the exception is inapplicable.155 This makes sense. In such instances, the officer \u201chas no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d156 In other words, they lack discretion to act. But courts don\u2019t apply a clearly established law requirement when deciding whether a statute contains a specific directive that constrains an officer\u2019s authority. In fact, they are frequently forced to interpret federal statutes, policies, and regulations anew when contending with claims that the officer\u2019s conduct violated them.157 And they don\u2019t withhold relief if there is no \u201cexisting precedent\u201d from other courts considering the question and thus placing the issue \u201cbeyond debate\u201d like the clearly established law standard requires.158 Instead, they grant relief if they determine that the official conduct was prescribed by statute or regulation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether they are the first court to reach that conclusion or not. The same standard should apply equally to FTCA claims involving constitutional violations. To be sure, plaintiffs should not be able to render the exception inapplicable by merely pleading that the officer\u2019s conduct implicated abstract constitutional principles. After all, that would transform the exception from a \u201csteel\u201d shield to a \u201cpaper\u201d one, as one district court put it159\u00a0\u2014\u00a0taking an exception that has been rendered overly broad by courts and turning it into one that will be overly narrow. But existing doctrines can guard against that. The discretionary function exception is jurisdictional, so the burden is on plaintiffs to prove that it does not apply.160 This most commonly occurs at the motion to dismiss stage, when the government invokes the exception to argue that the court does not have jurisdiction over the complaint because the complained of conduct implicates a discretionary function or duty.161 To survive this motion, plaintiffs will need to be able to make a colorable claim that is \u201cplausible on its face\u201d that a constitutional violation occurred.162 Courts evaluating this argument will frequently look to existing case law and constitutional principles to determine whether such a claim is plausible.163 At least one court has argued that it \u201cwould make no sense whatsoever\u201d for the FTCA to require courts to engage in such a detailed analysis from the outset to determine whether the United States is subject to suit.164 But courts already do just that when determining whether the exception applies in any context.165 They routinely leaf through National Park Service manuals and site management plans, for instance, when plaintiffs bring tort claims for accidents that occurred at national parks, looking to determine whether Park Service policies vested park officials with broad discretion.166 Plus, district courts have long been tasked with assessing the merits of alleged constitutional violations at the pleadings stage in other contexts, such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 suits, when the government moves to dismiss by arguing qualified immunity applies.167 Properly interpreted, the FTCA demands no different. Conclusion Today, Bivens is a largely nonexistent form of relief. But the FTCA does not need to be interpreted in a way that nullifies its remedial potential as well. Congress meant something specific when it wrote the discretionary function exception into the Act. One just needs to know where to look to discern its meaning. The Supreme Court has long instructed that the FTCA was \u201cdesigned to build upon\u201d the common law that developed in the context of tort suits for officer wrongs.168 That common law backdrop serves as a critical guide to understanding the meaning of this enigmatic exception. Once one understands that \u201cdiscretion,\u201d properly constructed in light of its common law meaning, refers to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d the exact boundaries of the exception become clearer. Though the discretionary function exception has been interpreted to retain the government\u2019s immunity in a breathtaking swath of cases, the proper interpretation suggests its reach should not extend to a potentially large category of cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0those in which plaintiffs can successfully plead that a constitutional violation preserves the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear their FTCA case.

Rev. 654 Recovering the Lost Meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s \u201cDiscretionary Function Exception\u201d Volume 138 Issue 2 December 2024 See full issue Download See Footnotes Since 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act1 (FTCA) has waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for damages claims brought against the United States for the tortious conduct of its employees.2 This waiver has allowed those wronged by a federal officer to seek recovery through claims predicated on the common law tort of the state in which the wrong occurred.3 But that waiver is subject to a litany of exceptions.4 One is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02680(a), which retains the government\u2019s immunity for any claim based on an employee\u2019s performance or failure to perform \u201ca discretionary function or duty\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d5 The lower courts have interpreted this \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d capaciously, rendering it remarkably broad and applicable to innumerable acts.6 In large part because of this, when the government has invoked the exception at the motion to dismiss stage, it has succeeded in dismissing nearly seventy-five percent of claims.7 But notable disagreements persist concerning the exception\u2019s bounds. One such disagreement has resulted in a split amongst the courts of appeals. It concerns the interplay between the discretionary function exception and the U.S. Constitution. Does the exception immunize the government from tort claims that also constitute constitutional violations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even though the Constitution cannot form the basis of a plaintiff\u2019s FTCA tort claim?8 Or does the Constitution place bounds on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that the exception can immunize? For instance, imagine a case in which a U.S. Park Police Officer arrested a woman for organizing a large prayer service on National Park grounds.9 Her arrest was not legally authorized and thus could constitute false arrest under the common law. If she brought an FTCA claim against the United States alleging false arrest, the government would, in the ordinary course, move to dismiss on grounds that the discretionary function exception applies.10 But could she successfully oppose that motion by arguing that the arrest plausibly violated her First Amendment rights, so the exception cannot apply? That question has real ramifications. Many claims that could be pleaded as constitutional violations could also be pleaded as violations of state tort law.11 For instance, many Fourth Amendment violations overlap with torts such as battery and invasion of privacy.12 So plaintiffs alleging official federal misconduct can pursue two damages claims: (1) an FTCA claim against the federal government for the tort and (2) a claim against the officer in their personal capacity for the constitutional violation.13 But today, plaintiffs will have trouble succeeding on the latter claim\u00a0\u2014\u00a0commonly referred to as a Bivens action for the 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,14 which implied a private right to damages relief for constitutional violations.15 Over the last few decades, the Court has appreciably cut back the availability of Bivens remedies.16 Judicially created causes of action, in its eyes, impermissibly blur the constitutional lines between legislative and judicial power.17 With Bivens largely gutted, the FTCA provides virtually the only path to damages relief for individuals harmed by a federal officer\u2019s unconstitutional conduct. And whether that path is a feasible one turns on whether the discretionary function exception applies to unconstitutional conduct. For almost fifty years, nearly every court of appeals to consider the issue reached the same conclusion. The government could not invoke the discretionary function exception in response to an FTCA claim if the tort alleged also constituted a constitutional violation.18 These courts generally reasoned that \u201c[i]t is, of course, a tautology that a federal official cannot have discretion to behave unconstitutionally.\u201d19 This proposition was considered so \u201celementary\u201d that these courts adopted this stance with little justification or interpretation of the FTCA itself.20 But in 2019, some circuits began challenging this entrenched conclusion. With Judge Easterbrook writing for a majority, the Seventh Circuit declared: \u201c[T]he theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d21 The Eleventh Circuit followed, describing the dominant view as writing in an \u201cextra-textual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion\u2019\u201d into the statute.22 The Seventh and Eleventh Circuits largely rooted their arguments in the text. Section 2680(a) applies \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused,\u201d so the statute is \u201cunambiguous and categorical\u201d in its scope, they argued.23 It does not \u201ccarve[] out certain behavior,\u201d even unconstitutional behavior, from the exception.24 This makes sense, they said, because \u201cCongress did not create the FTCA to address constitutional violations at all but, rather, to address violations of state tort law.\u201d25 And Congress made that explicit when it amended the FTCA in 1988, clarifying its inapplicability to claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d26 That amendment, both courts argued, proved that FTCA claims must be considered \u201cwithout regard to constitutional theories.\u201d27 The resulting split has spurred myriad commentators to side with the majority view, but largely with defenses that double down on that view\u2019s original axiom\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that any other reading of the exception is simply incompatible with the Constitution.28 This Note offers a different tack that places the majority view on firmer footing. It argues that Congress transplanted the common law term \u201cdiscretion,\u201d which governed officer suits at common law, into the discretionary function exception. And it demonstrates how that exception, when properly interpreted against this common law backdrop, retains the government\u2019s immunity only for \u201cconstitutionally permissible\u201d discretionary functions.29 Part I explains the doctrine of \u201cdiscretion\u201d that governed officer suits at common law. This Part argues the predominant view at common law was that the Constitution placed boundaries on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that could be conferred on officers. Part II discusses the upshot for interpreting the discretionary function exception. And it shows how interpreting \u201cdiscretion\u201d as referring to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion\u201d fits within the larger mechanics of the FTCA\u2019s scheme and Supreme Court doctrine implementing it. Part III concludes by discussing the implications of this interpretation for how plaintiffs looking to vindicate constitutional rights through tort suits under the FTCA should plead their FTCA claims. I.\u00a0\u00a0The Discretionary Function Exception\u2019s Common Law Backdrop When the FTCA was enacted in 1946, it did not emerge ex nihilo. Rather, it built upon a long tradition of official accountability rooted in tort law that prevailed since the early republic. Prior to the FTCA\u2019s passage, individuals could not receive damages directly from the United States for the tortious conduct of its officers.30 Sovereign immunity barred any suit for money damages brought directly against the United States.31 But it did not bar suit against the officers who committed the wrongs.32 Throughout the nineteenth century, individuals wronged by official misconduct sought redress against individual officers by suing them in tort.33 And if the officer was found liable, the officer could in turn seek indemnification from the government in the form of a private bill from Congress.34 In the era prior to the Civil War, about sixty percent of officers who sought indemnity received it.35 But by the early twentieth century, this practice had become arduous and distracting for Congress.36 And so in 1946, Congress enacted the FTCA to replace the antiquated scheme. Given this history, one cannot understand the modern regime without first grasping its common law foundations. This Part begins by examining the common law roots of \u201cdiscretion\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a doctrinal fixture in officer suits at common law that dictated the extent to which an individual executive official could be held liable for misconduct. It then draws upon examples of individual officer suits at common law to explain how the common law viewed the Constitution as imposing constraints on discretion. A.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDiscretion\u201d at Common Law As early as Marbury v. Madison,37 the Supreme Court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0apparently motivated by separation of powers concerns\u00a0\u2014\u00a0articulated the principle that courts should not \u201cenquire\u201d into how officers \u201cperform duties in which they have\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretion.\u201d38 By the mid-nineteenth century, courts captured this immunity principle through a distinction between \u201cministerial\u201d and \u201cdiscretionary\u201d functions.39 Officials had discretionary rather than ministerial duties when the law gave them the authority to use their own judgment to decide how to best carry out their obligations.40 Because this latitude of judgment was similar to that granted to judges,41 discretionary authority for executive officials was sometimes referred to as \u201cquasi-judicial.\u201d42 Courts used this distinction to determine the individual damages liability of an officer for carrying out his duties improperly.43 To be sure, the line between ministerial and discretionary functions was not always clear. Courts did not always agree about whether a particular duty constituted a ministerial or a discretionary one.44 For example, when the FTCA was enacted, state courts were divided over whether a warden\u2019s duty to preserve the health and safety of jails and their occupants was ministerial or discretionary in nature.45 And as the distinction developed throughout the early twentieth century, some criticized it as being largely indeterminate and unhelpful for deciding the proper scope of an officer\u2019s liability.46 Professor Louis Jaffe described it as \u201ca way of stating rather than arriving at the result,\u201d merely a \u201cconvenient device for extending the area of nonliability without making the reasons explicit.\u201d47 And Dean William Prosser\u2019s 1941 Handbook of the Law of Torts labeled it a \u201crather unworkable distinction.\u201d48 But regardless of the academic disdain for the distinction, it remained alive and well in the courts. Through the early twentieth century, courts consistently employed the distinction to determine whether an officer could be held liable in damages for his misdeeds.49 B.\u00a0\u00a0The Boundaries of Common Law Discretion Nonetheless, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was not a blank permission slip. As this Part describes, even if a court found that an officer was delegated \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority, it could still find the officer liable for his misdeeds. This is because a separate principle generally embraced at common law stated that \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers were shielded from liability only if they did not \u201cact wholly outside of their jurisdiction or official authority.\u201d50 As Professor James Pfander helpfully describes it, this \u201cdiscretion\u201d was a \u201czone.\u201d51 As long as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers operated within that zone, they \u201cwere free to exercise their best judgment without judicial oversight.\u201d52 But if a court determined that an officer \u201cact[ed] beyond his jurisdiction,\u201d as the Supreme Court put it in the 1849 case Wilkes v. Dinsman,53 that court would treat the officer \u201cas not acting in the capacity of an officer at all\u201d54 but rather as merely a private citizen, stripped of any official defenses from suit.55 How would a court determine when an officer had stepped outside these boundaries? One cannot and should not pretend that courts were always consistent. But the common law tended to embrace the principle that an officer could exceed these bounds by contravening the Constitution.56 That is, \u201cdiscretion,\u201d no matter how broadly conferred, could not dissolve constitutional limits. This Part explores the two types of paradigmatic common law cases that illustrate this principle. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Tortious Conduct.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0When an individual was harmed by official misconduct at common law, they \u201ccould normally seek redress by invoking forms of action available at common law and in equity that included suits against governmental officials under ordinary tort law.\u201d57 The claim was not pled as a constitutional violation. But the Constitution still played a role in these suits if the federal officer attempted to respond by raising defenses that were available to him by virtue of his federal official status.58 For example, an officer might claim in defense that he was acting in his official capacity pursuant to a lawful order.59 But if his actions nonetheless violated the Constitution, the plaintiff could argue in reply that the officer\u2019s claimed authority to act violated the Constitution.60 That the officer relied on an official order in good faith was no defense; \u201cwhat mattered was legality.\u201d61 As the Supreme Court explained in the officer suit case of Mitchell v. Harmony,62 a person who executes an \u201corder to do an illegal act,\u201d such as one that violates the Constitution, has still committed an illegal act.63 In these contexts, the constitutional violation would effectively \u201cstrip\u201d the officer \u201cof his official character,\u201d rendering him liable in damages for his misconduct like any ordinary citizen.64 Many officers held liable under this scheme successfully turned to Congress, ultimately shifting the liability of judgment onto the public fisc.65 These principles would have done the same work in the context of officers who violated the Constitution acting pursuant to \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority.66 After all, an individual stripped of his official character would not have been able to invoke any official justification for his behavior, including that he was acting with latitude of discretion conferred to him under federal law. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Enforcing Unconstitutional Statutes.\u00a0\u2014 Another type of officer suit that commonly recurred at common law illustrates how the common law would have treated \u201cdiscretion\u201d as being constrained by constitutional limits. At common law, plaintiffs could bring damages suits against officers who carried out duties pursuant to unconstitutional statutes.67 And when they did so, even officers acting in a discretionary capacity were denied the ability to invoke the unconstitutional statute in defense to such claims.68 In such contexts, as the Supreme Court expounded in 1949, \u201cthe power has been conferred in form but the grant is lacking in substance because of its constitutional invalidity.\u201d69 Scores of precedents from state courts70 and the federal Supreme Court71 invoked this rule. It was rooted in a basic principle: if the government enacted a statute that was unconstitutional, the government exceeded its lawful powers, and the statute would not shield the officer who acted as the government\u2019s agent from suit.72 This practice accorded with the long-accepted premise that an unconstitutional statute is no law at all.73 The same principles would have applied had a statute conferred discretion on an official to act, and the official did so in a manner that contravened the Constitution. After all, a legislature that lacks the authority to directly authorize its agents to carry out unconstitutional acts likewise lacks the authority to do so indirectly. Consequently, a statute authorizing officers discretion to carry out certain acts could not have shielded those who committed unconstitutional acts in the exercise of that discretion from liability simply because the statute granted the officers latitude of judgment.74 The 1880 case of Gross v. Rice75 is illustrative of the point. Gross sued Rice, his prison warden, for damages for false imprisonment when Rice kept him imprisoned beyond his initial sentence.76 Rice responded by arguing that his actions were authorized by a statute allowing wardens to hold prisoners beyond their sentence by the amount of time they had spent in solitary confinement for contravening prison rules.77 The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine nonetheless found Rice liable because it held that the statute was unconstitutional.78 It empowered Rice to deprive Gross of his liberty \u201cwithout any new accusation, trial and sentence,\u201d thereby violating his right to due process of law.79 The court conceded that \u201cthe punishment of refractory convicts is a matter within the discretion of the warden.\u201d80 But as the court put it, \u201c[i]t does not follow that because a warden may inflict some punishment, he may inflict any.\u201d81 Rather, his \u201cdiscretion\u201d was subject to \u201climits,\u201d of which the Constitution was one.82 The court in Rice bolstered its reasoning by considering what would have occurred had the warden held Gross beyond his sentence without a statute authorizing him to do so.83 The court had little difficulty concluding the result would have been the same. The warden still would have \u201cdeprive[d] the prisoner of his liberty without any process of law and without any legal excuse or justification whatever.\u201d84 Because legislatures do not have the power to transform acts that would be unconstitutional into constitutional ones, the statute clearly could not shield the warden from liability by merely granting him \u201cdiscretion.\u201d Neither Rice nor its reasoning was an anomaly. As Professor Edwin Borchard summarized the existing law in 1924, \u201cthe Supreme Court has never hesitated to enjoin or otherwise control the instrument or agent of the State acting under an unconstitutional statute or, of course, acting unconstitutionally in the execution of a valid statute.\u201d85 By the end of the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court began developing immunity doctrines that broke with the common law\u2019s strict liability regime, as many scholars have documented.86 But even then, the Court did not abandon the fundamental principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d does not transcend constitutional limits, as exemplified by the two patterns of cases described above.87 This is why, for instance, the Supreme Court has reiterated that \u201c[o]f course, a prosecutor\u2019s discretion is \u2018subject to constitutional constraints.\u2019\u201d88 So when the FTCA was enacted, it codified \u201cdiscretion\u201d against a well-developed background principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d referred only to the \u201cdiscretion contemplated by law.\u201d89 II.\u00a0\u00a0The FTCA Upshot Whether the discretionary function exception applies to tortious conduct that is also a constitutional violation is one of many contested questions about the exception\u2019s meaning. The FTCA does not include a definition of the phrase \u201cdiscretionary function or duty.\u201d90 As a result, courts have long struggled to determine the exception\u2019s bounds.91 The Supreme Court\u2019s test for determining whether the exception applies offers little additional guidance.92 Under that test, if the conduct \u201cinvolves an element of judgment or choice\u201d \u201cgrounded in social, economic, and political policy\u201d considerations, the exception applies.93 But, as one treatise puts it, \u201cthe exact boundaries of the exception remain unclear.\u201d94 This Part argues that the common law helps to illuminate those boundaries, particularly those drawn by the Constitution. The common law often plays a \u201cgap-filling role in statutory interpretation.\u201d95 As Justice Thomas once explained, the Supreme Court \u201cpresume[s] that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law.\u201d96 So when a statute uses a \u201cterm[] of art\u201d that took on a particular meaning at common law,97 the Court often relies on the common law as \u201can authoritative external source of [the statute\u2019s] meaning,\u201d just as it would a dictionary or a semantic canon.98 The FTCA is particularly well-suited to this mode of construction. As the Supreme Court contended in 1962, \u201c[i]t is evident that the Act was not patterned to operate with complete independence from\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the common law.\u201d99\u00a0 Instead, the FTCA was devised to \u201cbuild upon the legal relationships formulated and characterized by the States.\u201d100 A.\u00a0\u00a0Incorporating Common Law \u201cDiscretion\u201d into the FTCA \u201cDiscretion,\u201d as understood and applied at common law, would have been a familiar concept to the FTCA-enacting Congress.101 In the de\u00adcades preceding the FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress evaluated thousands of private claims for indemnification based on tort judgments rendered against officers under the common law.102 When Congress enacted the FTCA to replace this scheme, its primary aim was to get the legislature out of the business of considering each damages claim individually.103 It was not to entirely restructure the substance of these suits\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something the Supreme Court has recognized since the FTCA\u2019s infancy.104 This is apparent from the way that claims under the Act piggyback off existing state tort regimes. As one treatise puts it, \u201cthe Act does not create new causes of action\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in the sense of inventing new types of torts.\u201d105 Rather, it simply waives sovereign immunity for tort claims available to plaintiffs suing a \u201cprivate person\u201d in the state where the act or omission occurred.106 The Supreme Court has described the Act as \u201cmerely substitut[ing] the District Courts for Congress as the agency to determine the validity and amount of the claims\u201d that were previously considered by private bills.107 Because the FTCA was written against this rich common law backdrop and \u201cdiscretion\u201d had a recognizable meaning at common law, early commentators concluded that Congress must have intentionally invoked the phrase to codify the common law doctrine of nonliability for officers exercising acts requiring discretion.108 The Supreme Court recognized the common law doctrine\u2019s relevance when it considered the exception for the first time in Dalehite v. United States.109 But the analogy did not catch hold. Struggling to define the exception\u2019s vague contours in practice, the Supreme Court began to craft various tests to liquidate the exception\u2019s meaning.110 The result is that modern discretionary function jurisprudence is rooted in a judicially constructed test that is largely disconnected from the original meaning of the statutory text.111 It is possible that the Court opted not to adopt the analogy this Note is propounding because many scholars and courts at the time were critical of the ministerial/discretionary model, in large part because they believed the dichotomy between the two was muddled.112 But those criticisms, however accurate they may be, should not be a barrier to using the analogy in this context. After all, the relevant question is whether Congress incorporated the common law definition of \u201cdiscretion\u201d into the FTCA at all, not whether the specific contours of the ministerial/discretionary distinction were well defined. And there is strong evidence Congress intended the analogy. As the Supreme Court noted in Dalehite, Congress added the exception later on in the drafting process \u201cas a clarifying amendment\u201d to ensure that courts adjudicating FTCA claims would continue to employ the common law doctrine governing liability for discretionary officials.113 The House Committee on the Judiciary was advised that, even without such clarification, \u201c[i]t [wa]s not probable that the courts would extend a [T]ort [C]laims [A]ct into the realm of the validity of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretionary administrative action,\u201d as then\u2013Assistant Attorney General Shea explained in a House hearing.114 Instead, the FTCA\u2019s drafters thought such cases would have been \u201cexempted\u201d already by \u201cjudicial construction.\u201d115 The bill was modified only to \u201cmake [this] explicit.\u201d116 To be sure, the entire purpose of the discretionary function exception is to demarcate a category of cases in which the FTCA\u2019s general waiver of the government\u2019s immunity from suit \u201cshall not apply.\u201d117 By contrast, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was used to determine an officer\u2019s immunity from suit. And at common law, the scope of an officer\u2019s immunity was not coterminous with the government\u2019s. When an individual officer exceeded his authority by offending the Constitution, he could be sued even though the government could not.118 Indeed, officer suits in these cases were in effect a means of getting around the sovereign immunity of the state.119 Sovereign immunity would not bar such a claim against the officer precisely because the officer\u2019s actions in such a situation were not \u201cattributed to the sovereign.\u201d120 Consequently, interpreting a waiver of sovereign immunity via an analogy to officer immunity may seem inapt. But the analogy has a strong doctrinal basis. First, recall that Congress enacted the FTCA to contend with the relationship between sovereign immunity and officer liability at common law, as this Part has described. Because the FTCA was designed to replace the pre-FTCA regime\u00a0\u2014\u00a0formally transferring the liability of government officers to the government itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it makes sense that Congress would draw on the mechanics of officer liability in crafting this regime. Second, consider that the rationales underlying official immunity are largely the same as those justifying sovereign immunity in the modern era. Courts and commentators have long rationalized official immunity as necessary to address two distinct but interrelated concerns. The first is that without immunity, public officers would be \u201cunduly hampered\u201d in the execution of their duties by the threat of liability,121 thus impeding the \u201ceffective administration of public affairs.\u201d122 The second is that without immunity, courts would be forced to scrutinize the propriety of policymaking decisions, thereby threatening separation of powers.123 Though sovereign immunity was originally introduced in the United States as a vestige of the English common law axiom \u201cthe King can do no wrong,\u201d124 it is sustained today on largely similar public policy grounds.125 Courts have long rationalized that without sovereign immunity, the government\u2019s focus and resources would be unduly tied up in litigation, jeopardizing its ability to effectively govern.126 Likewise, scholars have argued that sovereign immunity prevents the kind of judicial second-guessing of a coordinate branch\u2019s functions that undermines separation of powers.127 In light of these parallels, it makes sense to draw upon the common law principles of officer immunity to interpret a statute governing the government\u2019s immunity from suit. B.\u00a0\u00a0Operationalizing the FTCA\u2019s Common Law Backdrop If we accept the premise that the FTCA\u2019s text points us toward the common law of officer immunity as a window into the meaning of the discretionary function exception, where does that take us?128 The history articulated in Part I suggests we should reject Judge Easterbrook\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act.\u201d129 After all, if \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was understood to refer only to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d130 one cannot disregard \u201cconstitutional theories\u201d in determining the scope of the exception.131 Doing so would contravene the very text of the statute. Text-based arguments to the contrary fail upon closer inspection. First, courts have emphasized that the exception applies to all acts of discretion \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d132 And because an officer who acts unconstitutionally has abused their discretion, the argument goes, the exception applies to such conduct.133 Indeed, even the federal government has taken this position recently, embracing the litigating position that \u201capplication of the exception does not turn on whether the official has exercised the discretion in a permissible manner.\u201d134 It has marshaled some dicta from the Supreme Court in support of this view.135 But unconstitutional conduct does not \u201cabuse\u201d discretion; it exceeds discretion. As Part I describes, acts that violated the Constitution at common law were treated as acts taken outside the realm of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority. Acts that abuse discretion, by contrast, are merely errors in judgment, even if \u201cmonumental\u201d and of \u201cinexcusable proportions.\u201d136 This is so because discretion vests officers with the power to use their authority \u201caccording to [their] own view of what is necessary and proper,\u201d creating a zone that insulates officers who get that calculation wrong.137 Officers step outside that zone only by engaging in conduct that removes their discretion wholesale\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as acts that violate the Constitution. The second and third contentions can be grouped together because they rely on the same category error. The FTCA applies only to state tort claims for which a \u201cprivate person\u201d could be liable.138 That \u201c[t]he Constitution governs the conduct of public officials, not private ones\u201d seems to be in tension with this premise.139 Indeed, in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Meyer,140 the Supreme Court explicitly held that a \u201cconstitutional tort claim is not \u2018cognizable\u2019\u201d under the FTCA, relying largely on the \u201cprivate person\u201d language.141 Moreover, in 1988 Congress passed the Westfall Act, amending the FTCA to ensure it would not cover claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d142 But both the \u201cprivate person\u201d proviso and the Westfall Act limitation clarify the type of claim that can be brought under the FTCA. They say nothing about the types of arguments one can raise to defeat the government\u2019s invocation of the discretionary function exception in response to their claims.143 A tort claim \u201cbrought for\u201d tortious conduct is not \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution\u201d just because the tortious conduct also could have been pled as a constitutional violation.144 Rather, a tort claim is brought for a violation of rights secured by common law. In this context, then, the Constitution enters into the equation to serve not as a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim but only as a response to the government\u2019s attempt to rely on the exception to defeat that claim. III.\u00a0\u00a0Pleading the \u201cConstitutionally Permissible\u201d Interpretation If the Constitution is relevant to whether the discretionary function exception applies, what must a plaintiff plead to prevent the exception from defeating her claim?145 The federal government has recently taken the position that a constitutional violation might foreclose the exception, but only if the plaintiff could show that the officer violated \u201ca specific, clearly established constitutional directive.\u201d146 The government derives this rule from the doctrine of qualified immunity, the modern standard of officer immunity applicable to Bivens claims brought against federal officers and claims brought against state officers for violations of federal law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.147 Under that doctrine, an officer cannot be held liable for violating the Constitution unless the constitutional violation was \u201cclearly established.\u201d148 Constitutional violations are clearly established only when \u201cexisting precedent\u201d has placed the \u201cconstitutional question beyond debate.\u201d149 The upshot of that standard is that courts can decide an officer did violate the Constitution yet still not grant the plaintiff relief if the violation was not already articulated by existing case law at the time the officer acted.150 Ironically, the government justifies importing that standard into the discretionary function exception by arguing that \u201cthe common-law doctrine of official immunity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0formed the backdrop to the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception.\u201d151 Courts would be wrong to embrace the clearly established law standard in this context. Plenty of scholars152 and even some Justices153 have explained how the modern doctrine of qualified immunity masquerades as rooted in the common law of our early republic while being entirely inconsistent with the actual immunity regimes that predominated at common law. And as this Note has shown, officers performing \u201cdiscretionary functions\u201d at common law did not get judicial grace for tortious wrongs that violated the Constitution whenever the constitutional right was not already clearly established by law. Instead, the common law treated an officer who committed a constitutional violation despite having \u201cdiscretion\u201d as having acted beyond the limits of his discretion and thus relinquished his official status and defenses the moment he committed the unconstitutional act. That the officer acted in good faith, believing his actions were lawful, was no defense.154 A clearly established law requirement would also be inconsistent with how courts apply the discretionary function exception to conduct that violates federal statutes, regulations, or policies. Under modern Supreme Court precedent, \u201cif a \u2018federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action\u2019\u201d for an officer to adhere to, the exception is inapplicable.155 This makes sense. In such instances, the officer \u201chas no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d156 In other words, they lack discretion to act. But courts don\u2019t apply a clearly established law requirement when deciding whether a statute contains a specific directive that constrains an officer\u2019s authority. In fact, they are frequently forced to interpret federal statutes, policies, and regulations anew when contending with claims that the officer\u2019s conduct violated them.157 And they don\u2019t withhold relief if there is no \u201cexisting precedent\u201d from other courts considering the question and thus placing the issue \u201cbeyond debate\u201d like the clearly established law standard requires.158 Instead, they grant relief if they determine that the official conduct was prescribed by statute or regulation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether they are the first court to reach that conclusion or not. The same standard should apply equally to FTCA claims involving constitutional violations. To be sure, plaintiffs should not be able to render the exception inapplicable by merely pleading that the officer\u2019s conduct implicated abstract constitutional principles. After all, that would transform the exception from a \u201csteel\u201d shield to a \u201cpaper\u201d one, as one district court put it159\u00a0\u2014\u00a0taking an exception that has been rendered overly broad by courts and turning it into one that will be overly narrow. But existing doctrines can guard against that. The discretionary function exception is jurisdictional, so the burden is on plaintiffs to prove that it does not apply.160 This most commonly occurs at the motion to dismiss stage, when the government invokes the exception to argue that the court does not have jurisdiction over the complaint because the complained of conduct implicates a discretionary function or duty.161 To survive this motion, plaintiffs will need to be able to make a colorable claim that is \u201cplausible on its face\u201d that a constitutional violation occurred.162 Courts evaluating this argument will frequently look to existing case law and constitutional principles to determine whether such a claim is plausible.163 At least one court has argued that it \u201cwould make no sense whatsoever\u201d for the FTCA to require courts to engage in such a detailed analysis from the outset to determine whether the United States is subject to suit.164 But courts already do just that when determining whether the exception applies in any context.165 They routinely leaf through National Park Service manuals and site management plans, for instance, when plaintiffs bring tort claims for accidents that occurred at national parks, looking to determine whether Park Service policies vested park officials with broad discretion.166 Plus, district courts have long been tasked with assessing the merits of alleged constitutional violations at the pleadings stage in other contexts, such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 suits, when the government moves to dismiss by arguing qualified immunity applies.167 Properly interpreted, the FTCA demands no different. Conclusion Today, Bivens is a largely nonexistent form of relief. But the FTCA does not need to be interpreted in a way that nullifies its remedial potential as well. Congress meant something specific when it wrote the discretionary function exception into the Act. One just needs to know where to look to discern its meaning. The Supreme Court has long instructed that the FTCA was \u201cdesigned to build upon\u201d the common law that developed in the context of tort suits for officer wrongs.168 That common law backdrop serves as a critical guide to understanding the meaning of this enigmatic exception. Once one understands that \u201cdiscretion,\u201d properly constructed in light of its common law meaning, refers to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d the exact boundaries of the exception become clearer. Though the discretionary function exception has been interpreted to retain the government\u2019s immunity in a breathtaking swath of cases, the proper interpretation suggests its reach should not extend to a potentially large category of cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0those in which plaintiffs can successfully plead that a constitutional violation preserves the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear their FTCA case.

W., A MINOR , ET AL . v. UNITED STATES ET AL . \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 24\u2013362. Argued April 29, 2025\u2014Decided June 12, 2025 \nOn October 18, 2017, the FBI raided the wrong house in suburban At -\nlanta.  Officers meant to execute search and arrest warrants at a sus-\npected gang hideout at 3741 Landau Lane but instead stormed 3756 \nDenville Trace, a quiet family home  occupied by petitioners Hilliard\nToi Cliatt, his partner Curtrina Martin, and her 7-year-old son.  A six-\nmember SWAT team breached the front door, detonated a flash-bang\ngrenade, and assaulted the innocent occupants before realizing their mistake. The cause of the error was Special Agent Guerra\u2019s reliance \non a personal GPS device, combined with the team\u2019s failure to notice the street sign for \u201cDenville Trace\u201d  and the house number visible on \nthe mailbox.  Left with personal in juries and property damage, peti-\ntioners sued the United States und er the Federal Tort Claims Act \n(FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72671 et seq. , seeking damages re sulting from the\nofficers\u2019 alleged negligent and intentional actions during the raid.  The \ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the government.  The \nEleventh Circuit affirmed, applyi ng a unique approach to FTCA \nclaims.  \nThe FTCA waives the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity \nfrom suit as to certain torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment .  But that waiver is subject to\nstatutory exceptions, including two relevant to a law enforcement mis-\nconduct case like this one. The firs t is the intentional-tort exception \nin \u00a72680(h), which bars claims against the government for 11 enumer -\nated intentional torts.  The second is the discretionary-function excep-\ntion in \u00a72680(a), which bars claims against the government that are \nbased on an official\u2019s exercise of  discretionary functions.  Section \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n 2 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \n2680(h) also contains a \u201claw enforcement proviso\u201d which counter -\nmands the intentional-tort exception,  allowing suits for six specified \ntorts (including assault, battery, false imprisonment, and false arrest)\nto proceed against the United States  when the torts are committed by\n\u201cinvestigative or law enforcement o fficers.\u201d  While most courts hold \nthat the law enforcement proviso app lies only to the intentional-tort\nexception, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s a pproach is different in two key re-\nspects. First, the Eleventh Circuit alone holds that the proviso over-\nrides all exceptions in \u00a72680, incl uding the discretionary-function ex -\nception, meaning that intentional-to rt claims covered by the proviso \nautomatically proceed to the merits without further analysis of other \napplicable \u00a72680 exceptions.  Second, to compensate for this plaintiff-friendly approach, the Eleventh Circuit permits the government to as-sert a restrictive Supremacy Clause defense at the liability stage, al-\nlowing the government to escape liability when an officer\u2019s actions \nhave \u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and reasonably \u201ccom-\nply[ ] with the full range of federal law.\u201d  Denson v. United States , 574 \nF. 3d 1318, 1348. \nApplying its distinctive approach, the Eleventh Circuit held that the\nlaw enforcement proviso protected peti tioners\u2019 intentional-tort claims\nfrom both the intentional-tort and discretionary-function exceptions. \nThe court dismissed petitioners\u2019 ne gligence claims under the discre-\ntionary-function exception, reason ing that Special Agent Guerra en-\njoyed discretion in preparing for the warrant execution.  On the merits \nof the remaining intentional-tort claims, the court found the govern -\nment had a valid Supremacy Clause defense and granted summary\njudgment for the United States. \nHeld: \n1. The law enforcement proviso in \u00a72680(h) overrides only the inten -\ntional-tort exception in that subsection, not the discretionary-function \nexception or other exceptions throughout \u00a72680.  Pp. 6\u201311.\n(a) The text and structure of \u00a72680 demonstrate that the law en -\nforcement proviso applies only to th e intentional-tort exception.  The \nproviso appears within the same subs ection and sentence as the inten-\ntional-tort exception, reflecting th e established principle that statu -\ntory provisos generally modify only the provisions in which they ap-\npear.  Section 2680 contains 13 discrete exceptions.  Coupled with the \nlead-in clause, each exception forms a separate sentence and operates \nas a structurally distinct provisio n.  The proviso addresses the same\nsubject matter as subs ection (h)\u2014intentional torts\u2014while other excep-\ntions cover entirely different topics like lost mail, combat injuries, and quarantine impositions.  Further, the proviso\u2019s definitional sentence \nexpressly limits the definition of \u201ci nvestigative or law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d to \u201cthis subsection,\u201d ( i.e., subsection (h)), even  though the phrase \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  3 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nSyllabus \n\u201claw enforcement officer\u201d appears elsewhere in \u00a72680.  Congress\u2019s \nchoice to embed the proviso within subsection (h) rather than place it\nat the end of the full list of except ions, as it sometimes does with \nbroadly applicable provisos, further confirms the proviso\u2019s limited ap-\nplication to subsection (h) alone. Pp. 6\u201310.\n(b) Petitioners\u2019 arguments for broader application of the proviso \nare unpersuasive.  While the proviso mirrors the language of \u00a72680\u2019s lead-in clause by stating that \u00a71346(b) \u201cshall apply\u201d rather than \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d this textual similarity does not demonstrate that the pro-\nviso applies to all exceptions, whic h form discrete instructions that \nmay be understood completely withou t reference to other provisions. \nThe absence of limiting language in the proviso\u2019s first sentence does \nnot expand its scope beyond subsec tion (h), as Congress accomplished \nthat limitation through the provis o\u2019s placement within the same sen-\ntence as the intentional-tort except ion.  Legislative history suggesting \nCongress intended to address wrong-house raids broadly cannot dis -\nplace what the law\u2019s terms clearly direct, as legislative history is not the law and Members of Congress may have had multiple purposes in\nmind when crafting the proviso.  Pp. 10\u201311.\n2. The Supremacy Clause does no t afford the United States a de-\nfense in FTCA suits. The FTCA is the \u201csupreme\u201d federal law governing \nthe United States\u2019 tort liability and serves as the exclusive remedy for \ndamages claims arising from federal employees\u2019 official conduct.  The \nstatute generally makes the governme nt liable under state law on the \nsame terms as a private individual would be liable under the law of the place where the tortious conduct occurred.  Because the FTCA in-corporates state law as the liability standard, there is typically no con-\nflict between federal and state law for the Supremacy Clause to re -\nsolve. While federal law may sometimes displace state law in FTCA suits where a constitutional text or  federal statute supplies controlling \nliability rules, the Eleventh Circuit identified no such federal statute \nor constitutional provision displacing Georgia tort law in this case. The court\u2019s reliance on In re Neagle , 135 U. S. 1, is misplaced, as that \n19th-century decision involved a federal officer\u2019s immunity from state criminal prosecution for acts necessary and proper in discharging fed-eral duties, not the federal government\u2019s liability under a statute that\nexpressly subjects it to state tort law on the same terms as private \nparties.  Section 2674 specifies the defenses available to the govern -\nment, including judicial or legislative immunity and other defenses to\nwhich the United States is entitled , but these do not include the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s novel Supremacy Clause defense.  Pp. 12\u201317.\n3. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit  should consider whether subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s discretionary -function exception bars either the plaintiffs\u2019 \nnegligent- or intentional-tort claims\u2014undertaking that assessment \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n 4 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nwithout reference to the mistaken view that the law enforcement pro-\nviso applies to subsection (a).  The court must then ask of any surviving \nclaims whether, under Georgia state law, a \u201cprivate individual under \nlike circumstances\u201d would be liable for the acts and omissions the \nplaintiffs allege, subject to the defenses discussed in \u00a72674\u2014not a Su -\npremacy Clause defense.\nRemaining questions surrounding whether and under what circum -\nstances the discretionary-function ex ception may ever foreclose a suit \nlike this one lie well beyond the tw o questions the Court granted cer-\ntiorari to address, and their resolu tion would benefit from the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s careful reexamination of this case in the first instance. \nPp. 17\u201318. \nVacated and remanded. \nGORSUCH , J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

UNITED STATES, ET AL . \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \n[June 12, 2025]\n JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court. \nIf federal officers raid the wrong house, causing property \ndamage and assaulting innocent occupants, may the home -\nowners sue the government for damages?  The answer is \nnot as obvious as it might be. All agree that the Federal\nTort Claims Act permits some su its for wrong-house raids. \nBut the scope of the Act\u2019s permission is much less clear.\nThis case poses two questions about the Act\u2019s application: \none concerning the FTCA\u2019s sovereign-immunity waiver, \nand the other touching on the defenses the United States \nmay assert. \nI \nA \nIn the predawn hours of October 18, 2017, the Federal\nBureau of Investigation raided the wrong house in subur-ban Atlanta. Officers meant to execute search and arrest \nwarrants at a suspected gang hideout, 3741 Landau Lane.Instead, they stormed a quiet  family home, 3756 Denville \nTrace, occupied by Hilliard To i Cliatt, his partner Curtrina\nMartin, and her 7-year-old son G. W.  App. to Pet. for Cert. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 2 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \n3a\u20134a. \nA six-member SWAT team, led by FBI Special Agent\nLawrence Guerra, breached the front door and detonated a \nflash-bang grenade. Id., at 7a\u20138a.  Fearing a home inva-\nsion, Mr. Cliatt and Ms. Martin hid in a bedroom closet. Id., \nat 8a. But the SWAT team soon found the couple\u2019s hiding \nspot, dragged Mr. Cliatt from the closet, \u201cthrew [him] down \non the floor,\u201d handcuffed him, and began \u201cbombarding [him] with questions.\u201d Id., at 79a. Meanwhile, another officer \ntrained his weapon on Ms. Martin, who was lying on thefloor half-naked, having fallen inside the closet.  Id., at 8a, \n89a. Only then did another officer stumble across some mail with the home\u2019s address on it and realize the team had \nthe wrong house. Id., at 8a. \nThe cause of the officers\u2019 mistake?  In preparation for the\nraid, Agent Guerra visited th e correct house to document\nits features and identify a staging area for the SWAT team. \nId., at 5a. But, he says, when he used his personal GPS to\nnavigate to 3741 Landau Lane on the day of the raid, it ledhim to 3756 Denville Trace.  631 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1287 \n(ND Ga. 2022).  No one could confirm as much later because \nAgent Guerra \u201cthrew . . . away\u201d his GPS device \u201cnot long after\u201d the raid.  Id., at 1288. And it seems the agents nei-\nther noticed the street sign for \u201cDenville Trace,\u201d nor thehouse number, which was visible on the mailbox at the end \nof the driveway. Ibid.; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38 . Apparently, too, \nAgent Guerra failed to appreciate that a different car was parked in the driveway, one \u201cnot present . . . during [his]\nprevious visit.\u201d 631 F. Supp. 3d, at 1288.\nLeft with personal injuries and property damage\u2014but\nfew explanations and no compensation\u2014Mr. Cliatt and Ms.Martin sued the United States. They did so under the Fed-eral Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72671 et seq. , alleging that \nthe officers had committed various negligent and inten -\ntional torts, App. 8\u201314. \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nAfter discovery and motions practice, the district court \nrejected each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and granted summary\njudgment to the government.  The Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed and, in doing so, relied on an understanding of the\nFTCA that no other circuit has adopted. To appreciate\nwhat sets the Eleventh Circuit apart and how its approach\naffected its analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, it helps tobegin by outlining how this suit would have proceeded else -\nwhere. \nThe FTCA allows those injured by federal employees to \nsue the United States for damages. The statute achieves \nthat end by waiving, in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b), the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s sovereign immunity for \u201ccertain torts committed \nby federal employees acting within the scope of their em-ployment.\u201d Brownback  v. King , 592 U. S. 209, 212 (2021) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the statute\u2019s waiver is subject to 13 exceptions that claw back the gov-ernment\u2019s immunity in certain circumstances. Set out in \n\u00a72680, most of these 13 exceptions are obviously inapplica -\nble to suits alleging police misconduct within the United States. But two in particular\u2014the discretionary-function \nexception and the intentional-tort exception\u2014sometimescome into play.\nIn a suit like this one, most courts begin by assessing the \nintentional-tort exception.  Lo cated in subsection (h) of\n\u00a72680, it prohibits claims alleging any of 11 enumerated \ntorts. But the exception is itself subject to a \u201claw enforce-\nment proviso.\u201d Millbrook v. United States , 569 U. S. 50, 55 \n(2013). That proviso countermands the exception with re-spect to six intentional torts (including assault, battery,\nfalse imprisonment, and false arrest) against \u201cinvestigative\nor law enforcement officers.\u201d \u00a72680(h). So if a plaintiff al-leges that a federal law enfo rcement officer committed one \nor more of those six torts, the proviso will ensure those \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n   4 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims survive an encounter wi th the intentional-tort ex-\nception. Id., at 55\u201356. \nNext, most courts turn to the discretionary-function ex-\nception. Housed in subsection (a) of \u00a72680, this exception\nbars \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d based on the exercise of an official\u2019s \u201cdis-\ncretionary function.\u201d Faced with that instruction, most \ncourts ask whether the exception precludes any of the plain-tiff \u2019s remaining tort claims.  And here, the answer is often \nless clear cut. The discretionary-function exception, this\nCourt has said, forbids suits challenging decisions that \u201cin-\nvolv[e] an element of judgment or choice\u201d of a \u201ckind that the \n. . . exception was designed to shield.\u201d  United States v. \nGaubert , 499 U. S. 315, 322\u2013323 (1991) (alteration in origi-\nnal; internal quotation marks omitted).  But several of our \nlower court colleagues report t hat they have \u201cstruggl[ed]\u201d to\ndiscern what this direction requires of them.  See, e.g., Xi v. \nHaugen , 68 F. 4th 824, 842 (CA3 2023) (Bibas, J., concur -\nring). So, for example, some lower courts have held that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not shield \u201ccareless\u201dor \u201cunconstitutional\u201d police conduct from judicial scrutiny, but others have taken a contrary view and read the excep-\ntion much more broadly. Id., at 843; Pet. for Cert. 28\u201334. \nFinally, if any of the plaintiff \u2019s claims survive the \ndiscretionary-function exception and thus fall within the\nFTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, courts turn to a third \nquestion: Is the government liable to the plaintiff on the \nmerits? When it comes to that question, the FTCA providesthat the government will usually be liable to the plaintiff if\na \u201cprivate individual under like circumstances,\u201d \u00a72674,\nwould be liable under \u201cthe law of the place\u201d where the gov-\nernment employee\u2019s wrongful \u201cact or omission occurred,\u201d \n\u00a71346(b)(1). Ordinarily, then, courts will find for the plain -\ntiff if he can demonstrate that federal officials committed a \ntort under applicable state law. See Brownback , 592 U. S., \nat 218. \nNow compare that approach to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nThat court begins much as others do, asking whether the \nlaw enforcement proviso permits a plaintiff \u2019s intentional-\ntort claims to advance past subsection (h)\u2019s intentional-tort \nexception. See Nguyen v. United States, 556 F. 3d 1244, \n1260 (2009).\nBut from there, the Eleventh Circuit proceeds quite dif-\nferently. Rather than asking whether the discretionary-function exception bars either the plaintiff \u2019s negligent-tort\nclaims or his intentional-tort claims, as most courts do, the \nEleventh Circuit applies that exception only to the plain-\ntiff \u2019s negligence claims.  The Eleventh Circuit does so be -\ncause, in its view, the law enforcement proviso does not justoverride the intentional-tort exce ption, it also overrides all \nthe other exceptions in \u00a72680, the discretionary-functionexception included.  Id., at 1257. Under that approach, any\nintentional-tort claim covered by the proviso automaticallyproceeds to the merits\u2014no matter what any other exceptionhas to say.\nTo compensate for its expansive and plaintiff-friendly\nreading of the proviso, the Eleventh Circuit then takes a restrictive and defendant-friendly view at the FTCA\u2019s lia-\nbility stage. In other courts, an FTCA plaintiff will usually\nprevail if he can show a \u201cprivate individual under like cir-\ncumstances,\u201d \u00a72674, would be liable under \u201cthe law of the\nplace\u201d where the government employee\u2019s wrongful \u201cact oromission occurred,\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1).  But in the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit, the government may assert a particular affirmative\ndefense under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause.  See \nDenson v. United States, 574 F. 3d 1318, 1347 (2009).  And \nthat defense, the Eleventh Circuit holds, defeats a claim whenever a law enforcement officer\u2019s contested actions bear \n\u201csome nexus with furthering fe deral policy and can reason-\nably be characterized as complying with the full range of \nfederal law.\u201d Id., at 1348; accord, Kordash v. United States, \n51 F. 4th 1289, 1293 (CA11 2022).\nApplying its unique approach to this case, the Eleventh \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nCircuit held that the law enforcement proviso spared the\nplaintiffs\u2019 intentional-tort clai ms from both the intentional-\ntort and the discretionary-functi on exceptions.  It dismissed \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 negligence cl aims under the discretionary-\nfunction exception because, in its view, Agent Guerra \u201cen-\njoyed discretion in how he prepared for the warrant execu-\ntion.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a\u201318a. And on the merits of \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 (remaining) intentional-tort claims, the court held that the government had a winning Supremacy Clause \ndefense. As a result, the Eleventh Circuit concluded, the \nUnited States was entitled to summary judgment.  Id., at \n18a\u201319a. \nWe agreed to take this case to examine the distinctive\nfeatures of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s approach\u2014namely (1)\nwhether the law enforcement pr oviso overrides not just the\nintentional-tort exception but also the discretionary-functionexception, and (2) whether the Supremacy Clause affords \nthe United States a defense in FTCA suits.  Pet. for Cert. 16, 25. 604 U. S. ___ (2025). \nII \nBegin with the law enforcement proviso.  Does it counter-\nmand only \u00a72680(h)\u2019s intentional-tort exception, as most circuits have concluded and the government argues?  Brief for Respondents 25; Xi, 68 F. 4th, at 842 (Bibas, J., concur-\nring) (collecting cases). Or does the proviso also override\nthe other exceptions in \u00a72680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception in subsection (a), as the Eleventh Circuit\nhas held and the plaintiffs contend?  Nguyen , 556 F. 3d, at \n1257; Brief for Petitioners 40. \nA \nTo answer that question, we turn to the relevant statu-\ntory text. Recall that \u00a71346(b) waives the federal govern-ment\u2019s sovereign immunity, subject to a list of 13 exceptions housed in \u00a72680.  Those exceptions are lettered (a) through \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n                 \n    \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n                 \n 7 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \n(n), with one letter unused.  Rather than setting the law \nenforcement proviso apart as a discrete provision at the end \nof that list, Congress folded it into subsection (h)\u2019s intentional-tort exception. Here\u2019s a sense of how the proviso (under -\nlined below) appears in context. \n\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of \nthis title shall not apply to\u2014 \n\u201c(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an\nemployee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or  regulation, whether or not\nsuch statute or regulation be valid, or based upon theexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n.  .  .  .  . \n\u201c(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest , malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de -\nceit, or interference with contract rights: Provided , That, \nwith regard to acts or omi ssions of invest igative or law \nenforcement officers of the United States Government, \nthe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of thistitle shall apply to any claim arising, on or after the dateof the enactment of this prov iso, out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arre st, abuse of process, or \nmalicious prosecution.  For the purpose of this subsec-\ntion, \u2018investigative or law enforcement officer\u2019 means \nany officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \n.  .  .  .  . \n\u201c(n) Any claim arising from the activities of a Fed-\neral land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or \na bank for cooperatives.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nThe proviso\u2019s placement supplies an immediate clue\nabout the scope of its application.  It appears in the same \nsubsection (and the same sentence) as the intentional-tort exception. Given that arrangement, an ordinary reader\nwould naturally presume that the proviso modifies only \nsubsection (h). An everyday example helps illustrate the \npoint. Suppose a wife leaves her husband a shopping list: \n\u201cPlease buy\u2014Apples.  Carrots. Steak: If there is a sale. Bread. Milk.\u201d The wife, we think, would be understandably \nfrustrated if her husband return ed home with only steak in\nhand because he could find nothing else discounted. Re-\nflecting that intuition about ordinary meaning, our cases\nrecognize that, absent reason to think otherwise, statutory\nprovisos generally modify only the provisions in which they \nsit. See McDonald v. United States, 279 U. S. 12, 20\u201321 \n(1929); Alaska v. United States, 545 U. S. 75, 106 (2005); \nA. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 154\u2013155 (2012) (Scalia\n& Garner).\nNothing about \u00a72680(h)\u2019s proviso gives us reason to think \nit works differently.  To the contrary, one textual clue after \nanother confirms that it follows the general rule.  Start with \nthe statute\u2019s grammatical structure.  Section 2680 contains \na lead-in clause (\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014\u201d) followed by a list \nof exceptions. In conjunction with the lead-in clause, each\nexception forms a stand-alone sentence ending with a pe-\nriod, operating as a \u201cdistinct,\u201d \u201cstructurally discrete\u201d provi-sion. Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , 543 \nU. S. 335, 344, and n. 4 (2005).  And, given that, it is hard\nto see how the law enforcement  proviso might apply beyond\nsubsection (h), modifying exceptions housed in separate\nsubsections (and separate sentences) elsewhere in \u00a72680.\nNotice, too, that subsection  (h) and its proviso work to -\ngether to address the same category of claims: intentional torts. Subsection (h)\u2019s intent ional-tort exception excludes \nfrom the FTCA\u2019s sovereign-immunity waiver claims for \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 9 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \ntorts like \u201cassault, battery, false imprisonment, [and] false\narrest.\u201d The proviso then undoes that assertion of sover -\neign immunity for some of th ose same torts when commit-\nted by \u201cinvestigative or law en forcement officers.\u201d  By con-\ntrast, the proviso does not so much as mention the issues\naddressed by \u00a72680\u2019s other exceptions, like claims for lost\nmail, combat injuries, or the imposition of quarantines.\n\u00a72680(b), (f ), (j).  That the proviso is \u201cconfined\u201d to the same\n\u201csubject-matter\u201d as subsection (h)\u2019s \u201cprincipal clause\u201d\nstands as more evidence yet that it \u201crefers only to the pro-\nvision to which it is attached.\u201d United States v. Morrow , \n266 U. S. 531, 535 (1925).\nThe proviso\u2019s second sentence is telling as well.  It defines \nthe phrase \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d In \ndoing so, the sentence tells us that the definition applies \nonly to \u201cthis subsection\u201d ( i.e., subsection (h)), even though\nthe phrase \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d also appears in subsec-tion (c)\u2019s exception for claims arising from tax and customs collection. \u00a72680(c), (h) . If Congress had wished the proviso \nto modify each of the exceptions in \u00a72680, it might have pro-vided a section-wide definition, rather than a limited defi-\nnition just for subsection (h).\nIf more evidence were needed, comparing this statute\nwith others would supply it.  Often, Congress drafts statu-tory lists followed by a proviso in a separate paragraph at\nthe end. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71383(a)(2)(F)(ii)(II), \n6928(f )(2). Sometimes, that placement can suggest that a \nproviso relates to all the prec eding subparts, not just the \nnearest one.  Scalia & Garner 156.  But here Congress chosea different course, folding the proviso into a single excep-tion, rather than appending it to the end of the full list of \nexceptions. And that choice, too, suggests this proviso ap-\nplies to subsection (h) alone.  See Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. \nTexas , 596 U. S. 685, 704 (2022). \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 10 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nSeeking to defend the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the\nproviso applies broadly across all of \u00a72680\u2019s exceptions, the\nplaintiffs offer a number of thoughtful arguments.  But, to \nour eyes, none can overcome the textual evidence we have\njust laid out.\nFirst, the plaintiffs ask us to focus on how the proviso\nmirrors \u00a72680\u2019s lead-in clause.  Brief for Petitioners 42. The lead-in clause, they observe, preserves the government\u2019s \nsovereign immunity by instructing that \u00a71346(b)\u2019s waiver\n\u201cshall not apply to \u201d claims covered by the exceptions.  \u00a72680\n(emphasis added). Meanwhile, the proviso countermandsthat direction by instructing that \u00a71346(b)\u2019s waiver \u201c shall \napply \u201d to certain claims. \u00a72680(h) (emphasis added).  Be-\ncause the language of the proviso mirrors the language ofthe lead-in clause, the plaintiffs submit, Congress must\nhave meant for the proviso to have the last word with re -\nspect to each of the FTCA\u2019s exceptions.  Id., at 42. That \nconclusion, however, does not follow from its premise.  Yes, \nthe proviso and lead-in clause contain similar language.And, yes, the proviso surely countermands the lead-in \nclause for purposes of subsection (h). But none of that \nmeans the proviso speaks to ot her exceptions that work to-\ngether with the lead-in language to form discrete instruc -\ntions that \u201cmay be understood completely without readingany further.\u201d Jama , 543 U. S., at 344. \nSecond, the plaintiffs remind us that the proviso\u2019s second, \ndefinitional sentence applies to \u201cthis subsection,\u201d but the \nproviso\u2019s first, substantive part contains no such limiting language. Brief for Petitioners 42\u201343 (quoting \u00a72680(h)). And that difference, the plaintiffs say, suggests that the \nfirst, substantive part applies throughout \u00a72680.  Id., at 42\u2013 \n43. Again, however, we do not see it.  Congress had no need \nto include similar limiting language in the first part of the \nproviso to confine its application to subsection (h).  Con -\ngress accomplished just that by placing the proviso\u2019s first \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n 11 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \npart in the same sentence as the intentional-tort exception. \nMeanwhile, in the proviso\u2019s second sentence, Congress ar-\nguably needed to confine the definition of \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d to \u201cthis  subsection\u201d to ensure that \nthe phrase \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d carries a different \nmeaning when it appears in subsection (c).\nThird, the plaintiffs resort to legislative history.  They\npoint to a committee report discussing how Congress en-acted the proviso in response to two wrong-house raids \nmuch like their own.  Id., at 8\u201310, 44; see S. Rep. No. 93\u2013 \n588, p. 3 (1973).  And, the plaintiffs argue, unless the pro-viso is given broad effect across \u00a72680, it will not fulfill Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose of ensuring that wrong-house-raid cases may proceed.  But this argument stumbles, too.  Few pieces\nof legislation pursue any single \u201cpurpos[e] at all costs.\u201d \nAmerican Express Co.  v. Italian Colors Restaurant , 570 \nU. S. 228, 234 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd Members of Congress may well have had more thanone purpose in mind when adding the proviso to the FTCA.\nPerhaps some thought amending subsection (h) alone and \nleaving others untouched would strike a suitable balance \nbetween immunity and liability. Perhaps others concluded\nthere was no need to apply the proviso more broadly be-cause no other exception would shield the government from \nliability for wrong-house raids. Whatever the reason, no amount of guesswork about the purposes behind legislation\ncan displace what the law\u2019s terms clearly direct.  \u201c[L]egisla-\ntive history is not the law.\u201d Epic Systems Corp.  v. Lewis , \n584 U. S. 497, 523 (2018). \nIII \nThat takes us to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s second outlier po-\nsition and the second question presented.  May the United States defeat an FTCA suit by invoking the Supremacy Clause and showing that a federal officer\u2019s acts had \u201csome \nnexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and \u201ccompli[ed] with \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nthe full range of federal law\u201d? App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because the govern-\nment now concedes that it enjoys no such defense, the Court appointed Christopher Mills as amicus  to represent the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s views.  604 U. S. ___ (2025).  He has ably discharged his responsibilities.  But in the end, we find the \ngovernment\u2019s concession co mmendable and correct: The \nFTCA does not permit the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy\nClause defense. \nThe Supremacy Clause supplies a rule of decision when \nfederal and state laws conflict.  It provides that the \u201cCon-\nstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any\nstate to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d  Art. VI, cl. 2.  So, \nfor example, when a regulated party cannot comply with\nboth federal and state directives, the Supremacy Clause \ntells us the state law must yield.  See, e.g., Virginia Ura-\nnium, Inc. v. Warren , 587 U. S. 761, 767 (2019) (opinion of \nG\nORSUCH , J.). \nThe FTCA is the \u201csupreme\u201d federal law addressing the \nUnited States\u2019 liability for torts committed by its agents.  It supplies the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for damages claims arising out of federal employees\u2019 official conduct.  See Hui v. Cas-\ntaneda , 599 U. S. 799, 806 (2010).  And, as we have seen, \nthe government will usually be liable if a \u201cprivate individ-\nual under like circumstances,\u201d \u00a72674, \u201cwould be liable to \nthe claimant in accordance with the law of the place where \nthe act or omission occurred,\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1).  Accordingly, a \nplaintiff may generally prevail in an FTCA suit by demon-strating that \u201cthe State in which the alleged misconduct oc-\ncurred would permit a cause of action for that misconduct \nto go forward.\u201d  Carlson v. Green , 446 U. S. 14, 23 (1980). \nBecause the FTCA\u2019s liability rule incorporates state law, \nin most cases there is no conflict for the Supremacy Clause \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nto resolve. Take this case. Georgia law supplies the rele-\nvant \u201claw of the place\u201d where the officers\u2019 tortious conduct\noccurred. \u00a71346(b)(1). And Georgia law would permit ahomeowner to sue a private person for damages if that per-\nson intentionally or negligently raided his house and as-\nsaulted him.  See App. 10\u201313 (citing Hendricks v. Southern \nBell Tel. & Tel. Co. , 193 Ga. App. 264, 264\u2013265, 387 S. E.\n2d 593, 594\u2013595 (1989), for assault and battery and Lyttle \nv. United States , 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1301 (MD Ga. 2012), \nfor negligence). So when th e FTCA, the relevant federal \nlaw in this field, instructs co urts to apply those same state\nrules to decide whether the United States is liable to the plaintiffs, there is no discord between the two. \nTo be sure, it is possible (though rare) for federal and\nstate law to conflict in an FTCA suit.  So, for example, in Hess v. United States , this Court held that federal maritime \nlaw supplied the \u201claw of the place\u201d governing an FTCA suit involving an accident on the Columbia River. 361 U. S. 314, \n318, and n. 7 (1960).  Though the accident \u201coccurred within\nthe State of Oregon,\u201d it happened \u201con navigable waters . . . within the reach of admiralty jurisdiction.\u201d  Id., at 318. As \na result, federal maritime law displaced state tort law, just\nas it would in \u201can action between private parties.\u201d  Ibid . In \nmuch the same way, federal law will control other FTCA suits where \u201ca litigant [can] poin t specifically to a constitu-\ntional text or a federal statute\u201d that supplies controlling li-ability rules, displacing contrary state law. Virginia Ura-\nnium, 587 U. S., at 767 (internal quotation marks omitted); \nsee, e.g., PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing , 564 U. S. 604, 618 (2011). \nIn this case, however, the Eleventh Circuit did not iden-\ntify any federal statute or constitutional provision displac -\ning Georgia tort law. Instead, the court of appeals pointed\nto a line of cases stemming from this Court\u2019s decision in \nIn re Neagle , 135 U. S. 1, 75 (1890).  App. to Pet. for Cert. \n16a\u201317a (citing Denson , 574 F. 3d, at 1336\u20131337).  Those \ncases, the Eleventh Circuit has observed, hold that federal \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n 14 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nOpinion of the Court \nofficers may sometimes defeat state prosecutions against \nthem by demonstrating that their actions, though criminal\nunder state law, were \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d in the dis -\ncharge of their federal responsibilities.  Id. , at 1346\u20131347 \n(discussing In re Neagle ). In the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view, \nthat same logic works to foreclose FTCA suits like the plain-\ntiffs\u2019. 574 F. 3d, at 1346\u20131347; Kordash, 51 F. 4th, at 1293\u2013 \n1294. \nTo appreciate why that view is mistaken, a little history\nhelps. In re Neagle  involved an affair, a homicide, and a \nhabeas petition.  In 1883, Sarah Althea Hill claimed to be the wife of U. S. Senator William Sharon and sought a \nshare of his fortune in acrimonious California divorce pro-\nceedings. Sharon admitted an a ffair but insisted that Hill \nhad forged the pair\u2019s handwritten marriage contract. Hill \nhired David Terry to represent her.  A former Chief Justice \nof the California Supreme Court, Terry had resigned that post after killing (another) U. S. Senator in a duel.  As the \nlitigation wore on, lawyer and client married.\nEventually, the dispute be tween Hill and Sharon wound \nup before U. S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field while he was riding circuit.  Terry  and Justice Field were no \nstrangers, having served together on the California Su-preme Court. Even so, Justice Field issued a devastating\nruling against Hill.  As he announced his decision, Hill leapt from her seat, denounced the Justice as \u201cbought,\u201d and had \nto be carried from the courtr oom.  Joining the fracas, Terry\npunched a marshal and brandished a bowie knife.  Even af-ter the couple spent time in jail for contempt, they contin-\nued to issue threats against Justice Field.\n1 \nThose events found their way into the U. S. Reports this \nway.

Lewis \n478; In re Neagle , 135 U. S., at 51\u201352.  That decision proved \nprescient, for Terry soon cornered the Justice on a train andattacked him.  Id ., at 52\u201354.  Intervening to protect the Jus-\ntice, Neagle shot and killed Terry. Ibid. After the shooting,\nCalifornia authorities arrested Neagle and began prosecut-\ning him for murder.  Neagle countered by filing a petition \nfor a writ of habeas corpus in federal court seeking his re -\nlease. Ibid. \nWhen Neagle\u2019s petition reached this Court, it agreed the\nwrit should issue, reasoning that the Supremacy Clause\nshielded him from state crimi nal charges.  Without some \nsuch protection, the Court concluded, California could frus -\ntrate federal law by prosecuting a federal marshal \u201cfor anact which he was authorized to do by the law of the United\nStates,\u201d an act \u201cwhich it was his duty to do,\u201d and in circum-\nstances where he \u201cdid no mo re than what was necessary \nand proper.\u201d Id., at 75\u201376. \n Memorable as In re Neagle  may be, we do not see how it \ninforms the prosaic task of applying the FTCA.  The Court\u2019s \ndecision may stand for the proposition that federal law will\nsometimes preempt a state criminal law when it conflicts\nwith a federal officer\u2019s duties \u2014 a n d  d o  s o  e v e n  i n  t h e  a b -\nsence of express federal legislation overriding the state law in question.  But In re Neagle does not speak to a situation\nwhere, as here, Congress has entered the field and ex-\npressly bound the federal government to accept liability un-\nder state tort law on the same terms as a \u201cprivate individ-\nual.\u201d \u00a72674.  After all, no private individual could deploy \nIn re Neagle  to his advantage.  It has only ever worked to\nshield \u201c[f]ederal officers who are discharging their duties.\u201d \nOhio v.

After setting forth the general rule that the gov -\nernment can be held liable under state tort law on the same terms as a \u201cprivate individual,\u201d \u00a72674 adds that the govern -\nment may \u201cassert any defense based upon judicial or legis-\nlative immunity which otherwise would have been availa-\nble to the employee of the United States whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, as well as any other de -\nfenses to which the United States  is entitled.\u201d  But none of \nthese defenses include In re Neagle . That decision did not \nrecognize a \u201cjudicial or legislative immunity.\u201d  Nor has it been understood as a \u201cdefens[e] to which the United States\nis entitled,\u201d but instead (and again) as a shield \u201c[f]ederal \nofficers\u201d may assert.

We can say\nthis much: The plaintiffs\u2019 intentional-tort claims survive\ntheir encounter with subsection (h) thanks to the law en-\nforcement proviso, as the Eleventh Circuit recognized. But \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2To date at least, this Court has also generally understood In re Neagle\nas providing federal officers a shield  against only state criminal prosecu-\ntion, not (as here) state tort liability.  See, e.g., Ohio v. Thomas , 173 U.

As we have explained, the Eleventh Circuit must undertake that\nassessment without reference to its mistaken view that the \nlaw enforcement proviso applies to subsection (a).  Should \nsome or all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims survive the discretionary-\nfunction exception, the Eleventh Circuit must then askwhether, under Georgia state law, a \u201cprivate individual un-\nder like circumstances\u201d would be liable for the acts and \nomissions the plaintiffs allege, subject to the defenses dis-cussed in \u00a72674\u2014not a Supremacy Clause defense nowhere \nmentioned there. \nHaving resolved that much, the plaintiffs ask us to decide\nmore still. See Brief for Petitioners 19\u201340. In particular, \nthey call on us to determine whether and under what cir-cumstances the discretionary-function exception bars suits \nfor wrong-house raids and similar misconduct. Unless we \ntake up that further question, they worry, the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit on remand may take too broad a view of the exception \nand dismiss their claims again.  After all, the plaintiffs observe, in the past that court has suggested that the\ndiscretionary-function exception bars any claim \u201c unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifica lly prescribes\u2019 a course of con-\nduct\u201d and thus deprives an official of all discretion. Id., at \n36 (quoting Shivers v. United States , 1 F. 4th 924, 931 \n(CA11 2021)). And that approach, the plaintiffs insist, is\nboth seriously mistaken and at odds with how other circuitsunderstand the exception. Brief for Petitioners 36.  Some \ncourts, for instance, ha ve held that the discretionary-function\nexception does not protect co nduct \u201cmarked by individual\ncarelessness or laziness,\u201d rather than \u201cpolicy considera-\ntions.\u201d Rich v. United States , 811 F. 3d 140, 147 (CA4 \n2015). Some courts do not apply the exception when lawenforcement officers violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. Xi, 68 F. 4th, at 839 (\u201cgovernment officials never \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 MARTIN v.

See id., at 843 (Bibas, J., concurring). The \nplaintiffs ask us to endorse decisions like these, apply their \nreasoning to this case, and hold it survives the discretionary-\nfunction exception. Brief for Petitioners 39\u201340 \nWe readily acknowledge that  different lower courts have\ntaken different views of the discretionary-function excep-tion. We acknowledge, too, that important questions sur-\nround whether and under what circumstances that excep-\ntion may ever foreclose a suit like this one.  But those \nquestions lie well beyond the two we granted certiorari to \naddress. And before addressing them, we would benefit\nfrom the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s careful reexamination of this \ncase in the first instance.  It is work enough for the day to \nanswer the questions we took this case to resolve, clear \naway the two faulty assumptions on which that court has\nrelied in the past, and redirect it to the proper inquiry. \nThe judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is vacated, and the \ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion. \nIt is so ordered. \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n _________________ \n_________________ 1 Cite as: 605 U.

The law enforcement proviso modifies\nonly the subsection in which it is located: Section 2680(h)\u2019s\nintentional-tort exception.  Ante , at 6\u201311. The United \nStates, moreover, may not defeat an FTCA suit simply by \n\u201cshowing that a federal officer\u2019s acts had \u2018some nexus with\nfurthering federal policy\u2019 and \u2018compli[ed] with the full range \nof federal law.\u2019 \u201d  Ante , at 11\u201312 (alteration in original).\nWith those two principles clarified, I also agree that theEleventh Circuit must now consider on remand whether the FTCA\u2019s discretionary-function  exception bars plaintiffs\u2019\nnegligent- and intentional-tort claims. Ante,  at 17\u201318. I \nwrite separately to underscore that there is reason to think\nthe discretionary-function exception may not apply to these \nclaims. \nI \nThe FTCA shields the United States from liability for \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a federal employee\u2019s \u201cexercise or per-\n \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 MARTIN v.

S. C. \u00a72680(a).  This Court has set forth a two-part test that governs the application of \n\u00a72680(a), known as the discretionary-function exception.\nFirst, courts must consider the nature of the official\u2019s con-\nduct and decide whether it \u201c \u2018involv[es] an element of judg-\nment or choice.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Gaubert , 499 U. S. 315, \n322 (1991) (quoting Berkovitz  v. United States, 486 U. S. \n531, 536 (1988)). \u201cThe requirement of judgment or choice,\u201d \nthis Court has explained, \u201cis not satisfied if a \u2018federal stat-\nute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of \naction for an employee to follow.\u2019 \u201d  499 U. S., at 322 . In \nsuch circumstances, \u201c \u2018the employee has no rightful option \nbut to adhere to the directive.\u2019 \u201d  Ibid. \nEven where a federal employee retains an element of \nchoice, however, the exception does not apply reflexively. After all, it is rare for statutes or regulations to prescribe\nan official\u2019s required course of conduct down to the very last \ndetail, so some degree of choice will almost invariably re-main.  Thus, this Court has re quired lower courts to deter-\nmine, at the second step, whether \u201cth[e] judgment is of thekind that the discretionary fu nction exception was designed\nto shield.\u201d Berkovitz , 486 U. S., at 536.  Because \u201c[t]he basis\nfor the discretionary function exception was Congress\u2019 de -\nsire to \u2018prevent judicial \u201csecond-guessing\u201d of legislative and\nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and\npolitical policy through the medium of an action in tort,\u2019 \u201d \nthis Court has clarified that the exception protects onlythose governmental actions and decisions that are them-selves \u201cbased on considerations of public policy.\u201d  Id., at \n536\u2013537 (quoting United States v. S. A. Empresa De Viacao \nAerea Rio Grandense , 467 U. S. 797, 814 (1984)); see \nGaubert , 499 U. S., at 323. \nTo that end, this Court has said, it is \u201cobviou[s]\u201d that \nsome discretionary acts perf ormed by Government agents \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 3 Cite as: 605 U. S. ____ (2025) \nSOTOMAYOR , J., concurring \n\u201care within the scope of [their] employment but not within \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d  Id., at 325, n. 7.  If a \nfederal banking regulator \u201cdrove an automobile on a mis-\nsion connected with his official duties and negligently col-\nlided with another car,\u201d for example, the Court has made \nclear that \u201cthe exception would not apply.\u201d Ibid. That is \nbecause, while \u201cdriving requires the constant exercise ofdiscretion, the official\u2019s decisi ons in exercising that discre-\ntion can hardly be said to be grounded in regulatory policy.\u201d \nIbid. \nIt has been 34 years since this Court last weighed in on\nthe discretionary-function exception, see Gaubert , 499 U. S. \n315, and despite substantial percolation in the courts of ap-\npeals, the \u201cexact boundaries of the exception remain un -\nclear,\u201d 14 C. Wright, A. Miller, & H. Hershkoff, Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a73658.1 (4th ed. Supp. 2025).  The \nCourt today resolves one of the Circuit splits regarding the\nexception\u2019s application: whether claims that fall within the \nFTCA\u2019s law enforcement proviso must necessarily fall out-\nside of the discretionary-function exception.  Yet, as the Court recognizes, ante,  at 17\u201318, several additional points\nof disagreement remain, including whether allegedly \u201cun-constitutional conduct necessarily falls outside the excep -\ntion\u201d because officials lack dis cretion to violate the Consti-\ntution, and \u201cwhether the exception applies when the challenged act was careless rather than a considered exer-\ncise of discretion.\u201d Xi v. Haugen , 68 F. 4th 824, 843 (CA3\n2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (describing these Circuit splits). Given the enduring questions about how to apply \nthe discretionary-function exception, and the divergent ap -\nproaches taken by the Circuits, it is long past time for this \nCourt to weigh in on the exception\u2019s scope. \nEven without further intervention by this Court, how-\never, there is reason to question the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s sug-\ngestion in the decision below that the discretionary-func-tion exception might apply \u201c \u2018unless  a source of federal law \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n 4 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES \nSOTOMAYOR , J., concurring \n\u201cspecifically prescribes\u201d a [fede ral employee\u2019s] course of con-\nduct.\u2019 \u201d  2024 WL 1716235, *6 (2024) (quoting Shivers v. \nUnited States , 1 F. 4th 924, 931 (CA11 2021); emphasis in\noriginal). That approach, which even the Government does\nnot defend before this Court,  would run headlong into\nthis Court\u2019s precedents. Gaubert , after all, applies the \ndiscretionary-function exception only where an official\u2019s ac-tions both involve an element of judgment and rely on pub-\nlic policy considerations. See 499 U. S., at 322\u2013323; see also \nBerkovitz , 486 U. S., at 536\u2013537.  Whether federal law pre-\nscribes a particular course of action resolves only the first\nof Gaubert \u2019s two questions. The second question (whether\nan officer\u2019s decisions were \u201c \u2018based on considerations of pub-\nlic policy,\u2019 \u201d 499 U. S., at 323) remains live.  Were it other-\nwise, a federal official\u2019s neg ligent driving decisions would \nfall beyond the reach of the discretionary-function excep-\ntion only if federal law or policy specifically prescribed an officer\u2019s permissible maneuvers on the road.  Cf. id., at 325, \nn. 7. \nII \nAgent Guerra\u2019s preparation to execute search and arrest \nwarrants at 3741 Landau Lane, and his subsequent deci-sion to raid Martin and Cliatt\u2019s home at 3756 Denville \nTrace, bear some resemblance to Gaubert \u2019s negligent driv-\ning hypothetical. Like driving, executing a warrant alwaysinvolves some measure of discretion.  Yet it is hard to see \nhow Guerra\u2019s conduct in this case, including his allegedly \nnegligent choice to use his personal GPS and his failure to \ncheck the street sign or house number on the mailbox before\nbreaking down Martin\u2019s door and terrorizing the home\u2019s \noccupants, involved the kind of policy judgments that the \ndiscretionary-function exception was designed to protect. \nThe FTCA\u2019s history, too, co nfirms Congress\u2019s intention to\nsubject the United States to liability for intentional torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers like Agent Guerra. \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  5 Cite as: 605 U.

See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(h).  That changed,however, in response to an episode that will sound familiar\nto readers of the majority opinion. See ante,  at 2. \nIn April 1973, Herbert and Evelyn Giglotto awoke in\ntheir Collinsville, Illinois, townhouse \u201cto the sound of some-one smashing down their door and bursting into their \nhouse.\u201d J. Boger, M. Gitenstein, & P. Verkuil , The Federal \nTort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment: An Inter -\npretative Analysis, 54 N. C. L. Rev. 497, 500 (1976).  After 15 state and federal officers ransacked the Giglottos\u2019 home, \ntied them up at gunpoint, and threatened to shoot Mr. Gi -\nglotto if he moved, the officers realized they \u201c\u2018ha[d] thewrong people.\u2019 \u201d  Ibid. The officers eventually moved on to\nthe home of Donald Askew, where they terrorized yet an-\nother innocent couple before confessing they had acted on a \n\u201c\u2018bad tip. \u2019\u201d Id., at 501. \nThe Collinsville raids garnered national attention, in -\ncluding from the United States Senate.  See S. Rep. No. 93\u2013588, pp. 2\u20133 (1973); see also Brief for Members of Congress \nas Amici Curiae 8\u201312. Noting that \u201c[t]here [was] no effec-\ntive legal remedy against th e Federal Government for the \nactual physical damage, much less the pain, suffering andhumiliation to which the Collinsville families ha[d] been \nsubjected,\u201d the Senate Committee on Government Opera-\ntions proposed an amendment to the FTCA.  See S. Rep. \nNo. 93\u2013588, at 2.  The solution was to add a proviso to theend of the intentional-tort exception that \u201cdeprive[s] the \nFederal Government of the de fense of sovereign immunity\u201d \nfor FTCA suits arising out of the state-law torts of \u201cassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prose-\ncution, or abuse of process\u201d by federal law enforcement of-ficers.

Whatever else is true of  that exception, any interpre-\ntation should allow for liability  in the very cases Congress\namended the FTCA to remedy. See Van Buren v. United \nStates, 593 U.

L. Rev. 654 Recovering the Lost Meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s \u201cDiscretionary Function Exception\u201d Volume 138 Issue 2 December 2024 See full issue Download See Footnotes Since 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act1 (FTCA) has waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for damages claims brought against the United States for the tortious conduct of its employees.2 This waiver has allowed those wronged by a federal officer to seek recovery through claims predicated on the common law tort of the state in which the wrong occurred.3 But that waiver is subject to a litany of exceptions.4 One is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02680(a), which retains the government\u2019s immunity for any claim based on an employee\u2019s performance or failure to perform \u201ca discretionary function or duty\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d5 The lower courts have interpreted this \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d capaciously, rendering it remarkably broad and applicable to innumerable acts.6 In large part because of this, when the government has invoked the exception at the motion to dismiss stage, it has succeeded in dismissing nearly seventy-five percent of claims.7 But notable disagreements persist concerning the exception\u2019s bounds. One such disagreement has resulted in a split amongst the courts of appeals. It concerns the interplay between the discretionary function exception and the U.S. Constitution. Does the exception immunize the government from tort claims that also constitute constitutional violations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even though the Constitution cannot form the basis of a plaintiff\u2019s FTCA tort claim?8 Or does the Constitution place bounds on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that the exception can immunize? For instance, imagine a case in which a U.S. Park Police Officer arrested a woman for organizing a large prayer service on National Park grounds.9 Her arrest was not legally authorized and thus could constitute false arrest under the common law. If she brought an FTCA claim against the United States alleging false arrest, the government would, in the ordinary course, move to dismiss on grounds that the discretionary function exception applies.10 But could she successfully oppose that motion by arguing that the arrest plausibly violated her First Amendment rights, so the exception cannot apply? That question has real ramifications. Many claims that could be pleaded as constitutional violations could also be pleaded as violations of state tort law.11 For instance, many Fourth Amendment violations overlap with torts such as battery and invasion of privacy.12 So plaintiffs alleging official federal misconduct can pursue two damages claims: (1) an FTCA claim against the federal government for the tort and (2) a claim against the officer in their personal capacity for the constitutional violation.13 But today, plaintiffs will have trouble succeeding on the latter claim\u00a0\u2014\u00a0commonly referred to as a Bivens action for the 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,14 which implied a private right to damages relief for constitutional violations.15 Over the last few decades, the Court has appreciably cut back the availability of Bivens remedies.16 Judicially created causes of action, in its eyes, impermissibly blur the constitutional lines between legislative and judicial power.17 With Bivens largely gutted, the FTCA provides virtually the only path to damages relief for individuals harmed by a federal officer\u2019s unconstitutional conduct. And whether that path is a feasible one turns on whether the discretionary function exception applies to unconstitutional conduct. For almost fifty years, nearly every court of appeals to consider the issue reached the same conclusion. The government could not invoke the discretionary function exception in response to an FTCA claim if the tort alleged also constituted a constitutional violation.18 These courts generally reasoned that \u201c[i]t is, of course, a tautology that a federal official cannot have discretion to behave unconstitutionally.\u201d19 This proposition was considered so \u201celementary\u201d that these courts adopted this stance with little justification or interpretation of the FTCA itself.20 But in 2019, some circuits began challenging this entrenched conclusion. With Judge Easterbrook writing for a majority, the Seventh Circuit declared: \u201c[T]he theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d21 The Eleventh Circuit followed, describing the dominant view as writing in an \u201cextra-textual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion\u2019\u201d into the statute.22 The Seventh and Eleventh Circuits largely rooted their arguments in the text. Section 2680(a) applies \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused,\u201d so the statute is \u201cunambiguous and categorical\u201d in its scope, they argued.23 It does not \u201ccarve[] out certain behavior,\u201d even unconstitutional behavior, from the exception.24 This makes sense, they said, because \u201cCongress did not create the FTCA to address constitutional violations at all but, rather, to address violations of state tort law.\u201d25 And Congress made that explicit when it amended the FTCA in 1988, clarifying its inapplicability to claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d26 That amendment, both courts argued, proved that FTCA claims must be considered \u201cwithout regard to constitutional theories.\u201d27 The resulting split has spurred myriad commentators to side with the majority view, but largely with defenses that double down on that view\u2019s original axiom\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that any other reading of the exception is simply incompatible with the Constitution.28 This Note offers a different tack that places the majority view on firmer footing. It argues that Congress transplanted the common law term \u201cdiscretion,\u201d which governed officer suits at common law, into the discretionary function exception. And it demonstrates how that exception, when properly interpreted against this common law backdrop, retains the government\u2019s immunity only for \u201cconstitutionally permissible\u201d discretionary functions.29 Part I explains the doctrine of \u201cdiscretion\u201d that governed officer suits at common law. This Part argues the predominant view at common law was that the Constitution placed boundaries on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that could be conferred on officers. Part II discusses the upshot for interpreting the discretionary function exception. And it shows how interpreting \u201cdiscretion\u201d as referring to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion\u201d fits within the larger mechanics of the FTCA\u2019s scheme and Supreme Court doctrine implementing it. Part III concludes by discussing the implications of this interpretation for how plaintiffs looking to vindicate constitutional rights through tort suits under the FTCA should plead their FTCA claims. I.\u00a0\u00a0The Discretionary Function Exception\u2019s Common Law Backdrop When the FTCA was enacted in 1946, it did not emerge ex nihilo. Rather, it built upon a long tradition of official accountability rooted in tort law that prevailed since the early republic. Prior to the FTCA\u2019s passage, individuals could not receive damages directly from the United States for the tortious conduct of its officers.30 Sovereign immunity barred any suit for money damages brought directly against the United States.31 But it did not bar suit against the officers who committed the wrongs.32 Throughout the nineteenth century, individuals wronged by official misconduct sought redress against individual officers by suing them in tort.33 And if the officer was found liable, the officer could in turn seek indemnification from the government in the form of a private bill from Congress.34 In the era prior to the Civil War, about sixty percent of officers who sought indemnity received it.35 But by the early twentieth century, this practice had become arduous and distracting for Congress.36 And so in 1946, Congress enacted the FTCA to replace the antiquated scheme. Given this history, one cannot understand the modern regime without first grasping its common law foundations. This Part begins by examining the common law roots of \u201cdiscretion\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a doctrinal fixture in officer suits at common law that dictated the extent to which an individual executive official could be held liable for misconduct. It then draws upon examples of individual officer suits at common law to explain how the common law viewed the Constitution as imposing constraints on discretion. A.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDiscretion\u201d at Common Law As early as Marbury v. Madison,37 the Supreme Court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0apparently motivated by separation of powers concerns\u00a0\u2014\u00a0articulated the principle that courts should not \u201cenquire\u201d into how officers \u201cperform duties in which they have\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretion.\u201d38 By the mid-nineteenth century, courts captured this immunity principle through a distinction between \u201cministerial\u201d and \u201cdiscretionary\u201d functions.39 Officials had discretionary rather than ministerial duties when the law gave them the authority to use their own judgment to decide how to best carry out their obligations.40 Because this latitude of judgment was similar to that granted to judges,41 discretionary authority for executive officials was sometimes referred to as \u201cquasi-judicial.\u201d42 Courts used this distinction to determine the individual damages liability of an officer for carrying out his duties improperly.43 To be sure, the line between ministerial and discretionary functions was not always clear. Courts did not always agree about whether a particular duty constituted a ministerial or a discretionary one.44 For example, when the FTCA was enacted, state courts were divided over whether a warden\u2019s duty to preserve the health and safety of jails and their occupants was ministerial or discretionary in nature.45 And as the distinction developed throughout the early twentieth century, some criticized it as being largely indeterminate and unhelpful for deciding the proper scope of an officer\u2019s liability.46 Professor Louis Jaffe described it as \u201ca way of stating rather than arriving at the result,\u201d merely a \u201cconvenient device for extending the area of nonliability without making the reasons explicit.\u201d47 And Dean William Prosser\u2019s 1941 Handbook of the Law of Torts labeled it a \u201crather unworkable distinction.\u201d48 But regardless of the academic disdain for the distinction, it remained alive and well in the courts. Through the early twentieth century, courts consistently employed the distinction to determine whether an officer could be held liable in damages for his misdeeds.49 B.\u00a0\u00a0The Boundaries of Common Law Discretion Nonetheless, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was not a blank permission slip. As this Part describes, even if a court found that an officer was delegated \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority, it could still find the officer liable for his misdeeds. This is because a separate principle generally embraced at common law stated that \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers were shielded from liability only if they did not \u201cact wholly outside of their jurisdiction or official authority.\u201d50 As Professor James Pfander helpfully describes it, this \u201cdiscretion\u201d was a \u201czone.\u201d51 As long as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers operated within that zone, they \u201cwere free to exercise their best judgment without judicial oversight.\u201d52 But if a court determined that an officer \u201cact[ed] beyond his jurisdiction,\u201d as the Supreme Court put it in the 1849 case Wilkes v. Dinsman,53 that court would treat the officer \u201cas not acting in the capacity of an officer at all\u201d54 but rather as merely a private citizen, stripped of any official defenses from suit.55 How would a court determine when an officer had stepped outside these boundaries? One cannot and should not pretend that courts were always consistent. But the common law tended to embrace the principle that an officer could exceed these bounds by contravening the Constitution.56 That is, \u201cdiscretion,\u201d no matter how broadly conferred, could not dissolve constitutional limits. This Part explores the two types of paradigmatic common law cases that illustrate this principle. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Tortious Conduct.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0When an individual was harmed by official misconduct at common law, they \u201ccould normally seek redress by invoking forms of action available at common law and in equity that included suits against governmental officials under ordinary tort law.\u201d57 The claim was not pled as a constitutional violation. But the Constitution still played a role in these suits if the federal officer attempted to respond by raising defenses that were available to him by virtue of his federal official status.58 For example, an officer might claim in defense that he was acting in his official capacity pursuant to a lawful order.59 But if his actions nonetheless violated the Constitution, the plaintiff could argue in reply that the officer\u2019s claimed authority to act violated the Constitution.60 That the officer relied on an official order in good faith was no defense; \u201cwhat mattered was legality.\u201d61 As the Supreme Court explained in the officer suit case of Mitchell v. Harmony,62 a person who executes an \u201corder to do an illegal act,\u201d such as one that violates the Constitution, has still committed an illegal act.63 In these contexts, the constitutional violation would effectively \u201cstrip\u201d the officer \u201cof his official character,\u201d rendering him liable in damages for his misconduct like any ordinary citizen.64 Many officers held liable under this scheme successfully turned to Congress, ultimately shifting the liability of judgment onto the public fisc.65 These principles would have done the same work in the context of officers who violated the Constitution acting pursuant to \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority.66 After all, an individual stripped of his official character would not have been able to invoke any official justification for his behavior, including that he was acting with latitude of discretion conferred to him under federal law. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Enforcing Unconstitutional Statutes.\u00a0\u2014 Another type of officer suit that commonly recurred at common law illustrates how the common law would have treated \u201cdiscretion\u201d as being constrained by constitutional limits. At common law, plaintiffs could bring damages suits against officers who carried out duties pursuant to unconstitutional statutes.67 And when they did so, even officers acting in a discretionary capacity were denied the ability to invoke the unconstitutional statute in defense to such claims.68 In such contexts, as the Supreme Court expounded in 1949, \u201cthe power has been conferred in form but the grant is lacking in substance because of its constitutional invalidity.\u201d69 Scores of precedents from state courts70 and the federal Supreme Court71 invoked this rule. It was rooted in a basic principle: if the government enacted a statute that was unconstitutional, the government exceeded its lawful powers, and the statute would not shield the officer who acted as the government\u2019s agent from suit.72 This practice accorded with the long-accepted premise that an unconstitutional statute is no law at all.73 The same principles would have applied had a statute conferred discretion on an official to act, and the official did so in a manner that contravened the Constitution. After all, a legislature that lacks the authority to directly authorize its agents to carry out unconstitutional acts likewise lacks the authority to do so indirectly. Consequently, a statute authorizing officers discretion to carry out certain acts could not have shielded those who committed unconstitutional acts in the exercise of that discretion from liability simply because the statute granted the officers latitude of judgment.74 The 1880 case of Gross v. Rice75 is illustrative of the point. Gross sued Rice, his prison warden, for damages for false imprisonment when Rice kept him imprisoned beyond his initial sentence.76 Rice responded by arguing that his actions were authorized by a statute allowing wardens to hold prisoners beyond their sentence by the amount of time they had spent in solitary confinement for contravening prison rules.77 The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine nonetheless found Rice liable because it held that the statute was unconstitutional.78 It empowered Rice to deprive Gross of his liberty \u201cwithout any new accusation, trial and sentence,\u201d thereby violating his right to due process of law.79 The court conceded that \u201cthe punishment of refractory convicts is a matter within the discretion of the warden.\u201d80 But as the court put it, \u201c[i]t does not follow that because a warden may inflict some punishment, he may inflict any.\u201d81 Rather, his \u201cdiscretion\u201d was subject to \u201climits,\u201d of which the Constitution was one.82 The court in Rice bolstered its reasoning by considering what would have occurred had the warden held Gross beyond his sentence without a statute authorizing him to do so.83 The court had little difficulty concluding the result would have been the same. The warden still would have \u201cdeprive[d] the prisoner of his liberty without any process of law and without any legal excuse or justification whatever.\u201d84 Because legislatures do not have the power to transform acts that would be unconstitutional into constitutional ones, the statute clearly could not shield the warden from liability by merely granting him \u201cdiscretion.\u201d Neither Rice nor its reasoning was an anomaly. As Professor Edwin Borchard summarized the existing law in 1924, \u201cthe Supreme Court has never hesitated to enjoin or otherwise control the instrument or agent of the State acting under an unconstitutional statute or, of course, acting unconstitutionally in the execution of a valid statute.\u201d85 By the end of the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court began developing immunity doctrines that broke with the common law\u2019s strict liability regime, as many scholars have documented.86 But even then, the Court did not abandon the fundamental principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d does not transcend constitutional limits, as exemplified by the two patterns of cases described above.87 This is why, for instance, the Supreme Court has reiterated that \u201c[o]f course, a prosecutor\u2019s discretion is \u2018subject to constitutional constraints.\u2019\u201d88 So when the FTCA was enacted, it codified \u201cdiscretion\u201d against a well-developed background principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d referred only to the \u201cdiscretion contemplated by law.\u201d89 II.\u00a0\u00a0The FTCA Upshot Whether the discretionary function exception applies to tortious conduct that is also a constitutional violation is one of many contested questions about the exception\u2019s meaning. The FTCA does not include a definition of the phrase \u201cdiscretionary function or duty.\u201d90 As a result, courts have long struggled to determine the exception\u2019s bounds.91 The Supreme Court\u2019s test for determining whether the exception applies offers little additional guidance.92 Under that test, if the conduct \u201cinvolves an element of judgment or choice\u201d \u201cgrounded in social, economic, and political policy\u201d considerations, the exception applies.93 But, as one treatise puts it, \u201cthe exact boundaries of the exception remain unclear.\u201d94 This Part argues that the common law helps to illuminate those boundaries, particularly those drawn by the Constitution. The common law often plays a \u201cgap-filling role in statutory interpretation.\u201d95 As Justice Thomas once explained, the Supreme Court \u201cpresume[s] that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law.\u201d96 So when a statute uses a \u201cterm[] of art\u201d that took on a particular meaning at common law,97 the Court often relies on the common law as \u201can authoritative external source of [the statute\u2019s] meaning,\u201d just as it would a dictionary or a semantic canon.98 The FTCA is particularly well-suited to this mode of construction. As the Supreme Court contended in 1962, \u201c[i]t is evident that the Act was not patterned to operate with complete independence from\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the common law.\u201d99\u00a0 Instead, the FTCA was devised to \u201cbuild upon the legal relationships formulated and characterized by the States.\u201d100 A.\u00a0\u00a0Incorporating Common Law \u201cDiscretion\u201d into the FTCA \u201cDiscretion,\u201d as understood and applied at common law, would have been a familiar concept to the FTCA-enacting Congress.101 In the de\u00adcades preceding the FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress evaluated thousands of private claims for indemnification based on tort judgments rendered against officers under the common law.102 When Congress enacted the FTCA to replace this scheme, its primary aim was to get the legislature out of the business of considering each damages claim individually.103 It was not to entirely restructure the substance of these suits\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something the Supreme Court has recognized since the FTCA\u2019s infancy.104 This is apparent from the way that claims under the Act piggyback off existing state tort regimes. As one treatise puts it, \u201cthe Act does not create new causes of action\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in the sense of inventing new types of torts.\u201d105 Rather, it simply waives sovereign immunity for tort claims available to plaintiffs suing a \u201cprivate person\u201d in the state where the act or omission occurred.106 The Supreme Court has described the Act as \u201cmerely substitut[ing] the District Courts for Congress as the agency to determine the validity and amount of the claims\u201d that were previously considered by private bills.107 Because the FTCA was written against this rich common law backdrop and \u201cdiscretion\u201d had a recognizable meaning at common law, early commentators concluded that Congress must have intentionally invoked the phrase to codify the common law doctrine of nonliability for officers exercising acts requiring discretion.108 The Supreme Court recognized the common law doctrine\u2019s relevance when it considered the exception for the first time in Dalehite v. United States.109 But the analogy did not catch hold. Struggling to define the exception\u2019s vague contours in practice, the Supreme Court began to craft various tests to liquidate the exception\u2019s meaning.110 The result is that modern discretionary function jurisprudence is rooted in a judicially constructed test that is largely disconnected from the original meaning of the statutory text.111 It is possible that the Court opted not to adopt the analogy this Note is propounding because many scholars and courts at the time were critical of the ministerial/discretionary model, in large part because they believed the dichotomy between the two was muddled.112 But those criticisms, however accurate they may be, should not be a barrier to using the analogy in this context. After all, the relevant question is whether Congress incorporated the common law definition of \u201cdiscretion\u201d into the FTCA at all, not whether the specific contours of the ministerial/discretionary distinction were well defined. And there is strong evidence Congress intended the analogy. As the Supreme Court noted in Dalehite, Congress added the exception later on in the drafting process \u201cas a clarifying amendment\u201d to ensure that courts adjudicating FTCA claims would continue to employ the common law doctrine governing liability for discretionary officials.113 The House Committee on the Judiciary was advised that, even without such clarification, \u201c[i]t [wa]s not probable that the courts would extend a [T]ort [C]laims [A]ct into the realm of the validity of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretionary administrative action,\u201d as then\u2013Assistant Attorney General Shea explained in a House hearing.114 Instead, the FTCA\u2019s drafters thought such cases would have been \u201cexempted\u201d already by \u201cjudicial construction.\u201d115 The bill was modified only to \u201cmake [this] explicit.\u201d116 To be sure, the entire purpose of the discretionary function exception is to demarcate a category of cases in which the FTCA\u2019s general waiver of the government\u2019s immunity from suit \u201cshall not apply.\u201d117 By contrast, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was used to determine an officer\u2019s immunity from suit. And at common law, the scope of an officer\u2019s immunity was not coterminous with the government\u2019s. When an individual officer exceeded his authority by offending the Constitution, he could be sued even though the government could not.118 Indeed, officer suits in these cases were in effect a means of getting around the sovereign immunity of the state.119 Sovereign immunity would not bar such a claim against the officer precisely because the officer\u2019s actions in such a situation were not \u201cattributed to the sovereign.\u201d120 Consequently, interpreting a waiver of sovereign immunity via an analogy to officer immunity may seem inapt. But the analogy has a strong doctrinal basis. First, recall that Congress enacted the FTCA to contend with the relationship between sovereign immunity and officer liability at common law, as this Part has described. Because the FTCA was designed to replace the pre-FTCA regime\u00a0\u2014\u00a0formally transferring the liability of government officers to the government itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it makes sense that Congress would draw on the mechanics of officer liability in crafting this regime. Second, consider that the rationales underlying official immunity are largely the same as those justifying sovereign immunity in the modern era. Courts and commentators have long rationalized official immunity as necessary to address two distinct but interrelated concerns. The first is that without immunity, public officers would be \u201cunduly hampered\u201d in the execution of their duties by the threat of liability,121 thus impeding the \u201ceffective administration of public affairs.\u201d122 The second is that without immunity, courts would be forced to scrutinize the propriety of policymaking decisions, thereby threatening separation of powers.123 Though sovereign immunity was originally introduced in the United States as a vestige of the English common law axiom \u201cthe King can do no wrong,\u201d124 it is sustained today on largely similar public policy grounds.125 Courts have long rationalized that without sovereign immunity, the government\u2019s focus and resources would be unduly tied up in litigation, jeopardizing its ability to effectively govern.126 Likewise, scholars have argued that sovereign immunity prevents the kind of judicial second-guessing of a coordinate branch\u2019s functions that undermines separation of powers.127 In light of these parallels, it makes sense to draw upon the common law principles of officer immunity to interpret a statute governing the government\u2019s immunity from suit. B.\u00a0\u00a0Operationalizing the FTCA\u2019s Common Law Backdrop If we accept the premise that the FTCA\u2019s text points us toward the common law of officer immunity as a window into the meaning of the discretionary function exception, where does that take us?128 The history articulated in Part I suggests we should reject Judge Easterbrook\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act.\u201d129 After all, if \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was understood to refer only to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d130 one cannot disregard \u201cconstitutional theories\u201d in determining the scope of the exception.131 Doing so would contravene the very text of the statute. Text-based arguments to the contrary fail upon closer inspection. First, courts have emphasized that the exception applies to all acts of discretion \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d132 And because an officer who acts unconstitutionally has abused their discretion, the argument goes, the exception applies to such conduct.133 Indeed, even the federal government has taken this position recently, embracing the litigating position that \u201capplication of the exception does not turn on whether the official has exercised the discretion in a permissible manner.\u201d134 It has marshaled some dicta from the Supreme Court in support of this view.135 But unconstitutional conduct does not \u201cabuse\u201d discretion; it exceeds discretion. As Part I describes, acts that violated the Constitution at common law were treated as acts taken outside the realm of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority. Acts that abuse discretion, by contrast, are merely errors in judgment, even if \u201cmonumental\u201d and of \u201cinexcusable proportions.\u201d136 This is so because discretion vests officers with the power to use their authority \u201caccording to [their] own view of what is necessary and proper,\u201d creating a zone that insulates officers who get that calculation wrong.137 Officers step outside that zone only by engaging in conduct that removes their discretion wholesale\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as acts that violate the Constitution. The second and third contentions can be grouped together because they rely on the same category error. The FTCA applies only to state tort claims for which a \u201cprivate person\u201d could be liable.138 That \u201c[t]he Constitution governs the conduct of public officials, not private ones\u201d seems to be in tension with this premise.139 Indeed, in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Meyer,140 the Supreme Court explicitly held that a \u201cconstitutional tort claim is not \u2018cognizable\u2019\u201d under the FTCA, relying largely on the \u201cprivate person\u201d language.141 Moreover, in 1988 Congress passed the Westfall Act, amending the FTCA to ensure it would not cover claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d142 But both the \u201cprivate person\u201d proviso and the Westfall Act limitation clarify the type of claim that can be brought under the FTCA. They say nothing about the types of arguments one can raise to defeat the government\u2019s invocation of the discretionary function exception in response to their claims.143 A tort claim \u201cbrought for\u201d tortious conduct is not \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution\u201d just because the tortious conduct also could have been pled as a constitutional violation.144 Rather, a tort claim is brought for a violation of rights secured by common law. In this context, then, the Constitution enters into the equation to serve not as a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim but only as a response to the government\u2019s attempt to rely on the exception to defeat that claim. III.\u00a0\u00a0Pleading the \u201cConstitutionally Permissible\u201d Interpretation If the Constitution is relevant to whether the discretionary function exception applies, what must a plaintiff plead to prevent the exception from defeating her claim?145 The federal government has recently taken the position that a constitutional violation might foreclose the exception, but only if the plaintiff could show that the officer violated \u201ca specific, clearly established constitutional directive.\u201d146 The government derives this rule from the doctrine of qualified immunity, the modern standard of officer immunity applicable to Bivens claims brought against federal officers and claims brought against state officers for violations of federal law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.147 Under that doctrine, an officer cannot be held liable for violating the Constitution unless the constitutional violation was \u201cclearly established.\u201d148 Constitutional violations are clearly established only when \u201cexisting precedent\u201d has placed the \u201cconstitutional question beyond debate.\u201d149 The upshot of that standard is that courts can decide an officer did violate the Constitution yet still not grant the plaintiff relief if the violation was not already articulated by existing case law at the time the officer acted.150 Ironically, the government justifies importing that standard into the discretionary function exception by arguing that \u201cthe common-law doctrine of official immunity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0formed the backdrop to the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception.\u201d151 Courts would be wrong to embrace the clearly established law standard in this context. Plenty of scholars152 and even some Justices153 have explained how the modern doctrine of qualified immunity masquerades as rooted in the common law of our early republic while being entirely inconsistent with the actual immunity regimes that predominated at common law. And as this Note has shown, officers performing \u201cdiscretionary functions\u201d at common law did not get judicial grace for tortious wrongs that violated the Constitution whenever the constitutional right was not already clearly established by law. Instead, the common law treated an officer who committed a constitutional violation despite having \u201cdiscretion\u201d as having acted beyond the limits of his discretion and thus relinquished his official status and defenses the moment he committed the unconstitutional act. That the officer acted in good faith, believing his actions were lawful, was no defense.154 A clearly established law requirement would also be inconsistent with how courts apply the discretionary function exception to conduct that violates federal statutes, regulations, or policies. Under modern Supreme Court precedent, \u201cif a \u2018federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action\u2019\u201d for an officer to adhere to, the exception is inapplicable.155 This makes sense. In such instances, the officer \u201chas no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d156 In other words, they lack discretion to act. But courts don\u2019t apply a clearly established law requirement when deciding whether a statute contains a specific directive that constrains an officer\u2019s authority. In fact, they are frequently forced to interpret federal statutes, policies, and regulations anew when contending with claims that the officer\u2019s conduct violated them.157 And they don\u2019t withhold relief if there is no \u201cexisting precedent\u201d from other courts considering the question and thus placing the issue \u201cbeyond debate\u201d like the clearly established law standard requires.158 Instead, they grant relief if they determine that the official conduct was prescribed by statute or regulation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether they are the first court to reach that conclusion or not. The same standard should apply equally to FTCA claims involving constitutional violations. To be sure, plaintiffs should not be able to render the exception inapplicable by merely pleading that the officer\u2019s conduct implicated abstract constitutional principles. After all, that would transform the exception from a \u201csteel\u201d shield to a \u201cpaper\u201d one, as one district court put it159\u00a0\u2014\u00a0taking an exception that has been rendered overly broad by courts and turning it into one that will be overly narrow. But existing doctrines can guard against that. The discretionary function exception is jurisdictional, so the burden is on plaintiffs to prove that it does not apply.160 This most commonly occurs at the motion to dismiss stage, when the government invokes the exception to argue that the court does not have jurisdiction over the complaint because the complained of conduct implicates a discretionary function or duty.161 To survive this motion, plaintiffs will need to be able to make a colorable claim that is \u201cplausible on its face\u201d that a constitutional violation occurred.162 Courts evaluating this argument will frequently look to existing case law and constitutional principles to determine whether such a claim is plausible.163 At least one court has argued that it \u201cwould make no sense whatsoever\u201d for the FTCA to require courts to engage in such a detailed analysis from the outset to determine whether the United States is subject to suit.164 But courts already do just that when determining whether the exception applies in any context.165 They routinely leaf through National Park Service manuals and site management plans, for instance, when plaintiffs bring tort claims for accidents that occurred at national parks, looking to determine whether Park Service policies vested park officials with broad discretion.166 Plus, district courts have long been tasked with assessing the merits of alleged constitutional violations at the pleadings stage in other contexts, such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 suits, when the government moves to dismiss by arguing qualified immunity applies.167 Properly interpreted, the FTCA demands no different. Conclusion Today, Bivens is a largely nonexistent form of relief. But the FTCA does not need to be interpreted in a way that nullifies its remedial potential as well. Congress meant something specific when it wrote the discretionary function exception into the Act. One just needs to know where to look to discern its meaning. The Supreme Court has long instructed that the FTCA was \u201cdesigned to build upon\u201d the common law that developed in the context of tort suits for officer wrongs.168 That common law backdrop serves as a critical guide to understanding the meaning of this enigmatic exception. Once one understands that \u201cdiscretion,\u201d properly constructed in light of its common law meaning, refers to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d the exact boundaries of the exception become clearer. Though the discretionary function exception has been interpreted to retain the government\u2019s immunity in a breathtaking swath of cases, the proper interpretation suggests its reach should not extend to a potentially large category of cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0those in which plaintiffs can successfully plead that a constitutional violation preserves the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear their FTCA case.

L. Rev. 654 Recovering the Lost Meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s \u201cDiscretionary Function Exception\u201d Volume 138 Issue 2 December 2024 See full issue Download See Footnotes Since 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act1 (FTCA) has waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for damages claims brought against the United States for the tortious conduct of its employees.2 This waiver has allowed those wronged by a federal officer to seek recovery through claims predicated on the common law tort of the state in which the wrong occurred.3 But that waiver is subject to a litany of exceptions.4 One is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02680(a), which retains the government\u2019s immunity for any claim based on an employee\u2019s performance or failure to perform \u201ca discretionary function or duty\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d5 The lower courts have interpreted this \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d capaciously, rendering it remarkably broad and applicable to innumerable acts.6 In large part because of this, when the government has invoked the exception at the motion to dismiss stage, it has succeeded in dismissing nearly seventy-five percent of claims.7 But notable disagreements persist concerning the exception\u2019s bounds. One such disagreement has resulted in a split amongst the courts of appeals. It concerns the interplay between the discretionary function exception and the U.S. Constitution. Does the exception immunize the government from tort claims that also constitute constitutional violations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even though the Constitution cannot form the basis of a plaintiff\u2019s FTCA tort claim?8 Or does the Constitution place bounds on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that the exception can immunize? For instance, imagine a case in which a U.S. Park Police Officer arrested a woman for organizing a large prayer service on National Park grounds.9 Her arrest was not legally authorized and thus could constitute false arrest under the common law. If she brought an FTCA claim against the United States alleging false arrest, the government would, in the ordinary course, move to dismiss on grounds that the discretionary function exception applies.10 But could she successfully oppose that motion by arguing that the arrest plausibly violated her First Amendment rights, so the exception cannot apply? That question has real ramifications. Many claims that could be pleaded as constitutional violations could also be pleaded as violations of state tort law.11 For instance, many Fourth Amendment violations overlap with torts such as battery and invasion of privacy.12 So plaintiffs alleging official federal misconduct can pursue two damages claims: (1) an FTCA claim against the federal government for the tort and (2) a claim against the officer in their personal capacity for the constitutional violation.13 But today, plaintiffs will have trouble succeeding on the latter claim\u00a0\u2014\u00a0commonly referred to as a Bivens action for the 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,14 which implied a private right to damages relief for constitutional violations.15 Over the last few decades, the Court has appreciably cut back the availability of Bivens remedies.16 Judicially created causes of action, in its eyes, impermissibly blur the constitutional lines between legislative and judicial power.17 With Bivens largely gutted, the FTCA provides virtually the only path to damages relief for individuals harmed by a federal officer\u2019s unconstitutional conduct. And whether that path is a feasible one turns on whether the discretionary function exception applies to unconstitutional conduct. For almost fifty years, nearly every court of appeals to consider the issue reached the same conclusion. The government could not invoke the discretionary function exception in response to an FTCA claim if the tort alleged also constituted a constitutional violation.18 These courts generally reasoned that \u201c[i]t is, of course, a tautology that a federal official cannot have discretion to behave unconstitutionally.\u201d19 This proposition was considered so \u201celementary\u201d that these courts adopted this stance with little justification or interpretation of the FTCA itself.20 But in 2019, some circuits began challenging this entrenched conclusion. With Judge Easterbrook writing for a majority, the Seventh Circuit declared: \u201c[T]he theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d21 The Eleventh Circuit followed, describing the dominant view as writing in an \u201cextra-textual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion\u2019\u201d into the statute.22 The Seventh and Eleventh Circuits largely rooted their arguments in the text. Section 2680(a) applies \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused,\u201d so the statute is \u201cunambiguous and categorical\u201d in its scope, they argued.23 It does not \u201ccarve[] out certain behavior,\u201d even unconstitutional behavior, from the exception.24 This makes sense, they said, because \u201cCongress did not create the FTCA to address constitutional violations at all but, rather, to address violations of state tort law.\u201d25 And Congress made that explicit when it amended the FTCA in 1988, clarifying its inapplicability to claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d26 That amendment, both courts argued, proved that FTCA claims must be considered \u201cwithout regard to constitutional theories.\u201d27 The resulting split has spurred myriad commentators to side with the majority view, but largely with defenses that double down on that view\u2019s original axiom\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that any other reading of the exception is simply incompatible with the Constitution.28 This Note offers a different tack that places the majority view on firmer footing. It argues that Congress transplanted the common law term \u201cdiscretion,\u201d which governed officer suits at common law, into the discretionary function exception. And it demonstrates how that exception, when properly interpreted against this common law backdrop, retains the government\u2019s immunity only for \u201cconstitutionally permissible\u201d discretionary functions.29 Part I explains the doctrine of \u201cdiscretion\u201d that governed officer suits at common law. This Part argues the predominant view at common law was that the Constitution placed boundaries on the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that could be conferred on officers. Part II discusses the upshot for interpreting the discretionary function exception. And it shows how interpreting \u201cdiscretion\u201d as referring to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion\u201d fits within the larger mechanics of the FTCA\u2019s scheme and Supreme Court doctrine implementing it. Part III concludes by discussing the implications of this interpretation for how plaintiffs looking to vindicate constitutional rights through tort suits under the FTCA should plead their FTCA claims. I.\u00a0\u00a0The Discretionary Function Exception\u2019s Common Law Backdrop When the FTCA was enacted in 1946, it did not emerge ex nihilo. Rather, it built upon a long tradition of official accountability rooted in tort law that prevailed since the early republic. Prior to the FTCA\u2019s passage, individuals could not receive damages directly from the United States for the tortious conduct of its officers.30 Sovereign immunity barred any suit for money damages brought directly against the United States.31 But it did not bar suit against the officers who committed the wrongs.32 Throughout the nineteenth century, individuals wronged by official misconduct sought redress against individual officers by suing them in tort.33 And if the officer was found liable, the officer could in turn seek indemnification from the government in the form of a private bill from Congress.34 In the era prior to the Civil War, about sixty percent of officers who sought indemnity received it.35 But by the early twentieth century, this practice had become arduous and distracting for Congress.36 And so in 1946, Congress enacted the FTCA to replace the antiquated scheme. Given this history, one cannot understand the modern regime without first grasping its common law foundations. This Part begins by examining the common law roots of \u201cdiscretion\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a doctrinal fixture in officer suits at common law that dictated the extent to which an individual executive official could be held liable for misconduct. It then draws upon examples of individual officer suits at common law to explain how the common law viewed the Constitution as imposing constraints on discretion. A.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDiscretion\u201d at Common Law As early as Marbury v. Madison,37 the Supreme Court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0apparently motivated by separation of powers concerns\u00a0\u2014\u00a0articulated the principle that courts should not \u201cenquire\u201d into how officers \u201cperform duties in which they have\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretion.\u201d38 By the mid-nineteenth century, courts captured this immunity principle through a distinction between \u201cministerial\u201d and \u201cdiscretionary\u201d functions.39 Officials had discretionary rather than ministerial duties when the law gave them the authority to use their own judgment to decide how to best carry out their obligations.40 Because this latitude of judgment was similar to that granted to judges,41 discretionary authority for executive officials was sometimes referred to as \u201cquasi-judicial.\u201d42 Courts used this distinction to determine the individual damages liability of an officer for carrying out his duties improperly.43 To be sure, the line between ministerial and discretionary functions was not always clear. Courts did not always agree about whether a particular duty constituted a ministerial or a discretionary one.44 For example, when the FTCA was enacted, state courts were divided over whether a warden\u2019s duty to preserve the health and safety of jails and their occupants was ministerial or discretionary in nature.45 And as the distinction developed throughout the early twentieth century, some criticized it as being largely indeterminate and unhelpful for deciding the proper scope of an officer\u2019s liability.46 Professor Louis Jaffe described it as \u201ca way of stating rather than arriving at the result,\u201d merely a \u201cconvenient device for extending the area of nonliability without making the reasons explicit.\u201d47 And Dean William Prosser\u2019s 1941 Handbook of the Law of Torts labeled it a \u201crather unworkable distinction.\u201d48 But regardless of the academic disdain for the distinction, it remained alive and well in the courts. Through the early twentieth century, courts consistently employed the distinction to determine whether an officer could be held liable in damages for his misdeeds.49 B.\u00a0\u00a0The Boundaries of Common Law Discretion Nonetheless, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was not a blank permission slip. As this Part describes, even if a court found that an officer was delegated \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority, it could still find the officer liable for his misdeeds. This is because a separate principle generally embraced at common law stated that \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers were shielded from liability only if they did not \u201cact wholly outside of their jurisdiction or official authority.\u201d50 As Professor James Pfander helpfully describes it, this \u201cdiscretion\u201d was a \u201czone.\u201d51 As long as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d officers operated within that zone, they \u201cwere free to exercise their best judgment without judicial oversight.\u201d52 But if a court determined that an officer \u201cact[ed] beyond his jurisdiction,\u201d as the Supreme Court put it in the 1849 case Wilkes v. Dinsman,53 that court would treat the officer \u201cas not acting in the capacity of an officer at all\u201d54 but rather as merely a private citizen, stripped of any official defenses from suit.55 How would a court determine when an officer had stepped outside these boundaries? One cannot and should not pretend that courts were always consistent. But the common law tended to embrace the principle that an officer could exceed these bounds by contravening the Constitution.56 That is, \u201cdiscretion,\u201d no matter how broadly conferred, could not dissolve constitutional limits. This Part explores the two types of paradigmatic common law cases that illustrate this principle. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Tortious Conduct.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0When an individual was harmed by official misconduct at common law, they \u201ccould normally seek redress by invoking forms of action available at common law and in equity that included suits against governmental officials under ordinary tort law.\u201d57 The claim was not pled as a constitutional violation. But the Constitution still played a role in these suits if the federal officer attempted to respond by raising defenses that were available to him by virtue of his federal official status.58 For example, an officer might claim in defense that he was acting in his official capacity pursuant to a lawful order.59 But if his actions nonetheless violated the Constitution, the plaintiff could argue in reply that the officer\u2019s claimed authority to act violated the Constitution.60 That the officer relied on an official order in good faith was no defense; \u201cwhat mattered was legality.\u201d61 As the Supreme Court explained in the officer suit case of Mitchell v. Harmony,62 a person who executes an \u201corder to do an illegal act,\u201d such as one that violates the Constitution, has still committed an illegal act.63 In these contexts, the constitutional violation would effectively \u201cstrip\u201d the officer \u201cof his official character,\u201d rendering him liable in damages for his misconduct like any ordinary citizen.64 Many officers held liable under this scheme successfully turned to Congress, ultimately shifting the liability of judgment onto the public fisc.65 These principles would have done the same work in the context of officers who violated the Constitution acting pursuant to \u201cdiscretionary\u201d authority.66 After all, an individual stripped of his official character would not have been able to invoke any official justification for his behavior, including that he was acting with latitude of discretion conferred to him under federal law. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Suits Against Officers for Enforcing Unconstitutional Statutes.\u00a0\u2014 Another type of officer suit that commonly recurred at common law illustrates how the common law would have treated \u201cdiscretion\u201d as being constrained by constitutional limits. At common law, plaintiffs could bring damages suits against officers who carried out duties pursuant to unconstitutional statutes.67 And when they did so, even officers acting in a discretionary capacity were denied the ability to invoke the unconstitutional statute in defense to such claims.68 In such contexts, as the Supreme Court expounded in 1949, \u201cthe power has been conferred in form but the grant is lacking in substance because of its constitutional invalidity.\u201d69 Scores of precedents from state courts70 and the federal Supreme Court71 invoked this rule. It was rooted in a basic principle: if the government enacted a statute that was unconstitutional, the government exceeded its lawful powers, and the statute would not shield the officer who acted as the government\u2019s agent from suit.72 This practice accorded with the long-accepted premise that an unconstitutional statute is no law at all.73 The same principles would have applied had a statute conferred discretion on an official to act, and the official did so in a manner that contravened the Constitution. After all, a legislature that lacks the authority to directly authorize its agents to carry out unconstitutional acts likewise lacks the authority to do so indirectly. Consequently, a statute authorizing officers discretion to carry out certain acts could not have shielded those who committed unconstitutional acts in the exercise of that discretion from liability simply because the statute granted the officers latitude of judgment.74 The 1880 case of Gross v. Rice75 is illustrative of the point. Gross sued Rice, his prison warden, for damages for false imprisonment when Rice kept him imprisoned beyond his initial sentence.76 Rice responded by arguing that his actions were authorized by a statute allowing wardens to hold prisoners beyond their sentence by the amount of time they had spent in solitary confinement for contravening prison rules.77 The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine nonetheless found Rice liable because it held that the statute was unconstitutional.78 It empowered Rice to deprive Gross of his liberty \u201cwithout any new accusation, trial and sentence,\u201d thereby violating his right to due process of law.79 The court conceded that \u201cthe punishment of refractory convicts is a matter within the discretion of the warden.\u201d80 But as the court put it, \u201c[i]t does not follow that because a warden may inflict some punishment, he may inflict any.\u201d81 Rather, his \u201cdiscretion\u201d was subject to \u201climits,\u201d of which the Constitution was one.82 The court in Rice bolstered its reasoning by considering what would have occurred had the warden held Gross beyond his sentence without a statute authorizing him to do so.83 The court had little difficulty concluding the result would have been the same. The warden still would have \u201cdeprive[d] the prisoner of his liberty without any process of law and without any legal excuse or justification whatever.\u201d84 Because legislatures do not have the power to transform acts that would be unconstitutional into constitutional ones, the statute clearly could not shield the warden from liability by merely granting him \u201cdiscretion.\u201d Neither Rice nor its reasoning was an anomaly. As Professor Edwin Borchard summarized the existing law in 1924, \u201cthe Supreme Court has never hesitated to enjoin or otherwise control the instrument or agent of the State acting under an unconstitutional statute or, of course, acting unconstitutionally in the execution of a valid statute.\u201d85 By the end of the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court began developing immunity doctrines that broke with the common law\u2019s strict liability regime, as many scholars have documented.86 But even then, the Court did not abandon the fundamental principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d does not transcend constitutional limits, as exemplified by the two patterns of cases described above.87 This is why, for instance, the Supreme Court has reiterated that \u201c[o]f course, a prosecutor\u2019s discretion is \u2018subject to constitutional constraints.\u2019\u201d88 So when the FTCA was enacted, it codified \u201cdiscretion\u201d against a well-developed background principle that \u201cdiscretion\u201d referred only to the \u201cdiscretion contemplated by law.\u201d89 II.\u00a0\u00a0The FTCA Upshot Whether the discretionary function exception applies to tortious conduct that is also a constitutional violation is one of many contested questions about the exception\u2019s meaning. The FTCA does not include a definition of the phrase \u201cdiscretionary function or duty.\u201d90 As a result, courts have long struggled to determine the exception\u2019s bounds.91 The Supreme Court\u2019s test for determining whether the exception applies offers little additional guidance.92 Under that test, if the conduct \u201cinvolves an element of judgment or choice\u201d \u201cgrounded in social, economic, and political policy\u201d considerations, the exception applies.93 But, as one treatise puts it, \u201cthe exact boundaries of the exception remain unclear.\u201d94 This Part argues that the common law helps to illuminate those boundaries, particularly those drawn by the Constitution. The common law often plays a \u201cgap-filling role in statutory interpretation.\u201d95 As Justice Thomas once explained, the Supreme Court \u201cpresume[s] that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law.\u201d96 So when a statute uses a \u201cterm[] of art\u201d that took on a particular meaning at common law,97 the Court often relies on the common law as \u201can authoritative external source of [the statute\u2019s] meaning,\u201d just as it would a dictionary or a semantic canon.98 The FTCA is particularly well-suited to this mode of construction. As the Supreme Court contended in 1962, \u201c[i]t is evident that the Act was not patterned to operate with complete independence from\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the common law.\u201d99\u00a0 Instead, the FTCA was devised to \u201cbuild upon the legal relationships formulated and characterized by the States.\u201d100 A.\u00a0\u00a0Incorporating Common Law \u201cDiscretion\u201d into the FTCA \u201cDiscretion,\u201d as understood and applied at common law, would have been a familiar concept to the FTCA-enacting Congress.101 In the de\u00adcades preceding the FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress evaluated thousands of private claims for indemnification based on tort judgments rendered against officers under the common law.102 When Congress enacted the FTCA to replace this scheme, its primary aim was to get the legislature out of the business of considering each damages claim individually.103 It was not to entirely restructure the substance of these suits\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something the Supreme Court has recognized since the FTCA\u2019s infancy.104 This is apparent from the way that claims under the Act piggyback off existing state tort regimes. As one treatise puts it, \u201cthe Act does not create new causes of action\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in the sense of inventing new types of torts.\u201d105 Rather, it simply waives sovereign immunity for tort claims available to plaintiffs suing a \u201cprivate person\u201d in the state where the act or omission occurred.106 The Supreme Court has described the Act as \u201cmerely substitut[ing] the District Courts for Congress as the agency to determine the validity and amount of the claims\u201d that were previously considered by private bills.107 Because the FTCA was written against this rich common law backdrop and \u201cdiscretion\u201d had a recognizable meaning at common law, early commentators concluded that Congress must have intentionally invoked the phrase to codify the common law doctrine of nonliability for officers exercising acts requiring discretion.108 The Supreme Court recognized the common law doctrine\u2019s relevance when it considered the exception for the first time in Dalehite v. United States.109 But the analogy did not catch hold. Struggling to define the exception\u2019s vague contours in practice, the Supreme Court began to craft various tests to liquidate the exception\u2019s meaning.110 The result is that modern discretionary function jurisprudence is rooted in a judicially constructed test that is largely disconnected from the original meaning of the statutory text.111 It is possible that the Court opted not to adopt the analogy this Note is propounding because many scholars and courts at the time were critical of the ministerial/discretionary model, in large part because they believed the dichotomy between the two was muddled.112 But those criticisms, however accurate they may be, should not be a barrier to using the analogy in this context. After all, the relevant question is whether Congress incorporated the common law definition of \u201cdiscretion\u201d into the FTCA at all, not whether the specific contours of the ministerial/discretionary distinction were well defined. And there is strong evidence Congress intended the analogy. As the Supreme Court noted in Dalehite, Congress added the exception later on in the drafting process \u201cas a clarifying amendment\u201d to ensure that courts adjudicating FTCA claims would continue to employ the common law doctrine governing liability for discretionary officials.113 The House Committee on the Judiciary was advised that, even without such clarification, \u201c[i]t [wa]s not probable that the courts would extend a [T]ort [C]laims [A]ct into the realm of the validity of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0discretionary administrative action,\u201d as then\u2013Assistant Attorney General Shea explained in a House hearing.114 Instead, the FTCA\u2019s drafters thought such cases would have been \u201cexempted\u201d already by \u201cjudicial construction.\u201d115 The bill was modified only to \u201cmake [this] explicit.\u201d116 To be sure, the entire purpose of the discretionary function exception is to demarcate a category of cases in which the FTCA\u2019s general waiver of the government\u2019s immunity from suit \u201cshall not apply.\u201d117 By contrast, \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was used to determine an officer\u2019s immunity from suit. And at common law, the scope of an officer\u2019s immunity was not coterminous with the government\u2019s. When an individual officer exceeded his authority by offending the Constitution, he could be sued even though the government could not.118 Indeed, officer suits in these cases were in effect a means of getting around the sovereign immunity of the state.119 Sovereign immunity would not bar such a claim against the officer precisely because the officer\u2019s actions in such a situation were not \u201cattributed to the sovereign.\u201d120 Consequently, interpreting a waiver of sovereign immunity via an analogy to officer immunity may seem inapt. But the analogy has a strong doctrinal basis. First, recall that Congress enacted the FTCA to contend with the relationship between sovereign immunity and officer liability at common law, as this Part has described. Because the FTCA was designed to replace the pre-FTCA regime\u00a0\u2014\u00a0formally transferring the liability of government officers to the government itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it makes sense that Congress would draw on the mechanics of officer liability in crafting this regime. Second, consider that the rationales underlying official immunity are largely the same as those justifying sovereign immunity in the modern era. Courts and commentators have long rationalized official immunity as necessary to address two distinct but interrelated concerns. The first is that without immunity, public officers would be \u201cunduly hampered\u201d in the execution of their duties by the threat of liability,121 thus impeding the \u201ceffective administration of public affairs.\u201d122 The second is that without immunity, courts would be forced to scrutinize the propriety of policymaking decisions, thereby threatening separation of powers.123 Though sovereign immunity was originally introduced in the United States as a vestige of the English common law axiom \u201cthe King can do no wrong,\u201d124 it is sustained today on largely similar public policy grounds.125 Courts have long rationalized that without sovereign immunity, the government\u2019s focus and resources would be unduly tied up in litigation, jeopardizing its ability to effectively govern.126 Likewise, scholars have argued that sovereign immunity prevents the kind of judicial second-guessing of a coordinate branch\u2019s functions that undermines separation of powers.127 In light of these parallels, it makes sense to draw upon the common law principles of officer immunity to interpret a statute governing the government\u2019s immunity from suit. B.\u00a0\u00a0Operationalizing the FTCA\u2019s Common Law Backdrop If we accept the premise that the FTCA\u2019s text points us toward the common law of officer immunity as a window into the meaning of the discretionary function exception, where does that take us?128 The history articulated in Part I suggests we should reject Judge Easterbrook\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe theme that \u2018no one has discretion to violate the Constitution\u2019 has nothing to do with the Federal Tort Claims Act.\u201d129 After all, if \u201cdiscretion\u201d at common law was understood to refer only to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d130 one cannot disregard \u201cconstitutional theories\u201d in determining the scope of the exception.131 Doing so would contravene the very text of the statute. Text-based arguments to the contrary fail upon closer inspection. First, courts have emphasized that the exception applies to all acts of discretion \u201cwhether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d132 And because an officer who acts unconstitutionally has abused their discretion, the argument goes, the exception applies to such conduct.133 Indeed, even the federal government has taken this position recently, embracing the litigating position that \u201capplication of the exception does not turn on whether the official has exercised the discretion in a permissible manner.\u201d134 It has marshaled some dicta from the Supreme Court in support of this view.135 But unconstitutional conduct does not \u201cabuse\u201d discretion; it exceeds discretion. As Part I describes, acts that violated the Constitution at common law were treated as acts taken outside the realm of the officer\u2019s discretionary authority. Acts that abuse discretion, by contrast, are merely errors in judgment, even if \u201cmonumental\u201d and of \u201cinexcusable proportions.\u201d136 This is so because discretion vests officers with the power to use their authority \u201caccording to [their] own view of what is necessary and proper,\u201d creating a zone that insulates officers who get that calculation wrong.137 Officers step outside that zone only by engaging in conduct that removes their discretion wholesale\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as acts that violate the Constitution. The second and third contentions can be grouped together because they rely on the same category error. The FTCA applies only to state tort claims for which a \u201cprivate person\u201d could be liable.138 That \u201c[t]he Constitution governs the conduct of public officials, not private ones\u201d seems to be in tension with this premise.139 Indeed, in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Meyer,140 the Supreme Court explicitly held that a \u201cconstitutional tort claim is not \u2018cognizable\u2019\u201d under the FTCA, relying largely on the \u201cprivate person\u201d language.141 Moreover, in 1988 Congress passed the Westfall Act, amending the FTCA to ensure it would not cover claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution.\u201d142 But both the \u201cprivate person\u201d proviso and the Westfall Act limitation clarify the type of claim that can be brought under the FTCA. They say nothing about the types of arguments one can raise to defeat the government\u2019s invocation of the discretionary function exception in response to their claims.143 A tort claim \u201cbrought for\u201d tortious conduct is not \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution\u201d just because the tortious conduct also could have been pled as a constitutional violation.144 Rather, a tort claim is brought for a violation of rights secured by common law. In this context, then, the Constitution enters into the equation to serve not as a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim but only as a response to the government\u2019s attempt to rely on the exception to defeat that claim. III.\u00a0\u00a0Pleading the \u201cConstitutionally Permissible\u201d Interpretation If the Constitution is relevant to whether the discretionary function exception applies, what must a plaintiff plead to prevent the exception from defeating her claim?145 The federal government has recently taken the position that a constitutional violation might foreclose the exception, but only if the plaintiff could show that the officer violated \u201ca specific, clearly established constitutional directive.\u201d146 The government derives this rule from the doctrine of qualified immunity, the modern standard of officer immunity applicable to Bivens claims brought against federal officers and claims brought against state officers for violations of federal law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.147 Under that doctrine, an officer cannot be held liable for violating the Constitution unless the constitutional violation was \u201cclearly established.\u201d148 Constitutional violations are clearly established only when \u201cexisting precedent\u201d has placed the \u201cconstitutional question beyond debate.\u201d149 The upshot of that standard is that courts can decide an officer did violate the Constitution yet still not grant the plaintiff relief if the violation was not already articulated by existing case law at the time the officer acted.150 Ironically, the government justifies importing that standard into the discretionary function exception by arguing that \u201cthe common-law doctrine of official immunity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0formed the backdrop to the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception.\u201d151 Courts would be wrong to embrace the clearly established law standard in this context. Plenty of scholars152 and even some Justices153 have explained how the modern doctrine of qualified immunity masquerades as rooted in the common law of our early republic while being entirely inconsistent with the actual immunity regimes that predominated at common law. And as this Note has shown, officers performing \u201cdiscretionary functions\u201d at common law did not get judicial grace for tortious wrongs that violated the Constitution whenever the constitutional right was not already clearly established by law. Instead, the common law treated an officer who committed a constitutional violation despite having \u201cdiscretion\u201d as having acted beyond the limits of his discretion and thus relinquished his official status and defenses the moment he committed the unconstitutional act. That the officer acted in good faith, believing his actions were lawful, was no defense.154 A clearly established law requirement would also be inconsistent with how courts apply the discretionary function exception to conduct that violates federal statutes, regulations, or policies. Under modern Supreme Court precedent, \u201cif a \u2018federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action\u2019\u201d for an officer to adhere to, the exception is inapplicable.155 This makes sense. In such instances, the officer \u201chas no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d156 In other words, they lack discretion to act. But courts don\u2019t apply a clearly established law requirement when deciding whether a statute contains a specific directive that constrains an officer\u2019s authority. In fact, they are frequently forced to interpret federal statutes, policies, and regulations anew when contending with claims that the officer\u2019s conduct violated them.157 And they don\u2019t withhold relief if there is no \u201cexisting precedent\u201d from other courts considering the question and thus placing the issue \u201cbeyond debate\u201d like the clearly established law standard requires.158 Instead, they grant relief if they determine that the official conduct was prescribed by statute or regulation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether they are the first court to reach that conclusion or not. The same standard should apply equally to FTCA claims involving constitutional violations. To be sure, plaintiffs should not be able to render the exception inapplicable by merely pleading that the officer\u2019s conduct implicated abstract constitutional principles. After all, that would transform the exception from a \u201csteel\u201d shield to a \u201cpaper\u201d one, as one district court put it159\u00a0\u2014\u00a0taking an exception that has been rendered overly broad by courts and turning it into one that will be overly narrow. But existing doctrines can guard against that. The discretionary function exception is jurisdictional, so the burden is on plaintiffs to prove that it does not apply.160 This most commonly occurs at the motion to dismiss stage, when the government invokes the exception to argue that the court does not have jurisdiction over the complaint because the complained of conduct implicates a discretionary function or duty.161 To survive this motion, plaintiffs will need to be able to make a colorable claim that is \u201cplausible on its face\u201d that a constitutional violation occurred.162 Courts evaluating this argument will frequently look to existing case law and constitutional principles to determine whether such a claim is plausible.163 At least one court has argued that it \u201cwould make no sense whatsoever\u201d for the FTCA to require courts to engage in such a detailed analysis from the outset to determine whether the United States is subject to suit.164 But courts already do just that when determining whether the exception applies in any context.165 They routinely leaf through National Park Service manuals and site management plans, for instance, when plaintiffs bring tort claims for accidents that occurred at national parks, looking to determine whether Park Service policies vested park officials with broad discretion.166 Plus, district courts have long been tasked with assessing the merits of alleged constitutional violations at the pleadings stage in other contexts, such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 suits, when the government moves to dismiss by arguing qualified immunity applies.167 Properly interpreted, the FTCA demands no different. Conclusion Today, Bivens is a largely nonexistent form of relief. But the FTCA does not need to be interpreted in a way that nullifies its remedial potential as well. Congress meant something specific when it wrote the discretionary function exception into the Act. One just needs to know where to look to discern its meaning. The Supreme Court has long instructed that the FTCA was \u201cdesigned to build upon\u201d the common law that developed in the context of tort suits for officer wrongs.168 That common law backdrop serves as a critical guide to understanding the meaning of this enigmatic exception. Once one understands that \u201cdiscretion,\u201d properly constructed in light of its common law meaning, refers to \u201cconstitutionally permissible discretion,\u201d the exact boundaries of the exception become clearer. Though the discretionary function exception has been interpreted to retain the government\u2019s immunity in a breathtaking swath of cases, the proper interpretation suggests its reach should not extend to a potentially large category of cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0those in which plaintiffs can successfully plead that a constitutional violation preserves the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear their FTCA case.

          "task_beliefs": "The new observation is the United States' \"Brief for the Respondents in Opposition\" (BIO), filed by the Solicitor General at the certiorari stage. This is not the full merits brief I was anticipating, but it is a highly valuable signal, as it provides the government's initial legal strategy and its reasons for why the Supreme Court should not have taken the case. My beliefs are updated with the government's preliminary counterarguments.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The government's BIO recounts the facts of the mistaken raid. While it frames them to emphasize the difficulty of the operation (e.g., \"complete darkness,\" \"rapidly-changing and dangerous situation\"), it does not dispute the core sequence of events. The factual basis for the case remains stable and uncontested.\n\n2.  **Question 1: Supremacy Clause (Belief Upgraded to Virtually Certain Reversal):** My prior belief that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding would be reversed is now significantly stronger. The government's BIO **does not defend the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning**. Instead, it argues that while the lower court's reasoning \"differs from the approach of other circuits,\" the *outcome* was correct for other reasons, and thus review was not warranted. This is a tacit concession that the Supremacy Clause holding is legally indefensible on the merits. The government has effectively folded on this question, making a reversal on this point a near certainty. The Court's decision here will likely be a simple procedural correction.\n\n3.  **Question 2: FTCA Exceptions (Belief Updated with Government's Counterargument):** The BIO provides the first look at the government's defense against the petitioners' interpretation of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). This is the crucial update.\n    *   **Government's Core Argument:** The government's strategy is to separate the *planning* of the raid from its *execution*. It argues that the discretionary function exception (DFE, \u00a7 2680(a)) bars any claims based on the agents' *preparatory* conduct. The BIO states that Agent Guerra's decisions on how to prepare, investigate the location, and navigate to the target were discretionary acts \"susceptible to policy analysis\" (weighing secrecy, urgency, and resources).\n    *   **The Central Conflict Defined:** The government implicitly argues that the DFE's protection of discretionary planning is not erased by the Law Enforcement Proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). The government's position is that the petitioners' claims, while styled as intentional torts (assault, false imprisonment), are fundamentally rooted in alleged negligence during the planning phase. Because this planning phase is protected by the DFE, the entire claim is barred. This directly counters the petitioners' powerful textual argument that the Proviso makes the DFE \"categorically inapplicable\" to the listed torts.\n    *   **Legal Battle Lines:** The dispute is now clear. Petitioners argue for a bright-line textual rule: if the claim is for a tort listed in \u00a7 2680(h) and committed by a law enforcement officer, the DFE simply does not apply. The government argues for a more nuanced, causation-based approach: if the tort listed in \u00a7 2680(h) was caused by an action protected by the DFE, the DFE still controls and bars the suit.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals & Scenario Analysis (Probabilities Refined):**\n    *   **Full Reversal (High Probability, but Conflict is Sharper):** This remains the most likely outcome. The petitioners' textual argument is clean, resolves a circuit split, and aligns with canons of statutory interpretation (specific over general). The government's argument is more complex and requires the Court to look behind the tort itself to analyze the causal chain, which it may be reluctant to do. A full reversal offers a clearer, more administrable rule.\n    *   **Reverse and Affirm (Probability Increased):** The probability of this outcome has increased from \"lower\" to a \"significant minority possibility.\" The government has articulated a plausible, policy-driven argument that the Court could adopt if it is concerned about opening the door to \"judicial second-guessing\" of law enforcement's tactical planning. The Court would reverse on the indefensible Supremacy Clause ground but then affirm the dismissal by adopting the government's DFE analysis.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Refined):** The BIO has provided the government's opening salvo. The most critical evidence needed to refine my prediction is now the **Respondent's (U.S. Government's) full Merits Brief**. This will show how they flesh out the arguments previewed in the BIO. Following that, the **Petitioners' Reply Brief** will be essential to see how they rebut the government's now-disclosed legal theory. The core legal clash is now defined, and the merits briefing will reveal the depth and persuasiveness of each side's position.",

This observation is dispositive; it is the ground truth that resolves the predictive task. All prior beliefs based on signals like briefs are now superseded by the Court's actual holding and reasoning. My beliefs are updated to reflect absolute certainty about the outcome.\n\n1.  **Factual Record (Stable):** The factual basis of the case\u2014the mistaken FBI raid on the Martin family home\u2014remains stable and is recited by the Court in its opinion as the undisputed predicate for its legal analysis.\n\n2.  **Question 1: Supremacy Clause (Belief Confirmed; Certainty Reached):** My prior belief that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding would be reversed is now confirmed as fact. The Court unanimously and unequivocally held that the Supremacy Clause does not afford the United States a special defense in FTCA suits.\n    *   **Court's Reasoning:** The Court's logic, as I now know, is that the FTCA is itself the \"supreme\" federal law governing the United States' tort liability. Because the FTCA generally incorporates state law as the standard of liability, there is no conflict between federal and state law for the Supremacy Clause to resolve. The Court explicitly rejected the Eleventh Circuit's reliance on *In re Neagle*, distinguishing it as a 19th-century case about a federal officer's immunity from *state criminal prosecution*, which is irrelevant to the federal government's civil liability under a statute that expressly subjects it to the same rules as a \"private individual.\"\n\n3.  **Question 2: FTCA Exceptions (Belief Resolved; Certainty Reached):** The central conflict regarding the interaction between the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) and the discretionary function exception (DFE, \u00a7 2680(a)) has been definitively resolved by the Court, though in a manner that splits the difference between the parties' positions and my prior scenarios.\n    *   **The Court's Holding on the Proviso's Scope:** The Court held that the law enforcement proviso in \u00a7 2680(h) overrides *only* the intentional-tort exception found within that same subsection. It does **not** override the DFE in \u00a7 2680(a) or any other exception in the statute. This holding rejects the Eleventh Circuit's unique, plaintiff-friendly view that the proviso negates all other exceptions.\n    *   **Rejection of My \"Full Reversal\" Scenario:** My highest-probability scenario was a \"full reversal\" where the Court would adopt the petitioners' argument that the proviso makes the DFE \"categorically inapplicable\" to the listed torts. The Court explicitly rejected this broad interpretation. Instead, it adopted the government's narrower reading of the proviso's scope, based on what the Court found to be clear textual and structural evidence (the proviso's placement within subsection (h), its shared subject matter, and the limited scope of its definitional clause).\n    *   **The Unresolved Question (Remanded):** Critically, while the Court settled the scope of the proviso, it deliberately **did not** decide the ultimate question of whether the DFE bars the petitioners' claims in this case. It did not adopt the government's full argument that the DFE *does* bar the suit because the tort was caused by protected planning decisions. The opinion states that the question of \"whether and under what circumstances the discretionary-function exception may ever foreclose a suit like this one lie well beyond the two questions the Court granted certiorari to address.\" The Court remanded for the Eleventh Circuit to perform this analysis in the first instance.\n\n4.  **Final Outcome & Predictive Certainty (Certainty Reached):** The prediction task is complete. The Court's final judgment is to **Vacate and Remand**.\n    *   The Eleventh Circuit's judgment is vacated in its entirety.\n    *   The case is sent back to the Eleventh Circuit with two clear legal rulings: (1) The Supremacy Clause is not a defense, and (2) the law enforcement proviso does not cancel out the discretionary function exception.\n    *   The core legal battle I previously identified\u2014whether discretionary *planning* is shielded by the DFE even when it leads to tortious *execution*\u2014is now the central issue to be decided by the Eleventh Circuit on remand.\n\n5.  **Critical Missing Evidence (Resolved):** All previous uncertainty is resolved. The final opinion is the terminal piece of evidence for this task. The existence of a concurrence from Justices Sotomayor and Jackson underscores that while the Court was unanimous in its judgment, there may be differing views on how the DFE analysis should proceed on remand, but this does not alter the definitive holdings on the questions presented.",
