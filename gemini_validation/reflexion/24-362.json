      "Does the Supremacy Clause prevent individuals from suing the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act when federal employees\u2019 actions, even if negligent or wrongful, are related to carrying out federal policy and can be interpreted as following federal laws?",
      "Is the discretionary-function exception, which usually protects the government from being sued for certain decisions made by its employees, always inapplicable when dealing with claims related to law enforcement officers\u2019 actions that fall under the intentional torts category?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In October 2017, six FBI agents, led by Special Agent Lawrence Guerra, mistakenly executed a no-knock search warrant at the home of Curtrina Martin and her family in Atlanta, Georgia. The intended target was a nearby home suspected to contain violent gang member Joseph Riley. Due to similarities between the two properties and issues with navigating to the correct address, the agents entered Martin\u2019s home instead. The SWAT team, in full tactical gear, entered the house, causing fear and distress to its occupants. They later realized the mistake and promptly left the scene, later apologizing and assuring the family that the FBI would handle any damages.\n\nMartin and her family sued the U.S. government and the agents, claiming violations of their Fourth Amendment rights and seeking damages under Georgia state law. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the decision, ruling that the agents were entitled to qualified immunity and that the Federal Tort Claims Act claims were barred by the Supremacy Clause and the discretionary function exception.",

By deciding to start with the Petition for Certiorari, the agent is targeting the single most important document for understanding the petitioner's arguments, the alleged circuit splits, and the reasons the Court might grant review. This significantly clarifies the path to a correct prediction for this specific case, even before any data is retrieved.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because the articulated strategy\u2014'start with the petition to understand the petitioner's core arguments'\u2014is a fundamental and generalizable principle for SCOTUS case prediction. Codifying and justifying this approach refines the agent's overall methodology, making it more effective for future, unrelated cases. \n\nThe joint EIG is very high because this action represents a perfect synthesis of task-specific planning and general strategic learning.

Analyzing this document is a critical, non-negotiable step to move beyond the high-level summary and understand the core legal substance of the case from the petitioner's perspective. Without it, a reasoned prediction is impossible.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because this action represents a fundamental and universally applicable strategy for SCOTUS case analysis: start by reading the petition. While not a novel technique, confirming the high value of this foundational step is crucial for building a robust and reliable prediction methodology.

Rep. No. 93-588 (1973) .............................................. 4, 11 \n \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREPLY ARGUMENT \nThe government agrees that the circuits are split \nover both questions presented: \nQP 1: \u201cPetitioners correctly observe that the [Elev-\nenth Circuit]\u2019s reasoning for rejecting [claims \nunder the Supremacy Clause] differs from the \napproach of other circuits[.]\u201d BIO 8. \nQP 2:  \u201cAs petitioners acknowledge  * * *  , every \ncourt of appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014to consider the issue has held that the \ndiscretionary function exception applies to \ntort claims listed in the law enforcement pro-\nviso[.]\u201d E.g., BIO 19. \nAnd the government does not dispute their importance. \nOn the contrary, it insists (BIO 22) that resolving the \nlatter split is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d  \nEven though the government agrees that the Elev-\nenth Circuit is wrong about both the Supremacy Clause \n(BIO 20\u201321) and the discretionary-function exception \n(BIO 13\u201320), it urges this Court to leave the splits in \nplace. In its view, this case is a bad vehicle because: (1) \ncircuits other than the Eleventh Circuit apply the dis-\ncretionary-function exception to law-enforcement pro-\nviso claims; (2) the exception, as interpreted by the gov-\nernment, is expansive enough to snuff out nearly all pro-\nviso claims; and, based on this interpretation, (3) \u201cno \ncourt of appeals  * * *  would have reached a different \nresult\u201d than the Eleventh Circuit did below. BIO 8.  \nThere are two problems with this vehicle argument. \nFirst, it hinges on a circuit split\u2014one that caused the \n\n2 \n \n \nEleventh Circuit to create the Supremacy Clause bar \nand that, according to the government (BIO 22), the \nCourt must resolve to properly construe the FTCA. Sec-\nond, no court of appeals has adopted the government\u2019s \nall-encompassing interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. Many, however, have rejected it.  \nBecause FBI Special Agent Lawrence Guerra\u2019s ac-\ntions were unconstitutional, careless, and unmoored \nfrom actual policy (Pet. 23\u201334), Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded under one theory or another in eight cir-\ncuits. And were it not for the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s unique \nSupremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims \nwould have proceeded below. Pet. App. 17a\u201319a, Martin \nv. United States, 2024 WL 1716235, at *6\u20138 (11th Cir. \nApr. 22, 2024). \nRather than mark this case as a bad vehicle, the BIO \nmerely offers the government\u2019s merits arguments about \nhow the Court should resolve the splits. As a result, the \nBIO complements the petition at the certiorari stage: \nBoth agree that the Eleventh Circuit is on the wrong \nside of important circuit splits, and both show that this \nCourt\u2019s intervention is necessary. Granting certiorari \nwill not only allow the Court to resolve the splits, but \nalso to address the apparent problem of unaccountable \nwrong-house raids in this country. See also Jimerson v. \nLewis, petition for cert. pending, No. 24-473 (1983 claims \nbarred by qualified immunity).  \n\n3 \n \n \nI. \nBut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims under the law-enforcement proviso \nwould have proceeded. \nAs we have explained (Pet. 25\u201328), Congress enacted \nthe FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso in response to a \npair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illinois, \njust like the raid here. See also Members of Congress \nAmici Br. 4\u201313 (e.g., observing that this case \u201caris[es] \nunder the precise circumstances that motivated Con-\ngress to enact the law-enforcement proviso\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). But the Eleventh Circuit held that the FTCA \nviolates the Supremacy Clause in this case. Pet. App. \n16a\u201319a. \nWhile the government agrees that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s application of the Supremacy Clause to the FTCA \nis wrong (BIO 20\u201321), it argues that any error is harm-\nless. This is incorrect. Under Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims would have proceeded \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, which effectively \nholds that large swaths of the FTCA are unconstitu-\ntional. This holding, alone, merits the Court\u2019s review. \n1. In the Eleventh Circuit, Congress\u2019s waiver of sov-\nereign immunity violates the Supremacy Clause when-\never it applies to acts of federal employees that \u201chave \nsome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d (for instance, \nif officers act \u201cwithin their discretionary authority\u201d) \n\u201cand can reasonably be characterized as complying with \nthe full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nKordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022), and citing Denson v. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, \n1348 (11th Cir. 2009)). Although the government agrees \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA claims, \n\n4 \n \n \nit nonetheless contends (BIO 20) that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cpremise is sound.\u201d It is not.  \nBorrowing from its BIO in Denson, BIO at 25, Den-\nson v. United States, 560 U.S. 952 (2010) (mem.), the \ngovernment argues here (BIO 20) that \u201cCongress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.\u201d But the government overlooks that in this case, \nunlike in Denson, the district court rejected the govern-\nment\u2019s assertion of state-law privilege to extinguish Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 proviso claims. Compare Pet. App. 63a\u201365a, \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1299\u20131300 \n(N.D. Ga. 2022) (rejecting Georgia-law privilege argu-\nments), with Denson v. United States, 2005 WL \n8160747, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 9, 2005) (accepting Flor-\nida-law privilege arguments). Only after the district \ncourt rejected the government\u2019s privilege argument did \nit move for reconsideration here, raising the Supremacy \nClause bar for the first time. Pet. App. 22a\u201323a, Martin \nv. United States, 2022 WL 18263039, at *1 (N.D. Ga. \nDec. 30, 2022). So even if Congress somehow intended to \nexclude law-enforcement-privileged acts from the \nFTCA, but see 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (accepting \u201cprivate \nperson\u201d liability); 28 U.S.C. 2680(h); S. Rep. No. 93-588 \n(1973), Guerra\u2019s acts were not privileged. The only thing \nstanding between Petitioners and their ability to pro-\nceed on their proviso claims in the Eleventh Circuit is \nthe Supremacy Clause bar. \n2. Whatever interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception ultimately emerges from the multiple \ncircuit splits, two things are clear: This case invokes the \n\n5 \n \n \ncause of action Congress created through the FTCA, \nand the Eleventh Circuit has held that cause of action \nunconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. \nThis Court\u2019s review is needed because the Eleventh \nCircuit has imposed a constraint on Congress\u2019s power to \nwaive sovereign immunity\u2014a constitutional issue of \n\u201cobvious importance.\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 9 \n(2005). As the Members of Congress note (Br. 20), the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s application of this constraint \u201ceffec-\ntively declared the FTCA unconstitutional in its core ap-\nplications.\u201d This Court regularly grants review when a \nlower court \u201cexercise[s]  * * *  the grave power of annul-\nling an Act of Congress.\u201d United States v. Gainey, 380 \nU.S. 63, 65 (1965); see, e.g., United States v. Bajakajian, \n524 U.S. 321, 327 (1998) (\u201cBecause the Court of Appeals\u2019 \nholding  * * *  invalidated a portion of an Act of Con-\ngress, we granted certiorari.\u201d).  \nThe Supremacy Clause bar is independently worthy \nof this Court\u2019s review, if not summary reversal. \nII. \nThe discretionary-function exception would not \nhave barred Petitioners\u2019 claims in most other \ncircuits.  \nThe government further argues (BIO 8) that, even if \nthe Eleventh Circuit had not invoked the Supremacy \nClause and had not excluded the proviso claims from the \ndiscretionary-function exception\u2014that is to say, if the \nlaw of the Eleventh Circuit were the opposite of what it \nis\u2014the errors in this case would be harmless. That\u2019s be-\ncause, in the government\u2019s view, Petitioners\u2019 claims oth-\nerwise fall under the discretionary-function exception.  \n\n6 \n \n \nThis is incorrect under any of the four splits we have \nidentified (Pet. 23\u201334). Just as Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims would have proceeded in the Eleventh Circuit \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded under the varying interpreta-\ntions of the discretionary-function exception in most \nother circuits. \n1. Unconstitutional Conduct. Because the wrong-\nhouse raid was unconstitutional, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded in seven circuits. Pet. 31\u201333. The \nThird Circuit recently explained, \u201cwe\u2014and nearly \nevery other circuit to have considered the issue\u2014have \nheld that \u2018conduct cannot be discretionary if it violates \nthe Constitution[.]\u2019\u201d Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 838 (3d \nCir. 2023). But the Eleventh and Seventh Circuits hold \nthat the Constitution imposes no limits on an officer\u2019s \ndiscretionary acts. See Pet. 32 & n.13. \nThe government does not dispute this split. In fact, \nit agrees with Petitioners\u2014but not the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014that the Constitution can curb discretion. It nev-\nertheless argues (BIO 12\u201313) that this case does not im-\nplicate the split because the Eleventh Circuit held that \nGuerra did not violate the Fourth Amendment. And \neven if he did, the government asserts, only clearly es-\ntablished constitutional principles can limit discretion \nunder the FTCA. \nThe government is wrong on the first point (a vehicle \nargument), and no circuit has ever adopted its position \non the second (a merits argument), though two have ex-\nplicitly rejected it. \nFirst, the Eleventh Circuit did not reach the merits \nof Petitioners\u2019 Fourth Amendment claims. The govern-\n\n7 \n \n \nment cherry-picks several quotes to suggest otherwise, \nclaiming that the panel \u201cheld that \u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d BIO 13 (quoting \nPet. App. 19a), and \u201c\u2018constitute[d] the kind of reasonable \nmistakes that the Fourth Amendment contemplates,\u2019\u201d \nibid. (quoting Pet. App. 14a). It also contends that the \npanel \u201cconsidered as part of its Supremacy Clause anal-\nysis whether Guerra \u2018complied with the full range of the \nFourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 13 n.2 (quoting Pet. App. \n19a).  \nBut the government omits language from the opinion \nbelow that expressly forecloses its interpretation. In the \nBivens section of the opinion, the panel clarified that \n\u201cthe sole issue for our resolution is whether [Guerra\u2019s] \nactions violated clearly established law.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe panel\u2019s constitutional discussion flows from this \npremise. Accordingly, the panel concluded\u2014after ad-\ndressing Guerra\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe law \nat the time did not clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s pre-\nparatory steps before the warrant execution would vio-\nlate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 14a\u201315a. Further, \nthe full-range-of-the-Fourth-Amendment quote comes \nfrom the panel\u2019s Supremacy Clause analysis, where the \npanel explained that the supremacy question involved \n\u201cthe same inquiry as the inquiry we employed in the \nqualified immunity analysis\u201d\u2014whether the law was \nclearly established. Id. at 19a. \nSecond, the government attempts to import a \nclearly-established-law requirement into the statutory \nanalysis. It offers (BIO 13) a poisoned chalice: \u201cThe gov-\nernment agrees that a constitutional mandate  * * *  can \neliminate a government official\u2019s discretion when it  \n* * *  was clearly established before the officer acted.\u201d \n\n8 \n \n \n(Emphasis added.) To support this proposition, the gov-\nernment says (BIO 13) that \u201c[m]any of the cases that pe-\ntitioners cite are consistent with that position, as the \ngovernment explained in its brief in opposition (at 8\u201311) \nin Shivers v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. \n21-682).\u201d \nThis is incorrect. No circuit has ever imported a \nclearly-established-law requirement into its discretion-\nary-function analysis. When the government has invited \ncircuits to do so, they have unanimously declined\u2014as \nthe government concedes. BIO 13 n.3 (citing Torres-Es-\ntrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2023) (\u201cWe agree \nwith the Third Circuit [in Xi] and decline to import the \n\u2018clearly established\u2019 requirement into the discretionary-\nfunction analysis.\u201d)); see also Xi, 68 F.4th at 839\u2013840. \nIt is also worth noting that the government\u2019s posi-\ntion that the Constitution can limit the discretionary \nfunction exception is a change of course. In Shivers, the \ngovernment recently defended the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cCongress left no room for [an] extra-tex-\ntual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion.\u2019\u201d Shivers v. United \nStates, 1 F.4th 924, 930 (11th Cir. 2021); see, e.g., Shivers \nBIO 4. But now, the government agrees (BIO 13) that \nthe Eleventh Circuit is wrong. So rather than defend the \nShivers rule here, the government offers its own views \non how the exception and the Constitution intersect. \nThis shift on the merits illustrates the deep confusion \nover the proper scope of the FTCA and further high-\nlights the need for this Court\u2019s intervention. Cf. Xi, 68 \nF.4th at 843 (Bibas, J., concurring). \n2. Actual Policy Grounding. Because raiding the \nwrong house is an act without \u201cground[ing] in the policy \nof [any] regulatory regime,\u201d Petitioners\u2019 claims would \n\n9 \n \n \nhave proceeded in the Third Circuit. Cestonaro v. \nUnited States, 211 F.3d 749, 753 (3d Cir. 2000). There, \nunlike in the Eleventh Circuit and others, hypothetical \npolicy bases will not suffice. See Pet. 28\u201331.  \nRather than dispute this split, the government mis-\ncharacterizes our position. The government argues (BIO \n11) that Petitioners advocate the consideration of an \n\u201cagent\u2019s subjective intent,\u201d whereas United States v. \nGaubert requires consideration of an officer\u2019s acts alone. \n499 U.S. 315, 325 (1991). From there, the government \nclaims that the Eleventh Circuit correctly focused on \nGuerra\u2019s acts because the \u201c\u2018decision as to how to locate \nand identify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019 is the kind \nof act that requires discretion.\u201d (Quoting Pet. App. 18a.) \nThe government\u2019s argument is misdirected and circular. \nFirst, we do not advocate for the consideration of \nsubjective intent. Rather, we explain (Pet. 29\u201330) that \nthe Third Circuit evaluates \u201cthe act\u201d\u2014not intent\u2014of a \ngovernment employee to assess whether there is \u201ca \u2018ra-\ntional nexus\u2019 between the act at issue \u2018and social, eco-\nnomic and political concerns[.]\u2019\u201d Pet. 30 (quoting Ces-\ntonaro, 211 F.3d at 759). Thus, the government is simply \nmistaken. Our position is that, if the Eleventh Circuit \nhad considered whether a line-level FBI agent\u2019s act of \nleading a raid on the wrong house is one with an actual \npolicy grounding in some social, economic, or political \nconcern, the panel would have reached a different out-\ncome. \nSecond, the government\u2019s opposition is unsound by \nits own logic. The parties agree that the discretionary-\nfunction exception extends only to acts \u201csusceptible to \npolicy analysis\u201d and thus \u201cof the kind that the discretion-\nary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d BIO 11; \n\n10 \n \n \nPet. 24 (both quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322\u2013323). \nFrom there, the government spins a circular conclusion. \nIt defends the decision below because Guerra\u2019s failed at-\ntempt to locate the correct house to raid \u201cis the kind of \nact that requires discretion.\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 18a.) But \nthis conclusion says nothing about policy\u2014actual or hy-\npothetical\u2014and disregards Gaubert\u2019s second prong. \nThe Eleventh Circuit committed a similar error. \nThere\u2019s no way to square its conclusion with Gaubert\u2019s \nstatement that even \u201cobviously discretionary acts\u201d\u2014\nlike driving\u2014can fall outside the exception because, alt-\nhough they require the \u201cconstant exercise of discretion\u201d \nthey are acts that \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. The same is true \nfor raiding a house and most other workaday law-en-\nforcement acts.  \n3. Carelessness. Because raiding the wrong house is \nan inherently careless act, Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded in the Second, Fourth, and Seventh Cir-\ncuits. See also, e.g., Indian Towing Co. v. United States, \n350 U.S. 61, 68\u201369 (1955) (holding that careless mainte-\nnance of a lighthouse triggered liability). The Eleventh \nCircuit has not adopted these circuits\u2019 approach. See \nPet. 34.  \nAgain, the government does not dispute the split. It \nresponds (BIO 14) that \u201c[p]etitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly\u201d \nand, anyway, that the Eleventh Circuit concluded \nGuerra took \u201c\u2018reasonable\u2019 steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mis-\ntake[.]\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 14a.) \n\n11 \n \n \nOn the contrary, Petitioners have consistently ar-\ngued that Guerra\u2019s \u201cacts and the manner in which they \noccurred\u201d were negligent. Pet. C.A. Br. 44. After all, Pe-\ntitioners pleaded negligence claims under the FTCA. \nThe circuits that do not apply the discretionary-function \nexception to careless acts have used negligence as a \nproxy. See Coulthurst v. United States, 214 F.3d 106, \n111 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201cIf the plaintiff can establish that neg-\nligence of this sort occurred, his claims are not barred by \nthe DFE, and he is entitled to recover under the \nFTCA.\u201d). The panel, however, dismissed Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims without considering how Guerra\u2019s negligence af-\nfects the discretionary-function exception.  \n4. The Law-Enforcement Proviso. Finally, under \nEleventh Circuit precedent, the discretionary-function \nexception does not apply to claims embraced by the law-\nenforcement proviso. Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d \n1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009). As discussed above, this \nmeans that if the Court removes the Supremacy Clause \nbar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims will proceed.  \nThe Court has explained it was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d to \nCongress that the law-enforcement proviso would en-\nsure a cause of action for federal wrong-house raids. \nCarlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Congress en-\nacted the proviso to \u201cdeprive the Federal Government \nof the defense of sovereign immunity in cases in which \nFederal law enforcement agents, acting within the scope \nof their employment, or under color of Federal law, com-\nmit  * * *  assault, battery, false imprisonment, false ar-\nrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process.\u201d S. Rep. \nNo. 93-588, at 3 (1973). The text of the proviso accom-\nplishes this, extending liability for these intentional \n\n12 \n \n \ntorts \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investigative \nor law enforcement officers[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  \nThe government (BIO 15\u201319) offers several argu-\nments for why the Eleventh Circuit is wrong to hold \nthat the FTCA allows the claims that the law-enforce-\nment proviso says it does. The government then con-\ncludes (BIO 17) that the proviso only allows claims that \nwould otherwise be actionable under Bivens, subject to \nqualified immunity. These arguments and the govern-\nment\u2019s conclusion are incorrect, but they are better left \nfor merits briefing. We agree with the government (BIO \n22) that determining how the proviso and exception in-\nteract is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d But this split is just one of the several that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 case implicates. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant the petition and confirm the \navailability of the cause of action Congress conferred. \nRespectfully submitted on December 20, 2024, \nLISA C.

No. 93-588 (1973) .............................................. 4, 11 \n \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREPLY ARGUMENT \nThe government agrees that the circuits are split \nover both questions presented: \nQP 1: \u201cPetitioners correctly observe that the [Elev-\nenth Circuit]\u2019s reasoning for rejecting [claims \nunder the Supremacy Clause] differs from the \napproach of other circuits[.]\u201d BIO 8. \nQP 2:  \u201cAs petitioners acknowledge  * * *  , every \ncourt of appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014to consider the issue has held that the \ndiscretionary function exception applies to \ntort claims listed in the law enforcement pro-\nviso[.]\u201d E.g., BIO 19. \nAnd the government does not dispute their importance. \nOn the contrary, it insists (BIO 22) that resolving the \nlatter split is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d  \nEven though the government agrees that the Elev-\nenth Circuit is wrong about both the Supremacy Clause \n(BIO 20\u201321) and the discretionary-function exception \n(BIO 13\u201320), it urges this Court to leave the splits in \nplace. In its view, this case is a bad vehicle because: (1) \ncircuits other than the Eleventh Circuit apply the dis-\ncretionary-function exception to law-enforcement pro-\nviso claims; (2) the exception, as interpreted by the gov-\nernment, is expansive enough to snuff out nearly all pro-\nviso claims; and, based on this interpretation, (3) \u201cno \ncourt of appeals  * * *  would have reached a different \nresult\u201d than the Eleventh Circuit did below. BIO 8.  \nThere are two problems with this vehicle argument. \nFirst, it hinges on a circuit split\u2014one that caused the \n\n2 \n \n \nEleventh Circuit to create the Supremacy Clause bar \nand that, according to the government (BIO 22), the \nCourt must resolve to properly construe the FTCA. Sec-\nond, no court of appeals has adopted the government\u2019s \nall-encompassing interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. Many, however, have rejected it.  \nBecause FBI Special Agent Lawrence Guerra\u2019s ac-\ntions were unconstitutional, careless, and unmoored \nfrom actual policy (Pet. 23\u201334), Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded under one theory or another in eight cir-\ncuits. And were it not for the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s unique \nSupremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims \nwould have proceeded below. Pet. App. 17a\u201319a, Martin \nv. United States, 2024 WL 1716235, at *6\u20138 (11th Cir. \nApr. 22, 2024). \nRather than mark this case as a bad vehicle, the BIO \nmerely offers the government\u2019s merits arguments about \nhow the Court should resolve the splits. As a result, the \nBIO complements the petition at the certiorari stage: \nBoth agree that the Eleventh Circuit is on the wrong \nside of important circuit splits, and both show that this \nCourt\u2019s intervention is necessary. Granting certiorari \nwill not only allow the Court to resolve the splits, but \nalso to address the apparent problem of unaccountable \nwrong-house raids in this country. See also Jimerson v. \nLewis, petition for cert. pending, No. 24-473 (1983 claims \nbarred by qualified immunity).  \n\n3 \n \n \nI. \nBut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims under the law-enforcement proviso \nwould have proceeded. \nAs we have explained (Pet. 25\u201328), Congress enacted \nthe FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso in response to a \npair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illinois, \njust like the raid here. See also Members of Congress \nAmici Br. 4\u201313 (e.g., observing that this case \u201caris[es] \nunder the precise circumstances that motivated Con-\ngress to enact the law-enforcement proviso\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). But the Eleventh Circuit held that the FTCA \nviolates the Supremacy Clause in this case. Pet. App. \n16a\u201319a. \nWhile the government agrees that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s application of the Supremacy Clause to the FTCA \nis wrong (BIO 20\u201321), it argues that any error is harm-\nless. This is incorrect. Under Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims would have proceeded \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, which effectively \nholds that large swaths of the FTCA are unconstitu-\ntional. This holding, alone, merits the Court\u2019s review. \n1. In the Eleventh Circuit, Congress\u2019s waiver of sov-\nereign immunity violates the Supremacy Clause when-\never it applies to acts of federal employees that \u201chave \nsome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d (for instance, \nif officers act \u201cwithin their discretionary authority\u201d) \n\u201cand can reasonably be characterized as complying with \nthe full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nKordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022), and citing Denson v. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, \n1348 (11th Cir. 2009)). Although the government agrees \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA claims, \n\n4 \n \n \nit nonetheless contends (BIO 20) that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cpremise is sound.\u201d It is not.  \nBorrowing from its BIO in Denson, BIO at 25, Den-\nson v. United States, 560 U.S. 952 (2010) (mem.), the \ngovernment argues here (BIO 20) that \u201cCongress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.\u201d But the government overlooks that in this case, \nunlike in Denson, the district court rejected the govern-\nment\u2019s assertion of state-law privilege to extinguish Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 proviso claims. Compare Pet. App. 63a\u201365a, \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1299\u20131300 \n(N.D. Ga. 2022) (rejecting Georgia-law privilege argu-\nments), with Denson v. United States, 2005 WL \n8160747, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 9, 2005) (accepting Flor-\nida-law privilege arguments). Only after the district \ncourt rejected the government\u2019s privilege argument did \nit move for reconsideration here, raising the Supremacy \nClause bar for the first time. Pet. App. 22a\u201323a, Martin \nv. United States, 2022 WL 18263039, at *1 (N.D. Ga. \nDec. 30, 2022). So even if Congress somehow intended to \nexclude law-enforcement-privileged acts from the \nFTCA, but see 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (accepting \u201cprivate \nperson\u201d liability); 28 U.S.C. 2680(h); S. Rep. No. 93-588 \n(1973), Guerra\u2019s acts were not privileged. The only thing \nstanding between Petitioners and their ability to pro-\nceed on their proviso claims in the Eleventh Circuit is \nthe Supremacy Clause bar. \n2. Whatever interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception ultimately emerges from the multiple \ncircuit splits, two things are clear: This case invokes the \n\n5 \n \n \ncause of action Congress created through the FTCA, \nand the Eleventh Circuit has held that cause of action \nunconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. \nThis Court\u2019s review is needed because the Eleventh \nCircuit has imposed a constraint on Congress\u2019s power to \nwaive sovereign immunity\u2014a constitutional issue of \n\u201cobvious importance.\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 9 \n(2005). As the Members of Congress note (Br. 20), the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s application of this constraint \u201ceffec-\ntively declared the FTCA unconstitutional in its core ap-\nplications.\u201d This Court regularly grants review when a \nlower court \u201cexercise[s]  * * *  the grave power of annul-\nling an Act of Congress.\u201d United States v. Gainey, 380 \nU.S. 63, 65 (1965); see, e.g., United States v. Bajakajian, \n524 U.S. 321, 327 (1998) (\u201cBecause the Court of Appeals\u2019 \nholding  * * *  invalidated a portion of an Act of Con-\ngress, we granted certiorari.\u201d).  \nThe Supremacy Clause bar is independently worthy \nof this Court\u2019s review, if not summary reversal. \nII. \nThe discretionary-function exception would not \nhave barred Petitioners\u2019 claims in most other \ncircuits.  \nThe government further argues (BIO 8) that, even if \nthe Eleventh Circuit had not invoked the Supremacy \nClause and had not excluded the proviso claims from the \ndiscretionary-function exception\u2014that is to say, if the \nlaw of the Eleventh Circuit were the opposite of what it \nis\u2014the errors in this case would be harmless. That\u2019s be-\ncause, in the government\u2019s view, Petitioners\u2019 claims oth-\nerwise fall under the discretionary-function exception.  \n\n6 \n \n \nThis is incorrect under any of the four splits we have \nidentified (Pet. 23\u201334). Just as Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims would have proceeded in the Eleventh Circuit \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded under the varying interpreta-\ntions of the discretionary-function exception in most \nother circuits. \n1. Unconstitutional Conduct. Because the wrong-\nhouse raid was unconstitutional, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded in seven circuits. Pet. 31\u201333. The \nThird Circuit recently explained, \u201cwe\u2014and nearly \nevery other circuit to have considered the issue\u2014have \nheld that \u2018conduct cannot be discretionary if it violates \nthe Constitution[.]\u2019\u201d Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 838 (3d \nCir. 2023). But the Eleventh and Seventh Circuits hold \nthat the Constitution imposes no limits on an officer\u2019s \ndiscretionary acts. See Pet. 32 & n.13. \nThe government does not dispute this split. In fact, \nit agrees with Petitioners\u2014but not the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014that the Constitution can curb discretion. It nev-\nertheless argues (BIO 12\u201313) that this case does not im-\nplicate the split because the Eleventh Circuit held that \nGuerra did not violate the Fourth Amendment. And \neven if he did, the government asserts, only clearly es-\ntablished constitutional principles can limit discretion \nunder the FTCA. \nThe government is wrong on the first point (a vehicle \nargument), and no circuit has ever adopted its position \non the second (a merits argument), though two have ex-\nplicitly rejected it. \nFirst, the Eleventh Circuit did not reach the merits \nof Petitioners\u2019 Fourth Amendment claims. The govern-\n\n7 \n \n \nment cherry-picks several quotes to suggest otherwise, \nclaiming that the panel \u201cheld that \u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d BIO 13 (quoting \nPet. App. 19a), and \u201c\u2018constitute[d] the kind of reasonable \nmistakes that the Fourth Amendment contemplates,\u2019\u201d \nibid. (quoting Pet. App. 14a). It also contends that the \npanel \u201cconsidered as part of its Supremacy Clause anal-\nysis whether Guerra \u2018complied with the full range of the \nFourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 13 n.2 (quoting Pet. App. \n19a).  \nBut the government omits language from the opinion \nbelow that expressly forecloses its interpretation. In the \nBivens section of the opinion, the panel clarified that \n\u201cthe sole issue for our resolution is whether [Guerra\u2019s] \nactions violated clearly established law.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe panel\u2019s constitutional discussion flows from this \npremise. Accordingly, the panel concluded\u2014after ad-\ndressing Guerra\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe law \nat the time did not clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s pre-\nparatory steps before the warrant execution would vio-\nlate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 14a\u201315a. Further, \nthe full-range-of-the-Fourth-Amendment quote comes \nfrom the panel\u2019s Supremacy Clause analysis, where the \npanel explained that the supremacy question involved \n\u201cthe same inquiry as the inquiry we employed in the \nqualified immunity analysis\u201d\u2014whether the law was \nclearly established. Id. at 19a. \nSecond, the government attempts to import a \nclearly-established-law requirement into the statutory \nanalysis. It offers (BIO 13) a poisoned chalice: \u201cThe gov-\nernment agrees that a constitutional mandate  * * *  can \neliminate a government official\u2019s discretion when it  \n* * *  was clearly established before the officer acted.\u201d \n\n8 \n \n \n(Emphasis added.) To support this proposition, the gov-\nernment says (BIO 13) that \u201c[m]any of the cases that pe-\ntitioners cite are consistent with that position, as the \ngovernment explained in its brief in opposition (at 8\u201311) \nin Shivers v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. \n21-682).\u201d \nThis is incorrect. No circuit has ever imported a \nclearly-established-law requirement into its discretion-\nary-function analysis. When the government has invited \ncircuits to do so, they have unanimously declined\u2014as \nthe government concedes. BIO 13 n.3 (citing Torres-Es-\ntrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2023) (\u201cWe agree \nwith the Third Circuit [in Xi] and decline to import the \n\u2018clearly established\u2019 requirement into the discretionary-\nfunction analysis.\u201d)); see also Xi, 68 F.4th at 839\u2013840. \nIt is also worth noting that the government\u2019s posi-\ntion that the Constitution can limit the discretionary \nfunction exception is a change of course. In Shivers, the \ngovernment recently defended the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cCongress left no room for [an] extra-tex-\ntual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion.\u2019\u201d Shivers v. United \nStates, 1 F.4th 924, 930 (11th Cir. 2021); see, e.g., Shivers \nBIO 4. But now, the government agrees (BIO 13) that \nthe Eleventh Circuit is wrong. So rather than defend the \nShivers rule here, the government offers its own views \non how the exception and the Constitution intersect. \nThis shift on the merits illustrates the deep confusion \nover the proper scope of the FTCA and further high-\nlights the need for this Court\u2019s intervention. Cf. Xi, 68 \nF.4th at 843 (Bibas, J., concurring). \n2. Actual Policy Grounding. Because raiding the \nwrong house is an act without \u201cground[ing] in the policy \nof [any] regulatory regime,\u201d Petitioners\u2019 claims would \n\n9 \n \n \nhave proceeded in the Third Circuit. Cestonaro v. \nUnited States, 211 F.3d 749, 753 (3d Cir. 2000). There, \nunlike in the Eleventh Circuit and others, hypothetical \npolicy bases will not suffice. See Pet. 28\u201331.  \nRather than dispute this split, the government mis-\ncharacterizes our position. The government argues (BIO \n11) that Petitioners advocate the consideration of an \n\u201cagent\u2019s subjective intent,\u201d whereas United States v. \nGaubert requires consideration of an officer\u2019s acts alone. \n499 U.S. 315, 325 (1991). From there, the government \nclaims that the Eleventh Circuit correctly focused on \nGuerra\u2019s acts because the \u201c\u2018decision as to how to locate \nand identify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019 is the kind \nof act that requires discretion.\u201d (Quoting Pet. App. 18a.) \nThe government\u2019s argument is misdirected and circular. \nFirst, we do not advocate for the consideration of \nsubjective intent. Rather, we explain (Pet. 29\u201330) that \nthe Third Circuit evaluates \u201cthe act\u201d\u2014not intent\u2014of a \ngovernment employee to assess whether there is \u201ca \u2018ra-\ntional nexus\u2019 between the act at issue \u2018and social, eco-\nnomic and political concerns[.]\u2019\u201d Pet. 30 (quoting Ces-\ntonaro, 211 F.3d at 759). Thus, the government is simply \nmistaken. Our position is that, if the Eleventh Circuit \nhad considered whether a line-level FBI agent\u2019s act of \nleading a raid on the wrong house is one with an actual \npolicy grounding in some social, economic, or political \nconcern, the panel would have reached a different out-\ncome. \nSecond, the government\u2019s opposition is unsound by \nits own logic. The parties agree that the discretionary-\nfunction exception extends only to acts \u201csusceptible to \npolicy analysis\u201d and thus \u201cof the kind that the discretion-\nary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d BIO 11; \n\n10 \n \n \nPet. 24 (both quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322\u2013323). \nFrom there, the government spins a circular conclusion. \nIt defends the decision below because Guerra\u2019s failed at-\ntempt to locate the correct house to raid \u201cis the kind of \nact that requires discretion.\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 18a.) But \nthis conclusion says nothing about policy\u2014actual or hy-\npothetical\u2014and disregards Gaubert\u2019s second prong. \nThe Eleventh Circuit committed a similar error. \nThere\u2019s no way to square its conclusion with Gaubert\u2019s \nstatement that even \u201cobviously discretionary acts\u201d\u2014\nlike driving\u2014can fall outside the exception because, alt-\nhough they require the \u201cconstant exercise of discretion\u201d \nthey are acts that \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. The same is true \nfor raiding a house and most other workaday law-en-\nforcement acts.  \n3. Carelessness. Because raiding the wrong house is \nan inherently careless act, Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded in the Second, Fourth, and Seventh Cir-\ncuits. See also, e.g., Indian Towing Co. v. United States, \n350 U.S. 61, 68\u201369 (1955) (holding that careless mainte-\nnance of a lighthouse triggered liability). The Eleventh \nCircuit has not adopted these circuits\u2019 approach. See \nPet. 34.  \nAgain, the government does not dispute the split. It \nresponds (BIO 14) that \u201c[p]etitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly\u201d \nand, anyway, that the Eleventh Circuit concluded \nGuerra took \u201c\u2018reasonable\u2019 steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mis-\ntake[.]\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 14a.) \n\n11 \n \n \nOn the contrary, Petitioners have consistently ar-\ngued that Guerra\u2019s \u201cacts and the manner in which they \noccurred\u201d were negligent. Pet. C.A. Br. 44. After all, Pe-\ntitioners pleaded negligence claims under the FTCA. \nThe circuits that do not apply the discretionary-function \nexception to careless acts have used negligence as a \nproxy. See Coulthurst v. United States, 214 F.3d 106, \n111 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201cIf the plaintiff can establish that neg-\nligence of this sort occurred, his claims are not barred by \nthe DFE, and he is entitled to recover under the \nFTCA.\u201d). The panel, however, dismissed Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims without considering how Guerra\u2019s negligence af-\nfects the discretionary-function exception.  \n4. The Law-Enforcement Proviso. Finally, under \nEleventh Circuit precedent, the discretionary-function \nexception does not apply to claims embraced by the law-\nenforcement proviso. Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d \n1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009). As discussed above, this \nmeans that if the Court removes the Supremacy Clause \nbar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims will proceed.  \nThe Court has explained it was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d to \nCongress that the law-enforcement proviso would en-\nsure a cause of action for federal wrong-house raids. \nCarlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Congress en-\nacted the proviso to \u201cdeprive the Federal Government \nof the defense of sovereign immunity in cases in which \nFederal law enforcement agents, acting within the scope \nof their employment, or under color of Federal law, com-\nmit  * * *  assault, battery, false imprisonment, false ar-\nrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process.\u201d S. Rep. \nNo. 93-588, at 3 (1973). The text of the proviso accom-\nplishes this, extending liability for these intentional \n\n12 \n \n \ntorts \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investigative \nor law enforcement officers[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  \nThe government (BIO 15\u201319) offers several argu-\nments for why the Eleventh Circuit is wrong to hold \nthat the FTCA allows the claims that the law-enforce-\nment proviso says it does. The government then con-\ncludes (BIO 17) that the proviso only allows claims that \nwould otherwise be actionable under Bivens, subject to \nqualified immunity. These arguments and the govern-\nment\u2019s conclusion are incorrect, but they are better left \nfor merits briefing. We agree with the government (BIO \n22) that determining how the proviso and exception in-\nteract is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d But this split is just one of the several that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 case implicates. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant the petition and confirm the \navailability of the cause of action Congress conferred. \nRespectfully submitted on December 20, 2024, \nLISA C.

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

The district \ncourt\u2019s opinion, granting the government reconsidera-\ntion and dismissing the case, Pet. App. 20a, is unre-\nported but available as Martin v. United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 517, 536 (2008) (discussing how the \nFTCA was made retroactive because Congress wanted to provide \nrecovery for the Empire State Building crash victims); see also 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (making the FTCA effective for claims \u201caccruing \non and after January 1, 1945\u201d). \n\n34 \n \n \nperson not unduly sensitive as to his dignity.\u201d Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted). See also Ga. Code Ann. 51-1-13.\n11 \nTo determine whether the government is liable for \nbattery during a wrong-house raid, a court need not \nevaluate the legitimacy of any governmental policies. \nWe know this, in large part, because the FBI has no pol-\nicies governing the execution of SWAT raids. See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a). Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 335 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part). Three decades later, \u201ccourts are \nstill struggling.\u201d Xi, 68 F.4th at 842 (Bibas, J., concur-\nring). Third Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas recently ob-\nserved that there is still \u201csignificant confusion about \nhow to apply the test,\u201d leading to \u201cat least three \nlongstanding, recurring circuit splits involving the dis-\ncretionary-function exception.\u201d Id. at 843. Cf. Carter v. \nUnited States, 604 U.S. ___, 145 S. Ct. 519, 524 (2025) \n(mem.) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of cert.) \n(\u201cFaced with almost four decades of silence from this \nCourt on the Feres doctrine, lower courts have devel-\noped an array of tests for determining when it is trig-\ngered, leading to inconsistent results on similar facts.\u201d). \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

The district \ncourt\u2019s opinion, granting the government reconsidera-\ntion and dismissing the case, Pet. App. 20a, is unre-\nported but available as Martin v. United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L.

See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a).

The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Public Citizen has a longstanding interest in \npreserving state-law remedies for personal injury \nagainst unwarranted claims of preemption by federal \nlaw under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, and \nhas frequently filed briefs in this Court and others ad-\ndressing Supremacy Clause issues. Public Citizen \nsubmits this brief to address the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Supremacy Clause preempts federal-\nlaw remedies by prohibiting the application of tort \nprinciples derived from state law, which Congress ex-\nplicitly incorporated into federal law when it imposed \ntort liability on the United States under the Federal \nTort Claims Act. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) creates a fed-\neral right of action against the United States for torts \ncommitted by federal employees and waives sovereign \nimmunity for claims that fall within the scope of that \nright of action. The FTCA provides that, with some ex-\nceptions, the United States shall be liable for torts to \nthe same extent as a private person under similar cir-\ncumstances. It does so by adopting as its standard for \nliability the principles of state tort law that would be \napplicable to a private person in the state where the \nallegedly tortious conduct occurred.  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n1 This brief was not authored in whole or part by counsel for \na party. No one other than amicus curiae made a monetary con-\ntribution to preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \n \nUnder the FTCA, those state-law principles do not \napply to claims against the United States by their own \nforce, but because Congress enacted a statute mandat-\ning their application. To ensure that its chosen stand-\nard of liability would not adversely affect legitimate \ngovernment interests, Congress also enacted a baker\u2019s \ndozen of exceptions excusing the United States from \nliability for injuries even if the conduct causing them \nwould be tortious under state law if committed by a \nprivate person. \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit held that the \nConstitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause bars enforcement of \nthe FTCA\u2019s requirement that the tort liability of the \nUnited States be based on principles borrowed from \nstate tort law. According to the court of appeals, the \nSupremacy Clause prohibits imposition of tort liabil-\nity on the United States under the FTCA if the tor-\ntious acts \u201chave some nexus with furthering federal \npolicy and can reasonably be characterized as comply-\ning with the full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 11a \n(quoting Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, \n1293 (11th Cir. 2022), and Denson v. United States, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1344 (11th Cir. 2009)). \nThat holding turns the Supremacy Clause upside-\ndown. The Supremacy Clause, as this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions have explained, is fundamentally a choice-of-law \nprovision, requiring courts to apply requirements of \nthe Constitution and federal laws enacted in accord-\nance with its provisions, notwithstanding purported \ncommands of state law to the contrary. Here, a federal \nlaw\u2014the FTCA\u2014dictates that the United States be \nheld liable in circumstances where a private person \nwould be liable under state tort law. The Supremacy \nClause therefore requires that the FTCA be treated as \nthe supreme law of the land and binds judges to apply \n\n \n3 \n \nthe standard of liability the FTCA specifies. Moreover, \nthe Supremacy Clause by its terms preempts a state \nlaw only to the extent that the state law provides \nsomething \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal law. But when federal \nlaw explicitly borrows state-law principles to supply \nthe federal rule of decision for courts to apply, the ap-\nplication of those principles is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal \nlaw. \nThe court of appeals, however, held that courts \ncannot apply a federal statutory command that, in the \ncourt\u2019s view, is contrary to the purposes and objectives \nof federal law more generally. See Pet. App. 16a. At \nbest, the court has identified an implied conflict be-\ntween the FTCA\u2019s requirements and other supposed \nprinciples of federal law. But the Supremacy Clause \nhas nothing to do with claimed conflicts among federal \nlaws. Resolving tensions within the body of federal \nlaw is, as this Court has pointed out, an ordinary mat-\nter of federal statutory construction not governed by \nSupremacy Clause preemption principles. Thus, the \nanswer to the first question presented by this case\u2014\nwhether the Supremacy Clause bars FTCA claims in \nthe circumstances described by the court of appeals\u2014\nis unequivocally no. The determinative issue in the \ncase is therefore whether the claims at issue fall \nwithin an exception to the FTCA. \nARGUMENT \nI. Liability under the FTCA is imposed by \nfederal statute, not state law. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s erroneous invocation of the \nSupremacy Clause to restrict the application of fed-\neral statutory requirements rests on the mistaken \npremise that FTCA actions against the United States \nare \u201csuits under state law against federal officials \n\n \n4 \n \ncarrying out their executive duties\u201d and, therefore, \nmust be policed under the implied conflict preemption \ndoctrine to ensure that the \u201cstate-law liability\u201d they \nmay impose does not \u201cstand[ ] as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress.\u201d Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th at 1293 \n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). \nThat understanding of the FTCA is flatly wrong.  \nAn FTCA action is a suit under federal law that \nimposes federal-law liability through the application \nof rules of decision dictated by statutory provisions en-\nacted by Congress. The FTCA does not waive the sov-\nereign immunity of the United States against tort \ncauses of action that exist independently of federal \nlaw. Rather, the FTCA itself imposes the liabilities \nthat are subject to its waiver of sovereign immunity \nby providing that \u201c[t]he United States shall be liable\u201d \nin tort for actions of its officers, employees, and agen-\ncies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. The FTCA also creates a federal \ncause of action and grants the federal courts exclusive \njurisdiction to adjudicate actions asserting that cause \nof action. See id. \u00a7 1346(b). The statute specifies the \nprerequisites for bringing FTCA actions and the time \nin which they must be brought, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2675 & 2401; \nidentifies the basic legal principles that govern such \nclaims, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) & 2674; enumerates \u201cexcep-\ntions\u201d to liability that function as defenses, see id. \n\u00a7 2680; limits the remedies and attorney fees availa-\nble when liability is found, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 & 2678; \nspecifies the effect of a judgment in an FTCA action, \nsee id. \u00a7 2676; and provides that the FTCA is the ex-\nclusive remedy for injuries resulting from governmen-\ntal acts or omissions within its scope, see id. \u00a7 2679(b). \nIn short, the United States is liable under the FTCA \n\n \n5 \n \nonly when and to the extent that Congress has im-\nposed liability by statute. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the FTCA none-\ntheless involves \u201csuits under state law\u201d and \u201cstate-law \nliability\u201d reflects a misunderstanding of Congress\u2019s \ndecision to borrow state-law tort principles to define \nthe tort liability that the FTCA imposes. Specifically, \nthe FTCA provides that the United States is liable in \ntort \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a \nprivate individual under like circumstances,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2674\u2014that is, it is liable \u201cunder circum-\nstances where the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the \nlaw of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 1346(b); see also id. \u00a7 2672 (using same language \nto describe authority of federal agencies to settle tort \nclaims). \nThat language, however, does not suggest that \nstate law applies of its own force to the federal govern-\nment in FTCA actions or that the resulting liability is \nliability under state law. To the contrary, state tort \nprinciples apply only because, and to the extent that, \nCongress has chosen to use them as the standard for \nthe liability that the FTCA creates. Indeed, the state-\nlaw principles that Congress incorporated to deter-\nmine the liability of the United States under the \nFTCA do so wholly without regard to whether they are \napplicable to the United States or any other govern-\nmental body under state law. For example, this Court \nlong ago held that state tort defenses and other limi-\ntations on liability applicable to government defend-\nants are not incorporated in the FTCA. See United \nStates v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 164\u201365 (1963); Indian \nTowing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 65 (1955). \nThus, the FTCA does not provide that the United \n\n \n6 \n \nStates is liable when state law says it (or government \nentities more generally) is liable, but instead that it is \nliable under circumstances similar to those in which \nstate law would say that someone else (a private per-\nson) would be liable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The imposi-\ntion of liability on the United States in such circum-\nstances does not find its source in state law, but is en-\ntirely the creation of a federal statute. \nMoreover, Congress adopted special defenses not \notherwise available under state law to ensure that its \nchoice of using state tort principles applicable to pri-\nvate actors does not impinge on federal governmental \ninterests. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680; Muniz, 374 U.S. at 163 \n(\u201cCongress has taken steps to protect the Government \nfrom liability that would seriously handicap efficient \ngovernment operations.\u201d). Those defenses, where ap-\nplicable, exclude liability for such things as the exer-\ncise of discretionary governmental functions, id. \n\u00a7 2680(a), \nnegligent \ntransmission \nof \nmail, \nid. \n\u00a7 2680(b), imposition of quarantines, id. \u00a7 2680(f); \ncommission of certain intentional torts, id. \u00a7 2680(h); \nregulation of the monetary system, id. \u00a7 2680(i), and \ncombat operations of the armed forces, id. \u00a7 2680(j). \nThe statute also incorporates certain federal govern-\nmental immunities, id. \u00a7 2674 (third paragraph), and \nexcludes constitutional torts and certain federal stat-\nutory claims, id. \u00a7 2679(b)(2). The result of this retic-\nulated federal statutory scheme is a form of liability \nthat no state purports to or could impose on the United \nStates: namely, liability in circumstances analogous \nto those under which state law would recognize pri-\nvate tort liability, but subject to defenses and other \nprocedural and substantive limitations designed by \nCongress to balance federal government interests \n\n \n7 \n \nagainst the interest in providing recovery to persons \ninjured by negligent or wrongful government actions. \nAlthough this Court has occasionally referred in \nshorthand to FTCA actions against the United States \nas involving \u201cstate-law tort suits against the Federal \nGovernment,\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, 210 \n(2021), its decisions have consistently recognized that \nthe liability of the United States in such actions is \ngrounded on federal law, in the form of a statute en-\nacted by Congress. For example, in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 \nU.S. 471 (1994), the Court observed that, through the \nFTCA\u2014and specifically through the language codified \nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)\u2014\u201cthe United States has \u2026 \u2018ren-\nder[ed]\u2019 itself liable\u201d for torts in circumstances in \nwhich state law would hold a private person liable. Id. \nat 477 (emphasis added; quoting Richards v. United \nStates, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962)). The Court has explicitly \nrecognized that \u201cwhether a private person would be \nresponsible for similar negligence under the laws of \nthe State where the acts occurred\u201d is \u201cthe test estab-\nlished by the Tort Claims Act for determining the \nUnited States\u2019 liability.\u201d Rayonier Inc. v. United \nStates, 352 U.S. 315, 319 (1957). The standard of lia-\nbility \u201cis controlled by a formal expression of the will \nof Congress,\u201d Richards, 369 U.S. at 7, which deter-\nmines the scope of the \u201cremedies provided by Con-\ngress,\u201d Muniz, 374 U.S. at 165\u201366. Thus, whether a \nprivate person would be liable for similar conduct un-\nder state tort law is one of the \u201celements\u201d of the federal \ncause of action created by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Brown-\nback, 592 U.S. at 212; see also id. at 216 (\u201c[O]ne ele-\nment of an FTCA claim is that the plaintiff establish \nthat the Government employee would be liable under \nstate law.\u201d).  \n\n \n8 \n \nThis Court\u2019s consistent readings of the FTCA con-\nfirm what is plain from the statutory language. State \nlaw itself does not impose liability under the FTCA. \nState-law principles that would apply to the liability \nof private persons are used as part of the determina-\ntion of the liability of the United States only because \na federal law duly enacted by Congress so requires. \nII. The Supremacy Clause does not limit, but \nrather requires, application of federal law. \nThe Supremacy Clause dictates that federal laws \nenacted pursuant to the Constitution are the law of \nthe land, and it resolves conflicts between the com-\nmands of federal laws and contrary state laws. The \nClause thus compels adherence to the FTCA\u2019s di-\nrective that state-law principles that would apply to \nprivate tortfeasors form the basis of the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s tort liability. The application of those prin-\nciples cannot be contrary to federal law when federal \nlaw expressly requires their application. \nThe Supremacy Clause provides that \u201c[t]his Con-\nstitution, and the Laws of the United States which \nshall be made in Pursuance thereof \u2026 shall be the su-\npreme Law of the Land; \u2026 any Thing in the Constitu-\ntion or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwith-\nstanding.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. The Supremacy \nClause requires \u201cpreemption\u201d of state laws where giv-\ning them effect would be in derogation of the suprem-\nacy of the Constitution or a valid federal law enacted \nunder it\u2014that is, where state law stands in contradic-\ntion to some applicable command of federal law. See \nMurphy v. NCAA, 584 U.S. 453, 477 (2018). All forms \nof preemption, in other words, involve \u201ca clash be-\ntween a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s legisla-\ntive power and conflicting state law.\u201d Murphy, 584 \n\n \n9 \n \nU.S. at 479. Where such a clash occurs, the Supremacy \nClause provides a \u201crule of decision\u201d: Courts must give \neffect to the federal law, not the conflicting state one. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 324 (2015).  \nMore broadly, the Constitution\u2019s creation of a sov-\nereign federal union under a government that, \u201cwithin \nits own sphere,\u201d is \u201csupreme\u201d necessarily \u201cexempt[s] \n[that government\u2019s] operations from [the] influence\u201d of \n\u201cpower vested in subordinate governments.\u201d McCul-\nloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 427 (1819). That is, \u201cthe \nactivities of the Federal Government are free from \nregulation by any state,\u201d Mayo v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 441, 445 (1943), because a \u201csubordinate sover-\neign\u201d cannot control the government of the United \nStates without its consent, Hancock v. Train, 426 U.S. \n167, 179 (1976). As this Court recently explained, \n\u201c[t]he Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause generally im-\nmunizes the Federal Government from state laws that \ndirectly regulate or discriminate against it.\u201d United \nStates v. Washington, 596 U.S. 832, 835 (2022). \nBecause preemption under the Supremacy Clause \nis always triggered by a clash between federal and \nstate law, however, the Supremacy Clause allows even \ndirect application of state regulations to the federal \ngovernment if authorized by a federal statute. In that \ncircumstance, state regulation is in conformity with, \nnot contrary to, the laws of the United States. See \nUnited States v. Washington, 596 U.S. at 839\u201340. \nLikewise, not all differences between state law and \nfederal law, or all impacts of state laws on federal gov-\nernment interests, give rise to preemption, because \nnot all involve contradictory or conflicting federal and \nstate commands. See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda Motor \nof Am., Inc., 562 U.S. 323 (2011); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 \n\n \n10 \n \nU.S. 555 (2009); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 \nU.S. 51 (2002). And where a federal law authorizes or \ncontemplates the operation of state law, the federal \nlaw does not displace state law because giving it effect, \nas the Supremacy Clause demands, requires that \nstate law not be disturbed. Put another way, state \nlaws are not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal laws that require or \npermit the state laws\u2019 operation.  \nThus, as this Court has said time and again,  \u201c[t]he \npurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u201d in de-\ntermining the preemptive effects of federal law. Retail \nClerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96, 103 \n(1963); see Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 578 \nU.S. 150, 162\u201363 (2016); Wyeth, 562 U.S. at 565. This \nproposition holds good in \u201cevery pre-emption case,\u201d \nHughes, 578 U.S. at 163, \u201c[w]hatever the category of \npreemption asserted\u201d\u2014be it express, implied, or field \npreemption. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. \n761, 785 (2019) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judg-\nment). \nIt follows that, in the first instance, \u201c \u2018[e]vidence of \npre-emptive purpose,\u2019 whether express or implied, \nmust \u2026 be \u2018sought in the text and structure of the stat-\nute at issue.\u2019 \u201d Va. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead \nopinion of Gorsuch, J.) (quoting CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nEasterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664 (1993)). Thus, a litigant \nclaiming preemption based on conflict between state \nlaw and the requirements, purposes, or objectives of \nfederal law \u201cmust point specifically to \u2018a constitutional \ntext or a federal statute\u2019 that does the displacing or \nconflicts with state law.\u201d Id. at 767 (citation omitted). \nCourts considering such claims, moreover, must re-\nspect both \u201cwhat Congress wrote\u201d and \u201cwhat it didn\u2019t \nwrite.\u201d Id. at 765. The inquiry turns on \u201cwhat can be \n\n \n11 \n \nfound in the law itself,\u201d id. at 779, not on \u201cabstract and \nunenacted legislative desires,\u201d id. at 778. \nIn light of these principles, courts must give effect \nto federal statutory provisions whose terms manifest \nan intent to allow application of state laws even when \nthose laws might otherwise be impliedly preempted \nbecause of a conflict of some kind with federal law. \nSee, e.g., Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 575; Silkwood v. Kerr-\nMcGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 256 (1984). Disregard of \nsuch statutory provisions would violate the cardinal \nrule that preemption of whatever stripe\u2014express \npreemption, implied field preemption, or implied con-\nflict preemption\u2014is always a matter of congressional \nintent discernible from statutory text and structure. \nVa. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead opinion of Gor-\nsuch, J.); id. at 785 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the \njudgment). When a federal statute allows or requires \nstate law to operate, effectuating the law enacted by \nCongress requires giving effect to its command that \nstate laws remain operative. If a federal statute does \nnot in some way require displacement of state law, \nsuch displacement cannot be necessary to ensure the \nfederal statute\u2019s \u201csupremacy.\u201d \nThus, the Court has repeatedly held that federal \nstatutes may limit or foreclose the otherwise preemp-\ntive effects of federal law. See, e.g., Calif. Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ass\u2019n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272 (1987); Malone v. \nWhite Motor Corp., 435 U.S. 497 (1978); Schermer-\nhorn, 375 U.S. 96. Such \u201cantipre-emption provisions,\u201d \nas Justice Scalia labeled them, Guerra, 479 U.S. at \n295 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), are, like \nother federal statutory commands, the law of the land \nand must be given effect under the Supremacy Clause.  \n\n \n12 \n \nIndeed, the Supremacy Clause effectively allows \nCongress to reverse the ordinary rule that federal law \npreempts conflicting state law and to provide that \nstate laws prevail in cases of conflict. For example, the \nCourt has held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \nwhich provides that no federal statute \u201cshall be con-\nstrued to invalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d state laws \nregulating the business of insurance, 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1012(b), functions as a reverse-preemption provi-\nsion: Where \u201cthere is a direct conflict between [a] fed-\neral \u2026 statute and [state] law,\u201d the \u201cterms of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act\u201d provide that \u201cfederal law \nmust yield.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, \n502 (1993). Because the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a \nlaw of the United States enacted pursuant to the Con-\nsti\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Public Citizen has a longstanding interest in \npreserving state-law remedies for personal injury \nagainst unwarranted claims of preemption by federal \nlaw under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, and \nhas frequently filed briefs in this Court and others ad-\ndressing Supremacy Clause issues. Public Citizen \nsubmits this brief to address the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that the Supremacy Clause preempts federal-\nlaw remedies by prohibiting the application of tort \nprinciples derived from state law, which Congress ex-\nplicitly incorporated into federal law when it imposed \ntort liability on the United States under the Federal \nTort Claims Act. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) creates a fed-\neral right of action against the United States for torts \ncommitted by federal employees and waives sovereign \nimmunity for claims that fall within the scope of that \nright of action. The FTCA provides that, with some ex-\nceptions, the United States shall be liable for torts to \nthe same extent as a private person under similar cir-\ncumstances. It does so by adopting as its standard for \nliability the principles of state tort law that would be \napplicable to a private person in the state where the \nallegedly tortious conduct occurred.  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n1 This brief was not authored in whole or part by counsel for \na party. No one other than amicus curiae made a monetary con-\ntribution to preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \n \nUnder the FTCA, those state-law principles do not \napply to claims against the United States by their own \nforce, but because Congress enacted a statute mandat-\ning their application. To ensure that its chosen stand-\nard of liability would not adversely affect legitimate \ngovernment interests, Congress also enacted a baker\u2019s \ndozen of exceptions excusing the United States from \nliability for injuries even if the conduct causing them \nwould be tortious under state law if committed by a \nprivate person. \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit held that the \nConstitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause bars enforcement of \nthe FTCA\u2019s requirement that the tort liability of the \nUnited States be based on principles borrowed from \nstate tort law. According to the court of appeals, the \nSupremacy Clause prohibits imposition of tort liabil-\nity on the United States under the FTCA if the tor-\ntious acts \u201chave some nexus with furthering federal \npolicy and can reasonably be characterized as comply-\ning with the full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 11a \n(quoting Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, \n1293 (11th Cir. 2022), and Denson v. United States, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1344 (11th Cir. 2009)). \nThat holding turns the Supremacy Clause upside-\ndown. The Supremacy Clause, as this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions have explained, is fundamentally a choice-of-law \nprovision, requiring courts to apply requirements of \nthe Constitution and federal laws enacted in accord-\nance with its provisions, notwithstanding purported \ncommands of state law to the contrary. Here, a federal \nlaw\u2014the FTCA\u2014dictates that the United States be \nheld liable in circumstances where a private person \nwould be liable under state tort law. The Supremacy \nClause therefore requires that the FTCA be treated as \nthe supreme law of the land and binds judges to apply \n\n \n3 \n \nthe standard of liability the FTCA specifies. Moreover, \nthe Supremacy Clause by its terms preempts a state \nlaw only to the extent that the state law provides \nsomething \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal law. But when federal \nlaw explicitly borrows state-law principles to supply \nthe federal rule of decision for courts to apply, the ap-\nplication of those principles is not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal \nlaw. \nThe court of appeals, however, held that courts \ncannot apply a federal statutory command that, in the \ncourt\u2019s view, is contrary to the purposes and objectives \nof federal law more generally. See Pet. App. 16a. At \nbest, the court has identified an implied conflict be-\ntween the FTCA\u2019s requirements and other supposed \nprinciples of federal law. But the Supremacy Clause \nhas nothing to do with claimed conflicts among federal \nlaws. Resolving tensions within the body of federal \nlaw is, as this Court has pointed out, an ordinary mat-\nter of federal statutory construction not governed by \nSupremacy Clause preemption principles. Thus, the \nanswer to the first question presented by this case\u2014\nwhether the Supremacy Clause bars FTCA claims in \nthe circumstances described by the court of appeals\u2014\nis unequivocally no. The determinative issue in the \ncase is therefore whether the claims at issue fall \nwithin an exception to the FTCA. \nARGUMENT \nI. Liability under the FTCA is imposed by \nfederal statute, not state law. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s erroneous invocation of the \nSupremacy Clause to restrict the application of fed-\neral statutory requirements rests on the mistaken \npremise that FTCA actions against the United States \nare \u201csuits under state law against federal officials \n\n \n4 \n \ncarrying out their executive duties\u201d and, therefore, \nmust be policed under the implied conflict preemption \ndoctrine to ensure that the \u201cstate-law liability\u201d they \nmay impose does not \u201cstand[ ] as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress.\u201d Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th at 1293 \n(quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). \nThat understanding of the FTCA is flatly wrong.  \nAn FTCA action is a suit under federal law that \nimposes federal-law liability through the application \nof rules of decision dictated by statutory provisions en-\nacted by Congress. The FTCA does not waive the sov-\nereign immunity of the United States against tort \ncauses of action that exist independently of federal \nlaw. Rather, the FTCA itself imposes the liabilities \nthat are subject to its waiver of sovereign immunity \nby providing that \u201c[t]he United States shall be liable\u201d \nin tort for actions of its officers, employees, and agen-\ncies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. The FTCA also creates a federal \ncause of action and grants the federal courts exclusive \njurisdiction to adjudicate actions asserting that cause \nof action. See id. \u00a7 1346(b). The statute specifies the \nprerequisites for bringing FTCA actions and the time \nin which they must be brought, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2675 & 2401; \nidentifies the basic legal principles that govern such \nclaims, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) & 2674; enumerates \u201cexcep-\ntions\u201d to liability that function as defenses, see id. \n\u00a7 2680; limits the remedies and attorney fees availa-\nble when liability is found, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 & 2678; \nspecifies the effect of a judgment in an FTCA action, \nsee id. \u00a7 2676; and provides that the FTCA is the ex-\nclusive remedy for injuries resulting from governmen-\ntal acts or omissions within its scope, see id. \u00a7 2679(b). \nIn short, the United States is liable under the FTCA \n\n \n5 \n \nonly when and to the extent that Congress has im-\nposed liability by statute. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the FTCA none-\ntheless involves \u201csuits under state law\u201d and \u201cstate-law \nliability\u201d reflects a misunderstanding of Congress\u2019s \ndecision to borrow state-law tort principles to define \nthe tort liability that the FTCA imposes. Specifically, \nthe FTCA provides that the United States is liable in \ntort \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a \nprivate individual under like circumstances,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2674\u2014that is, it is liable \u201cunder circum-\nstances where the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the \nlaw of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 1346(b); see also id. \u00a7 2672 (using same language \nto describe authority of federal agencies to settle tort \nclaims). \nThat language, however, does not suggest that \nstate law applies of its own force to the federal govern-\nment in FTCA actions or that the resulting liability is \nliability under state law. To the contrary, state tort \nprinciples apply only because, and to the extent that, \nCongress has chosen to use them as the standard for \nthe liability that the FTCA creates. Indeed, the state-\nlaw principles that Congress incorporated to deter-\nmine the liability of the United States under the \nFTCA do so wholly without regard to whether they are \napplicable to the United States or any other govern-\nmental body under state law. For example, this Court \nlong ago held that state tort defenses and other limi-\ntations on liability applicable to government defend-\nants are not incorporated in the FTCA. See United \nStates v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 164\u201365 (1963); Indian \nTowing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 65 (1955). \nThus, the FTCA does not provide that the United \n\n \n6 \n \nStates is liable when state law says it (or government \nentities more generally) is liable, but instead that it is \nliable under circumstances similar to those in which \nstate law would say that someone else (a private per-\nson) would be liable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The imposi-\ntion of liability on the United States in such circum-\nstances does not find its source in state law, but is en-\ntirely the creation of a federal statute. \nMoreover, Congress adopted special defenses not \notherwise available under state law to ensure that its \nchoice of using state tort principles applicable to pri-\nvate actors does not impinge on federal governmental \ninterests. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680; Muniz, 374 U.S. at 163 \n(\u201cCongress has taken steps to protect the Government \nfrom liability that would seriously handicap efficient \ngovernment operations.\u201d). Those defenses, where ap-\nplicable, exclude liability for such things as the exer-\ncise of discretionary governmental functions, id. \n\u00a7 2680(a), \nnegligent \ntransmission \nof \nmail, \nid. \n\u00a7 2680(b), imposition of quarantines, id. \u00a7 2680(f); \ncommission of certain intentional torts, id. \u00a7 2680(h); \nregulation of the monetary system, id. \u00a7 2680(i), and \ncombat operations of the armed forces, id. \u00a7 2680(j). \nThe statute also incorporates certain federal govern-\nmental immunities, id. \u00a7 2674 (third paragraph), and \nexcludes constitutional torts and certain federal stat-\nutory claims, id. \u00a7 2679(b)(2). The result of this retic-\nulated federal statutory scheme is a form of liability \nthat no state purports to or could impose on the United \nStates: namely, liability in circumstances analogous \nto those under which state law would recognize pri-\nvate tort liability, but subject to defenses and other \nprocedural and substantive limitations designed by \nCongress to balance federal government interests \n\n \n7 \n \nagainst the interest in providing recovery to persons \ninjured by negligent or wrongful government actions. \nAlthough this Court has occasionally referred in \nshorthand to FTCA actions against the United States \nas involving \u201cstate-law tort suits against the Federal \nGovernment,\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, 210 \n(2021), its decisions have consistently recognized that \nthe liability of the United States in such actions is \ngrounded on federal law, in the form of a statute en-\nacted by Congress. For example, in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 \nU.S. 471 (1994), the Court observed that, through the \nFTCA\u2014and specifically through the language codified \nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)\u2014\u201cthe United States has \u2026 \u2018ren-\nder[ed]\u2019 itself liable\u201d for torts in circumstances in \nwhich state law would hold a private person liable. Id. \nat 477 (emphasis added; quoting Richards v. United \nStates, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962)). The Court has explicitly \nrecognized that \u201cwhether a private person would be \nresponsible for similar negligence under the laws of \nthe State where the acts occurred\u201d is \u201cthe test estab-\nlished by the Tort Claims Act for determining the \nUnited States\u2019 liability.\u201d Rayonier Inc. v. United \nStates, 352 U.S. 315, 319 (1957). The standard of lia-\nbility \u201cis controlled by a formal expression of the will \nof Congress,\u201d Richards, 369 U.S. at 7, which deter-\nmines the scope of the \u201cremedies provided by Con-\ngress,\u201d Muniz, 374 U.S. at 165\u201366. Thus, whether a \nprivate person would be liable for similar conduct un-\nder state tort law is one of the \u201celements\u201d of the federal \ncause of action created by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Brown-\nback, 592 U.S. at 212; see also id. at 216 (\u201c[O]ne ele-\nment of an FTCA claim is that the plaintiff establish \nthat the Government employee would be liable under \nstate law.\u201d).  \n\n \n8 \n \nThis Court\u2019s consistent readings of the FTCA con-\nfirm what is plain from the statutory language. State \nlaw itself does not impose liability under the FTCA. \nState-law principles that would apply to the liability \nof private persons are used as part of the determina-\ntion of the liability of the United States only because \na federal law duly enacted by Congress so requires. \nII. The Supremacy Clause does not limit, but \nrather requires, application of federal law. \nThe Supremacy Clause dictates that federal laws \nenacted pursuant to the Constitution are the law of \nthe land, and it resolves conflicts between the com-\nmands of federal laws and contrary state laws. The \nClause thus compels adherence to the FTCA\u2019s di-\nrective that state-law principles that would apply to \nprivate tortfeasors form the basis of the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s tort liability. The application of those prin-\nciples cannot be contrary to federal law when federal \nlaw expressly requires their application. \nThe Supremacy Clause provides that \u201c[t]his Con-\nstitution, and the Laws of the United States which \nshall be made in Pursuance thereof \u2026 shall be the su-\npreme Law of the Land; \u2026 any Thing in the Constitu-\ntion or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwith-\nstanding.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. The Supremacy \nClause requires \u201cpreemption\u201d of state laws where giv-\ning them effect would be in derogation of the suprem-\nacy of the Constitution or a valid federal law enacted \nunder it\u2014that is, where state law stands in contradic-\ntion to some applicable command of federal law. See \nMurphy v. NCAA, 584 U.S. 453, 477 (2018). All forms \nof preemption, in other words, involve \u201ca clash be-\ntween a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s legisla-\ntive power and conflicting state law.\u201d Murphy, 584 \n\n \n9 \n \nU.S. at 479. Where such a clash occurs, the Supremacy \nClause provides a \u201crule of decision\u201d: Courts must give \neffect to the federal law, not the conflicting state one. \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 324 (2015).  \nMore broadly, the Constitution\u2019s creation of a sov-\nereign federal union under a government that, \u201cwithin \nits own sphere,\u201d is \u201csupreme\u201d necessarily \u201cexempt[s] \n[that government\u2019s] operations from [the] influence\u201d of \n\u201cpower vested in subordinate governments.\u201d McCul-\nloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 427 (1819). That is, \u201cthe \nactivities of the Federal Government are free from \nregulation by any state,\u201d Mayo v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 441, 445 (1943), because a \u201csubordinate sover-\neign\u201d cannot control the government of the United \nStates without its consent, Hancock v. Train, 426 U.S. \n167, 179 (1976). As this Court recently explained, \n\u201c[t]he Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause generally im-\nmunizes the Federal Government from state laws that \ndirectly regulate or discriminate against it.\u201d United \nStates v. Washington, 596 U.S. 832, 835 (2022). \nBecause preemption under the Supremacy Clause \nis always triggered by a clash between federal and \nstate law, however, the Supremacy Clause allows even \ndirect application of state regulations to the federal \ngovernment if authorized by a federal statute. In that \ncircumstance, state regulation is in conformity with, \nnot contrary to, the laws of the United States. See \nUnited States v. Washington, 596 U.S. at 839\u201340. \nLikewise, not all differences between state law and \nfederal law, or all impacts of state laws on federal gov-\nernment interests, give rise to preemption, because \nnot all involve contradictory or conflicting federal and \nstate commands. See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda Motor \nof Am., Inc., 562 U.S. 323 (2011); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 \n\n \n10 \n \nU.S. 555 (2009); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 \nU.S. 51 (2002). And where a federal law authorizes or \ncontemplates the operation of state law, the federal \nlaw does not displace state law because giving it effect, \nas the Supremacy Clause demands, requires that \nstate law not be disturbed. Put another way, state \nlaws are not \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal laws that require or \npermit the state laws\u2019 operation.  \nThus, as this Court has said time and again,  \u201c[t]he \npurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u201d in de-\ntermining the preemptive effects of federal law. Retail \nClerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96, 103 \n(1963); see Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 578 \nU.S. 150, 162\u201363 (2016); Wyeth, 562 U.S. at 565. This \nproposition holds good in \u201cevery pre-emption case,\u201d \nHughes, 578 U.S. at 163, \u201c[w]hatever the category of \npreemption asserted\u201d\u2014be it express, implied, or field \npreemption. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. \n761, 785 (2019) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judg-\nment). \nIt follows that, in the first instance, \u201c \u2018[e]vidence of \npre-emptive purpose,\u2019 whether express or implied, \nmust \u2026 be \u2018sought in the text and structure of the stat-\nute at issue.\u2019 \u201d Va. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead \nopinion of Gorsuch, J.) (quoting CSX Transp., Inc. v. \nEasterwood, 507 U.S. 658, 664 (1993)). Thus, a litigant \nclaiming preemption based on conflict between state \nlaw and the requirements, purposes, or objectives of \nfederal law \u201cmust point specifically to \u2018a constitutional \ntext or a federal statute\u2019 that does the displacing or \nconflicts with state law.\u201d Id. at 767 (citation omitted). \nCourts considering such claims, moreover, must re-\nspect both \u201cwhat Congress wrote\u201d and \u201cwhat it didn\u2019t \nwrite.\u201d Id. at 765. The inquiry turns on \u201cwhat can be \n\n \n11 \n \nfound in the law itself,\u201d id. at 779, not on \u201cabstract and \nunenacted legislative desires,\u201d id. at 778. \nIn light of these principles, courts must give effect \nto federal statutory provisions whose terms manifest \nan intent to allow application of state laws even when \nthose laws might otherwise be impliedly preempted \nbecause of a conflict of some kind with federal law. \nSee, e.g., Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 575; Silkwood v. Kerr-\nMcGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 256 (1984). Disregard of \nsuch statutory provisions would violate the cardinal \nrule that preemption of whatever stripe\u2014express \npreemption, implied field preemption, or implied con-\nflict preemption\u2014is always a matter of congressional \nintent discernible from statutory text and structure. \nVa. Uranium, 587 U.S. at 778 (lead opinion of Gor-\nsuch, J.); id. at 785 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the \njudgment). When a federal statute allows or requires \nstate law to operate, effectuating the law enacted by \nCongress requires giving effect to its command that \nstate laws remain operative. If a federal statute does \nnot in some way require displacement of state law, \nsuch displacement cannot be necessary to ensure the \nfederal statute\u2019s \u201csupremacy.\u201d \nThus, the Court has repeatedly held that federal \nstatutes may limit or foreclose the otherwise preemp-\ntive effects of federal law. See, e.g., Calif. Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ass\u2019n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272 (1987); Malone v. \nWhite Motor Corp., 435 U.S. 497 (1978); Schermer-\nhorn, 375 U.S. 96. Such \u201cantipre-emption provisions,\u201d \nas Justice Scalia labeled them, Guerra, 479 U.S. at \n295 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), are, like \nother federal statutory commands, the law of the land \nand must be given effect under the Supremacy Clause.  \n\n \n12 \n \nIndeed, the Supremacy Clause effectively allows \nCongress to reverse the ordinary rule that federal law \npreempts conflicting state law and to provide that \nstate laws prevail in cases of conflict. For example, the \nCourt has held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \nwhich provides that no federal statute \u201cshall be con-\nstrued to invalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d state laws \nregulating the business of insurance, 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1012(b), functions as a reverse-preemption provi-\nsion: Where \u201cthere is a direct conflict between [a] fed-\neral \u2026 statute and [state] law,\u201d the \u201cterms of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act\u201d provide that \u201cfederal law \nmust yield.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, \n502 (1993). Because the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a \nlaw of the United States enacted pursuant to the Con-\nstitution, the Supremacy Clause dictates that its re-\nquirement that state law prevail over otherwise appli-\ncable federal law must be given effect. \nApplication of these principles allows no room for \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that the Supremacy \nClause overrides Congress\u2019s choice to impose liability \non the United States in circumstances where state tort \nlaw would make a private person liable. Indeed, this \ncase is easier from a Supremacy Clause standpoint \nthan cases involving \u201canti-preemption\u201d or \u201creverse \npreemption\u201d statutory provisions because here, unlike \nin those cases, Congress is not simply permitting state \nlaw to operate of its own force in areas where it argu-\nably comes into conflict with federal law. Rather, in \nenacting the FTCA, Congress unambiguously pre-\nscribed use of tort-law principles derived from state \nlaw as the federal rule of decision in cases arising un-\nder a federal statute. Where, as in this case, a \u201cLaw[ ] \nof the United States made in Pursuance\u201d of the Con-\nstitution prescribes a standard of liability, the \n\n \n13 \n \nSupremacy Clause makes that prescription \u201cthe su-\npreme Law of the Land\u201d and binds courts to follow it. \nU.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. Moreover, the application of \nthat standard\u2014even if it were being applied as the \nlaw of a state rather than as federal law\u2014could not \npossibly be considered \u201ccontrary\u201d to federal law when \nfederal law requires its application. The assertion that \na statute that adopts state laws as federal rules of de-\ncision manifests an intent to displace those laws is \nnonsensical. \nTo be sure, if a principle of state tort law were \npreempted or otherwise unconstitutional as applied to \nprivate persons, the FTCA would not mandate its ap-\nplication in a suit against the United States. That re-\nsult, however, would not follow from the Supremacy \nClause, but from the terms of the FTCA, which com-\nmand that (subject to the exceptions set forth in the \nstatute) courts hold the United States liable \u201cto the \nsame extent as a private individual under like circum-\nstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. If a rule of state tort liabil-\nity were unconstitutional as applied to private individ-\nuals, such individuals would not be liable under the \ncircumstances addressed by that rule, and therefore \nthe United States also could not be held liable in those \ncircumstances by the FTCA\u2019s plain terms.  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 application of the Supremacy \nClause, however, is not based on any supposed consti-\ntutional infirmity in the application of relevant state \ntort-law principles to private individuals. Rather, it \nposits that tort-law principles valid as to private indi-\nviduals may not, under the Supremacy Clause, be ap-\nplied to the federal government because doing so \nwould interfere with the lawful operation of the gov-\nernment. That view cannot be squared with the Su-\npremacy Clause because it fails to give effect to a law \n\n \n14 \n \nenacted by Congress, which the Supremacy Clause \nbinds courts to treat as paramount.2 \nIII. Supremacy \nClause \nimplied-preemption \nprinciples do not apply to asserted conflicts \nbetween or among federal laws. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s case law, in the guise of en-\nforcing the Supremacy Clause, holds a federal statu-\ntory requirement unenforceable because of a perceived \nconflict with the purposes and objectives of other (un-\nspecified) federal laws. Specifically, the court has held \nthat imposing liability based on the state-law tort \nprinciples whose application is called for by the FTCA \nis prohibited when the activity in which federal em-\nployees were engaged when they committed the alleg-\nedly tortious acts that injured the plaintiffs has \u201csome \nnexus with furthering federal policy and can reasona-\nbly be characterized as complying with the full range \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n2 Taken seriously, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view that Suprem-\nacy Clause principles must be applied in FTCA cases as if state \ntort-law principles apply to claims against the United States of \ntheir own force would nullify the FTCA\u2019s standard of liability. \nBecause states cannot unilaterally impose tort liability on the \nfederal government, the FTCA operates only because the United \nStates has the power to impose liability on itself based on state \ntort-law principles that could not otherwise be applied to the \nUnited States under the Supremacy Clause. Presumably, the \nEleventh Circuit does not think that the FTCA\u2019s standard of lia-\nbility is preempted in every case: It has continued to entertain \nsome FTCA actions asserting claims that the United States is \nliable for conduct that would be actionable under state law if per-\nformed by a private person. See, e.g., Smith v. United States, 7 \nF.4th 963 (11th Cir. 2021). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s apparent view \nthat the Supremacy Clause permits Congress to incorporate \nsome otherwise preempted state tort-law principles into the \nFTCA but not others lacks a principled basis for distinguishing \nwhich state-law principles can permissibly be incorporated and \nwhich cannot. \n\n \n15 \n \nof federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. The Eleventh Circuit \nexplicitly based this standard on this Court\u2019s \u201cpur-\nposes and objectives\u201d implied-preemption jurispru-\ndence. See Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293 (quoting Hines, \n312 U.S. at 67). That doctrine, controversial even in \ncases posing genuine Supremacy Clause issues arising \nfrom claimed conflicts between federal and state law, \nsee Kansas v. Garcia, 589 U.S. 191, 213 (2020) \n(Thomas, J., concurring), has no place in resolving \nclaimed conflicts or tensions among federal laws. \nAs this Court explained in POM Wonderful LLC v. \nCoca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102 (2014), cases involving \n\u201cthe alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one \nfederal statute by the provisions of another federal \nstatute\u201d (or, here, by the emanations of the entire body \nof federal law) are not governed by the Supremacy \nClause or by \u201cthe Court\u2019s complex categorization of the \ntypes of pre-emption.\u201d Id. at 111. Rather, resolving \ntensions within the body of federal laws is an issue of \n\u201cstatutory interpretation\u201d to which courts must apply \n\u201ctraditional rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d Id. at \n112. Those rules include the standards for determin-\ning whether one statute has been impliedly repealed \nby another whose terms are in irreconcilable conflict, \nand the canons of construction for determining \nwhether a more specific law clarifies or narrows a \nmore general law. See id. \nHere the Court need not delve into such issues in \ndetail because the applicable question presented is \nlimited to whether the Supremacy Clause bars appli-\ncation of the FTCA\u2019s standard of liability. Moreover, \nbecause the court of appeals did not purport to identify \nany basis in ordinary principles of statutory construc-\ntion for reading into the FTCA a broad exception for \nactions that have \u201csome nexus\u201d with federal policy and \n\n \n16 \n \ncan \u201creasonably be characterized as complying with \nthe full range of federal law,\u201d this Court need not ad-\ndress the merits of any such hypothetical justification \nfor the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. \nNonetheless, it is highly unlikely that traditional \nprinciples of statutory construction could ever justify \na limitation of the FTCA comparable to that imposed \nby the Eleventh Circuit. No ordinary canon of statu-\ntory construction allows a federal statute\u2019s unambigu-\nous choice of a standard of liability to be overridden by \na court\u2019s view of the unenacted purposes and objec-\ntives of federal law generally. The court of appeals\u2019 ap-\nproach reflects a sweeping assumption of authority to \ngo \u201caround or behind the words of the controlling text.\u201d \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law 18 \n(2012). And the court\u2019s appeal to purposes and objec-\ntives to override the text of a statutory provision at-\ntempts not just to \u201cachieve what [the court] believes to \nbe th[at] provision\u2019s purpose,\u201d id., but instead to \nachieve the purposes of federal law as a whole, unteth-\nered to the terms of any statute ever enacted by Con-\ngress. If such reliance on \u201csome brooding federal inter-\nest\u201d does not justify preemption of state law, Va. Ura-\nnium, 587 U.S. at 767 (lead opinion), it surely cannot \novercome the plain terms of a federal statute.  \nThe result of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding is the \ncreation of a broad and amorphous exception to the \nstatute potentially applicable to almost any case. In-\nnumerable federal actions have some \u201cnexus\u201d to fed-\neral policy and can at least be \u201ccharacterized\u201d as con-\nsistent with the \u201cfull range of federal law.\u201d Adopting \nsuch a sweeping exception to liability is inconsistent \nwith the many carefully crafted defenses already built \ninto the FTCA, and with this Court\u2019s approach to con-\nstruing it over the decades since its enactment\u2014an \n\n \n17 \n \napproach reflecting the view that \u201c[t]here is no justifi-\ncation for this Court to read exemptions into the Act \nbeyond those provided by Congress\u201d and that \u201c[i]f the \nAct is to be altered that is a function for the same body \nthat adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the \ncourt of appeals. \nRespectfully submitted, \nSCOTT L.

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

The district \ncourt\u2019s opinion, granting the government reconsidera-\ntion and dismissing the case, Pet. App. 20a, is unre-\nported but available as Martin v. United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 517, 536 (2008) (discussing how the \nFTCA was made retroactive because Congress wanted to provide \nrecovery for the Empire State Building crash victims); see also 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (making the FTCA effective for claims \u201caccruing \non and after January 1, 1945\u201d). \n\n34 \n \n \nperson not unduly sensitive as to his dignity.\u201d Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted). See also Ga. Code Ann. 51-1-13.\n11 \nTo determine whether the government is liable for \nbattery during a wrong-house raid, a court need not \nevaluate the legitimacy of any governmental policies. \nWe know this, in large part, because the FBI has no pol-\nicies governing the execution of SWAT raids. See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a). Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 335 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part). Three decades later, \u201ccourts are \nstill struggling.\u201d Xi, 68 F.4th at 842 (Bibas, J., concur-\nring). Third Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas recently ob-\nserved that there is still \u201csignificant confusion about \nhow to apply the test,\u201d leading to \u201cat least three \nlongstanding, recurring circuit splits involving the dis-\ncretionary-function exception.\u201d Id. at 843. Cf. Carter v. \nUnited States, 604 U.S. ___, 145 S. Ct. 519, 524 (2025) \n(mem.) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of cert.) \n(\u201cFaced with almost four decades of silence from this \nCourt on the Feres doctrine, lower courts have devel-\noped an array of tests for determining when it is trig-\ngered, leading to inconsistent results on similar facts.\u201d). \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.
